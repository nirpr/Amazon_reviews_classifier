The value was right and it seemed like a great solution for my tenor, alto, soprano practice room.  BUT, unfortunately it hasn't worked out.\nThere are 2 problems with this:\n\n1 - The stand does not work on any surface except a hard surface and even on a hard surface, I'm worried.  On any carpet, this is very unstable.  The problem are the two little feet that you can see next to the soprano pegs.  They are simply too short to be stable.  Turns out much of the weight of a sax is on those two little feet.  So on a carpet especially, the feet are pushed downward and the balance tips the saxes back and over.  Exactly what you don't want to happen.\n\n2 - The cushioned areas on the stand for the alto\/tenor spots don't work well for tenor.  The bottom of the bell hits the metal at the bottom of the brace.  Might be correctable if you made the lower cushion (not the top \"Y\" cushion but the second smaller cushion extended out a little.  Basically the whole tenor sax is flush against that metal rail and the bottom knocks on the sax.  So lay it on there very slowly because it will touch metal to metal.  Over time, I'm sure this will wear off the lacquer at the minimum.\n\nOverall, like I said, I wanted to like this stand but it didn't happen.

The bases fit, but the poles do not.  We have the On-Stage Quick Release Round Base Mic Stands, model MS7201QRB, paired with the Top Mount Euro-Style Tele Boom, model MSA-7040 TB.  The pole sleeve is too narrow to accommodate the bottom washer on the pole.  You have to remove it to put the pole in the sleeve, meaning the washer is easily lost.  The pole sleeve is also too narrow to accommodate the quick release mechanism at the top of the pole.  The pole sleeve could be cut away so that the rest of the pole fits in the sleeve, but that still won't fix the problem.  When using the quick release bottom paired with the Tele Boom top, the pole assembly is too long to fit in the bag, no matter if the pole is in the sleeve or not.  So, to use this bag, the pole must be removed from the base, the bottom washer removed and stored somewhere else, and the top mount boom assembly must be removed and left loose in the bag.  That is really dumb.\n\nThe bag itself has reasonable construction, so it might be useful for other mic stand brands, but it won't fit their own On-Stage mic stands.

The only way you can receive any kind of help is through a third party yahoo group that you have to join or some random music bulletin board that's so obscure I can't even remember the name of it. There is no support forum on the company website at all in 2011 the time of this review. If you email them for help you will never get a response, PERIOD! You have to call them long distance and leave a message and sometime within the next 2 weeks they either call back or blow you off. I've had my software in a commercial studio down as long as 6 weeks with several voice mails left on the support line (no one has ever answered).\n\nI've asked the owner a man named Eric Persing who is nothing short of a complete genius at NAMM and in the Yahoo group publicly (as many others have) about the support and the technologies they are using. The people around him become outright hostile at the inquiry this online, ask him at NAMM face to face and boy watch out! It's like having a lawn gnome threaten you with a whooping. It's the Emperor's new clothes I've never seen anything like it. A software company without support in this day and age on the company website? They're a software company!\n\nSpectrasonics Makes some of the most cutting edge products in the industry but without proper technical support how can the software with any longevity be of any use? I hold a BSc CIS and have 20 years experience in information systems pertaining to digital media, Multi Media and am both Logic and Pro Tools certified. I've never seen anything like it. If your name isn't Quincy Jones or Baby Face Edmonds you're wasting your money, these people could care less about you.\n\nI want this review to be completely honest and is respect to spectrasonics defense they have done some really nice things for their customers. They have taken their $500 sample library and offered it to customers for $100. My opinion is that at the price they weren't selling a lot of them and the sounds should have been included in the software at purchase but still that's a very nice thing to do. They have also given upgrades for RMX for free for several years. One so significant it should have been a paid upgrade. Their Trilogy Bass emulator software is nothing short of genius and their Omnisphere Synth blows everything out of the water in the industry hands down.\n\nBut again I say what good is it if you can't receive tech support for software you've paid for if it doesn't work?\n\nBottom line as a studio owner RMX has cost me money in canceled sessions because they refuse to answer email and won't return phone calls if any for weeks. What are you supposed to tell a video game company or a movie studio when you can't make your deadline? Uhhh we're waiting for spectrasonics to authorize our software?\n\nI say it again the Emperor's new clothes, it's ludicrous.

It takes 2 or 3 hours to do this mod if you check the pedal after changing every 3 or 4 components to make sure you are not messing it up. The distortion side of the pedal is almost useable after modding. You lose the harshness you get when you turn the tone up, which is good, because you need to run it with a good bit more treble on the tone than before. So far, I'm not impressed and somewhat disappointed.\n\nI was VERY disappointed with what it did to the overdrive side. If you turn the mix to the OD side, it sucks the gain out and you end up with less than 25% of the gain you had before. You also have to dime the tone to get anything out of it. When you turn the mix to about 25% up, it begins highly favoring the distortion side. That's good, because this side of the pedal is worthless now.\n\nIf you prefer the overdrive side of this stock pedal, run away, because this mod will ruin your pedal. If you prefer the distortion side of the this stock pedal, still, run away. If you just want to mod a pedal for the experience and have no standards for what it sounds like afterward, then maybe you should give it a try.\n\n7\/20\/2015 UPDATE:\nI all but stopped using this pedal after I modded it, partially because the mod neutered it and partly because I bought a Tech21 DD3X Mod pedal, which is far superior in every imaginable aspect. So last night (2.5 years after modding), I pulled my pedal apart and returned it to near stock condition. I say \"near stock\" because I left a cap in that was the same value and left the diodes in because they affect the sound in no manner whatsoever. The info that comes with this kit does not help if you want to restore your pedal to a useful state, so you will need to do your homework if you don't like this mod (I can't imagine you would) and want to undo it. I found a schematic online that had a couple of mistakes, but I was able to use it.\n\nAfter listening to the pedal back in it's stock form again, I had to lower my review from 2 to 1 star and revise comments that were far too kind. The pedal is once again useable as more than a paperweight. It's not the greatest dirt pedal now, but I'll maybe use it occasionally now.\n\nNow that I know much more about pedal modding and pedal building, I would never buy a Fromel kit again. Many of the changes you make with this kit make no sense. Some of them are not even in the signal path. Some suck the gain out. Others suck the tone out. Sure, the components are a little better quality than stock, but the tiny difference those parts make are undetectable in a distortion pedal without seeing them on an oscilloscope. I don't know about you, but I use my pedals for what they do to the sound, not to see a little different jagged line on a screen.","summary":"This Kit Is A Bad Idea","unixReviewTime":1361145600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

It really makes it difficult to actually do any kind of recording with this as the mic pre's are so sensitive that even a low output guitar will clip the input with the gain turned all the way down. It has the same issue with Any line input, Di, etc. As some other reviewer stated, it doesn't work well with the SM57\/SM58......which are only two of the most common mics EVER!!! Chances are if you are buying a starter interface, you are picking up one of those mics to go with it. I purchased mine at Guitar Center for a little over $100 several years ago. I recently found two Shure variable pads which actually make this device halfway usable. Those cost me $35 each... so had I known, I would have just bought a decent $200 dollar interface and been done with it. I understand the concept of use what you have and don't spend too much time researching and buying gear because you can just invest the time in making and recording music and learning how to do that well, but please, read all of the one star reviews and don't buy this. I tried and tried and tried and tried to make stuff work with this... I'm an engineer that builds satellite uplink facilities, mind you...... and this thing is just not worth using.\nOther issues are the poor quality of the headphone amplifier and it not supporting certain impedances of real headphones. I have found crosstalk issues on the input monitoring\/playback blend. I would far rather just monitor my input through software.\nI could go on and on, but I'll just give you some suggestions that worked for me to replace this.\nI picked up an Apogee Jam for a guitar interface and an Apogee Mic 96k for a condenser mic. Both USB powered and are small and compact and easy to travel with. get a decent pair of headphones or IEM's for a bit of isolation and you can do a lot with these two things. When I go on longer trips, I even pack my Fender Greta tube amp and actually mic it with the Apogee Mic. It's wonderful and sounds excellent. I picked up a pop filter for doing vocals on it. I've recorded drums with it too and it even came out sounding better and clearer than the 5 drum mics run into a mixer which had its outputs run into.....yep. you guessed it. The AudioBox.\nIf I were to start over from scratch and was looking for something portable and inexpensive, I would get an Apogee ONE. It's basically a Jam and Apogee Mic in one box. Even has an XLR in and you can use the mic and guitar in at the same time.\nIf you need two mic pre's, I would go for a Duet. A bit more expensive, but well worth it for the extra I\/O.\nIf you want a really solid desktop interface, pick up a Universal Audio Apollo Twin Duo Thunderbolt. You won't be disappointed, nor will you have to replace it. You can even add more I\/O via ADAT.\nWhatever you decide to get, just don't get this AudioBox.","summary":"Don't waste your money.","unixReviewTime":1462060800,"vote":null,"style":{"Color:":" Blue"},"image":null}

The salesman at Sam Ash Music said it had served him well, and when comparing similar products by competitors that were around the same price range, he said this is the one.\n\nI think he meant well. I do not think he deliberately deceived me. i think he probably only used it on an OS no newer than Windows 7, or he may have used it on a MAC.\n\nYes, I had the perennial \"unknown device\" issue when I tried to install. What is interesting is that I normally just tear open the wrapper, decimate the box, take it out, plug it in and get to work, but not this time. This time for some unknown reason, I took the time to read the installation instructions. I downloaded software and driver updates and then proceeded to install the unit. I got the \"unknown device\".\n\nAfter a few uninstall\/reinstall attempts over a night, morning and early afternoon, even following the multiphase procedure on the support page, i submitted a service request ticket.\n\nHere is where I decided that Presonus is not my idea of a good product provider. I see a lot of discussion about this problem. So, it is obvious that Presonus is aware of the problem. Yet, there is no one available over the weekend to help customers through the issue. What if it is a procedure to follow or a file to download or even an issue that can be resolved via remote access? All of these would be fine. Then if there is no resolution the customer at least feels like Presonus cares about their customers enough to at least try. I am then not opposed to buying other Presonus product.\n\nI am not unrealistic. I know, sometimes even expect, products to fail prematurely or even to not work at all. However, what i do not expect is the company leaving their niche customer community without help from 5:00 p.m. Friday to 9:00 a.m. Monday morning (Central Time). maybe this is not an issue to some, but this is far below the \"fails to meet the standard\" grade in customer service for me. Does Presonus realize that there are competitors, very strong competitors, in the market? Does Presonus realize that once a customer has paid for the Presonus product, the $50 or so difference in price between theirs and a competitor's more expensive offering is not so great a chasm anymore?\n\nWhen I train sales professionals, I always tell them that mishaps and errors are almost inevitable. However, these are not what break business relationships. It is the lack or poor execution of a plan to address them. Presonus has made it into my \"what would be your response as a customer, if... ?\" lessons.\n\nI think it is obvious what my response was. I uninstalled all of the software, and once the replacement process is complete, I will de-register everything and delete my Presonus account.\n\nI am not angry.

Here's why:\n\nUpon setup, the PreSonus AudioBox USB wasn't being recognized by my MacAir (supposed to be plug\/play).  I am comfortable with tech equipment but still thought it could have been my mistake.\n\nI called the PreSonus tech line and was on hold for 35 minutes until closing time and then got a cheerful recording that they were closed and I should call back during business hours.  Okay, I'm still stuck so I called back the next day and waited about 40 minutes this time -- I don't blame the techs, they are understaffed.  When I finally got a tech he did a quick diagnostic and announced \"Yes, your AudioBox has a problem and we are aware of it.  We've had a problem with some units recently.\"  Great.  (BTW, how many is \"some\" units?  A hundred?  A thousand?)\n\nHe then told me to \"call Amazon\" about the return.  What?  Your company made the defective equipment and I wasn't going to re-pack the mic, cables, pop-filter, stand, headphones (from the full audio package I originally bought) just to return the AudioBox.  When I called back and spoke with a supervisor to get a phantom Return Authorization I was told the same thing.  The best he could do was \"send me a form\" so they would consider repairing it but he wouldn't even commit to a matter of weeks for turnaround.  Super.  They even wanted me to provide them with the unit's serial number so they could \"track the problem\".  Apparently track but ignore.  (If they are defective, recall them or do the right thing and replace without hassle.)\n\nFinally, because I was stuck with everything else, I ordered a new AudioBox (on its own, a separate order from Amazon) and then returned the old one in its place.  (I would have ordered a different brand but then I couldn't have returned the first AudioBox.)  Thankfully, the second AudioBox was not a lemon, too.\n\nAmazon handled the solo return perfectly and amazingly fast.  The refund was in my account the day after an easy UPS pick-up.  Really happy with Amazon but don't count on PreSonus.  Even their beloved software set-up was needlessly annoying -- do you really need a 28-digit key code???  This isn't a nuclear launch.  Also, the \"Studio One Artist 2\" software was overly convoluted (just the name hints at that -- call it \"1\" or \"2\" but not both).  Crappy manual as well.\n\nI ended up using their hardware but with Mac's GarageBand which was so much easier to deal with and learn.\n\nBottom line, order if you must, but beware.  Don't count on PreSonus corporate office for anything.  Consider other audio interfaces.  Zero stars for AudioBox USB, 4 stars for rest of equipment (in the original package -- see other review).  Headphones are a bit cheap but great mic.","summary":"BEWARE of PreSonus AudioBox!  Horrible Service.","unixReviewTime":1376697600,"vote":"8","style":{"Color:":" Blue"},"image":null}

It's the typical Behringer construction and I have no issues with. It's plastic yes, but as long as you're not waffle stomping the pedals.throwing them around, or other such intentional damage, it's going to last just fine. No issues there. I have a Boss BCB-60 (Enclosed board with a lid) that I take places multiple times a week and there's no damage to any of my pedals including a Behringer that I've had for 9 months now.\n\nThe Con's\n- The Repeat Rate function: I have 3 other delays from different companies and for the \"rate or time\" function they're all the same. The further to the right you turn the more time or space you have between repeats. That's not the case here, and the worst part is that when you have it on the longest delay time, it's still really quick and when you have the rate at 12 o'clock or further to the right, all you get is hissing feedback. The rate alone makes this pedal non-usable. I also wish it was labeled as \"time\" instead of rate. It's really really bad.\n\n- The Echo function. It does as it should but I wish it was labeled \"level\" instead of echo. I had to watch a few different tutorials to find out what the controls actually did.\n\n- The Intensity function is actually the \"rate\" function or how many times it repeats. I wish it was labeled as \"Rate\" instead of intensity. Intensity makes me think it's the \"level\" function when it's not.\n\n- FEED BACK and HISSING. When the pedal was on in my chain that's the most noticeable thing about it was that there was a really bad high pitched hissing when the controls were turned up to around half way, thankfully the bypass works. The hiss grew in intensity and I never had that going for more than a couple seconds before turning the pedal off. If you don't turn it off quickly, you could easily blow a speaker, or your ear drums.\n\nConclusion: Pass thing by. I cannot say that or emphasize that enough. PASS THIS THING UP! It's not that it's a Behringer and Behringer is bad or anything like that, I have couple other Behringer's that are just fantastic. The problem comes with the confusing labeling. The time, or rate being way to fast on its slowest settings and it's hissing and feedback issues. I bought this pedal to replace a really cheap delay that's a pile of garbage because it doesn't really delay, but now all I can say is that the pile of garbage is on the board and this one is going to be going into the garbage.","summary":"Not A Fan.

But after playing with this thing some more, its downright awful and can't do what it claims to do. I was having issues with the sound and tone of the harmony function so I set the pedal to only output the modified signal. I played a few notes from the Key of E, which is setting 5 and set it for the 6th interval (level +3 which is confusing as annoying as hell already). The following is a video I made. I played a few open notes and an open E chord.\n[...]\nAccording to Behringer Tech Support, they claimed something was wrong with the processor. I got a replacement. IT SOUNDED THE EXACT SAME!\nTerrible. Don't bother with this purchase. Total crap.\n\noriginal.\nI just got it last night and I played with it for a bit. It has a lot of functionality for a small, $45 pedal. It does what it says it does, however, I'm just left saddened that the effects sound as synthetic as they do. The directions aren't as helpful as they could be. It explains the dialing of the harmony and pitch but its still a bit confusing. I look forward to playing with it some more. Looking to get that 3rd or 5th harmony on the stuff I play. I won't have much use for the Whammy Bar and Flutter options unless I play a hard-tail. One thing I don't like is you need to physically change the knobs to use all the options. For example, if you're playing live or recording, there's no way you can use a Flutter or Divebomb option and also use the harmony or pitch shifter.","summary":"Harmony Option is downright awful.","unixReviewTime":1478131200,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}
{"overall":1,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"07 27, 2016","reviewerID":"AW3OEIJXZL0MN","asin":"B0016MJ1T2","reviewerName":"CD44","reviewText":"I bought this so that I could try a few additional tunings for some new songs I'm working on. My band does everything in either Drop C\/D Standard, or on a Standard 7 string (B Standard\/Drop A). Among other reasons, some riffs\/melodies I have in my head just sound better with a Low F# or G at the bottom, so I wanted to try this pedal as an option to get there without needing a third guitar live.\n\nThe sound quality is mostly fine. Obviously, as you step more then 4 semitones away from the original signal, it starts to sound fake, but that is true of all pitch shifter pedals and plug-ins. There are some odd sounds in the mid-range of my guitar's scale, but that's not why I'm returning this pedal.\n\nI'm returning it because:\nThe \"Detune\" function literally just makes your guitar slightly flat or slightly sharp. According to the manual, the adjustment is between -30 CENTS and +30 CENTS (not semtones; cents!). By the way, none of these numbers actually appear on the pedal itself, so if you're trying to set it to, say, 10 cents down, good luck with that. If this is something you can put to use, more power to you. It would be nice if they labeled the knob that controls it, so that you actually know what setting you're on!\n\nThe \"Pitch Shift\" function (what I bought it for) has seemingly arbitrary preset intervals that it can use, and you can't choose any other intervals. The options are -24, -12, -7, -5, -2, -1, +3, +4, +5, +7, +12, and +24 semitones. And once again, these numbers are nowehere to be found on the pedal itself, so you either have to memorize that ridiculous sequence, or carry the manual around with you at all times.\n\nActually, after checking the manual again, there is literally NOTHING that this pedal does, that actually corresponds to the numbers on the \"Pitch\" knob! So why are the numbers even there? +6 and -6? Why are you two even printed on this pedal? The only \"6\" anywhere in the manual is in the \"Harmonist\" mode, and the \"-6\" and \"+6\" on the pedal don't even correspond to the 6th interval; you set the knob on \"-6\" or \"+6\" to get an OCTAVE interval. *facepalm*\n\nSo, basically, you can go DOWN 1 semitone, but you can't go UP 1. You can go UP 3 semitones, but you can't go DOWN 3. If you're in standard tuning, and you want to try Pantera's D-flat tuning, or (old) In Flames's C Standard tuning, well, you can't! If you're in Drop D, and want to play some Five Finger Death Punch (Drop B) or new In Flames (Drop B-flat)...you can't! If you prefer to tune to E-flat, but want to get back to standard quickly...you can't! If you play a lot of music in Drop C\/D Standard, but want to jam with someone who plays in standard...you can't! It makes no sense! But I guess Behringer knows best which intervals you should be using as a guitarist. So drop your guitar by two octaves and shut up!\n\nAnd yes, I know I can just re-tune the guitar myself to get the tuning I want. I'd like to remind you that, if I were going to do that, then why did I bother buying a pitch shifter pedal? So I can re-tune to D Standard, THEN drop down 2 semitones with the pedal? Seriously, think about that for a second.\n\nLooking forward to trying a different pedal with more flexibility in pitch shifting options (ie, a pedal that HAS flexibility in pitch shifting options).","summary":"So you can go down 1 semitone, but you can't go up?","unixReviewTime":1469577600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

I do Not care what Anyone says this Guitar processor lacks too many features after all why buy are Guitar processor If It lacks too many major features? This Is Not a step up from the RP355 this has less features than the RP355 The Delta Lab Guitar processor has a many features and Sounds just as good and Is easier and faster to program and cost much less and Behringer makes good stuff too at a more reasonable price. And of course I had to buy a used one because I can Not afford a new one. My first Digitech was a GSP 2101 which I gave around $750.00 In around 1995 that was before all the false government bail outs when manufactures had to sell something of a good value to make money. The GSP 2101 did Not have a Drum machine or an Acoustic simulator and did Not have enough memory to used Giga Verb with other than a few effects, but was a monster awesome Sounding that Is got Me hooked on Digitech. Then Digitech for No reason discontinued the GSP and also because of a lack of money I did Not get the foot controller with the GSP 2101. In 2005 Some People wanted to get a band started so I bought a GNX3000 which has a Drum machine and Acoustic simulator but lacked Ducking or Shimmer reverb which I was already using In My Songs but Behriger RV600 gave Me back the Sound I was looking for. I compare this RP500 with the GNX3000 but this RP500 lacks a Drum machine and after I bought It I read the specifications there Is No listing for an Acoustic simulator but just like the GNX3000 It has a very nice Sounding Acoustic simulator but the Wah Wah Sounds terrible It Sounds like a busted speaker the GNX3000 Sounded better In fact I heard a $20.00 Wah Wah that Sounded better, I want to try Behringer Wah Wah, and I have Not found the Ducking or Shimmer reverb and of course It has No Drum machine where the RP355 has a Drum machine and Acoustic simulator and Ducking or Shimmer reverb when I bout the RP500 I thought It had all the features of the RP355 but No but what the RP500 has that the RP355 does Not have Is the Marshall JCM 2000 simulator which I think Sounds less dull than Marshall JCM 800 but a $15.00 Danelectro D-1 Sounds good too. The programming Is good once You figure It out. Good or bad Is a question here You can change to any 5 settings with one push of a switch but to get more settings You must push the up button then before It has a chance to change back push another button and If You mess up during a live performance that may be a problem. I Also used a ART tube pre amp In front. If You are looking for a more affordable Guitar processor Delta Labs makes one that has many good features Including a Drum machine and Sounds good too. I Am still trying to figure out what to do about the Drum machine Linux ArtistX has a Drum machine called Hydrogen which can be had for under $10.00 but I can Not get It to work the Operating System Itself works great. I should mention unlike the cheaper brands Digitech made of metal and are very durable.

My experience with HDE support was PERFECT ! I will update this review upon  receiving the new unit.\n\n----------------------------\n\nI ordered one of these because my brother had just ordered one that worked great! So I ordered one this week. What I received was not exactly the same. It looks like the same design and same parts but the graphic is different. The graphic does not halve the treble clef it just says USB Midi with a line around it. I thought \"big deal, its the same\". It's not the same. My MAC didn't read it the same as the one pictured in the ad did when I plugged my brother's in. The driver is freezing my midi control panel up. Furthermore it does not transmit or receive.\n\nAgain, my brother received the item with the graphic of the clef and staff, with the word \"midi\" to the left and the word \"usb\" to the right, AS PICTURED IN THIS AD. What I received was not this product. It looks similar but fails to function.\n\nA huge waste of time and money on expedited shipping only to be let down.\n\nI'm sure if the company had sent me the item pictured this would be a positive review of a working product. But that is not what happened.\n\nIF YOU ORDER MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHICH VERSION OF THIS PRODUCT YOU ARE GETTING. I am in the middle of the return process now... How Fun !! Instead of tracking tonight, or this week at all, with my new midi interface I will instead be hating the company, hating the product and wishing I never ordered through Amazon or through HDE.\n\nI should add that I have been working on Macs and PCs for years doing audio engineering and midi processing.

I believe the Chromacast one would be a much better choice and less expensive too.  Two nice thing I can say about it are--First, my Tenor ukulele fit inside it without any problems.  In fact it seemed to have a lot of space.  Second, there is no ugly branding or labeling on the outside of this case; unlike the Chromacast one.

Unfortunately, I stopped considering Behringers all together after I experience this one.\nThe speakers behaved drastically differently from the specification on the manual. This monitor did *not* give the advertised near-flat frequency responses. It had weird resonance in the case. High frequency was muddled. Lower range was over-amplified. It totally beats the purpose of monitor speakers.\nNaively, I believed that Behringer was lower-priced because it did not yet establish its brand name. It was not a good deal. It was waste of money.\n\nI am actually writing this review few years after hoping to help other shoppers. I should have purchased a Mackie, which I guess is considered a different class for good reasons.\n\nBy the way, even my PC speaker (Harman Kardon) gave better responses than this.","summary":"loud speaker but *not* a monitor speaker, *not* for professional or pro-sumers","unixReviewTime":1386460800,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

The value was right and it seemed like a great solution for my tenor, alto, soprano practice room.  BUT, unfortunately it hasn't worked out.\nThere are 2 problems with this:\n\n1 - The stand does not work on any surface except a hard surface and even on a hard surface, I'm worried.  On any carpet, this is very unstable.  The problem are the two little feet that you can see next to the soprano pegs.  They are simply too short to be stable.  Turns out much of the weight of a sax is on those two little feet.  So on a carpet especially, the feet are pushed downward and the balance tips the saxes back and over.  Exactly what you don't want to happen.\n\n2 - The cushioned areas on the stand for the alto\/tenor spots don't work well for tenor.  The bottom of the bell hits the metal at the bottom of the brace.  Might be correctable if you made the lower cushion (not the top \"Y\" cushion but the second smaller cushion extended out a little.  Basically the whole tenor sax is flush against that metal rail and the bottom knocks on the sax.  So lay it on there very slowly because it will touch metal to metal.  Over time, I'm sure this will wear off the lacquer at the minimum.\n\nOverall, like I said, I wanted to like this stand but it didn't happen.  For all you other sax players out there, move on and try something else.","summary":"2 MAJOR flaws with this.","unixReviewTime":1431993600,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

I recently purchased another accessory gig bag, this one is from Phitz, now THIS is what all bags should be made of... really touch design.

This guitar hasn't been in my house for an hour yet and already it's garbage.\n\nUPDATE!\nI thought I'd give the guitar a chance and get the string replaced at a music store and they wouldn't touch it.  Simply because the bridge is not molded properly and if an attempt is made to replace the string, the bridge could pop off in someone's face.  They also told me that the guitar shouldn't have cracked when it bumped the wall. I ended up spending about $150 for something decent from the music store.

New out of the box it had a discolord bridge. The Frets where not filed and sharp and the neck action was way to high.  However, it did sound really nice for the price.\n\nFiguring these problems were due to the cheapness of the model, I decided to take the step up and buy the EPI LES PAUL STANDARD PLAIN TOP.  Surely any guitar with a great name like this and a price around 500 bucks should be perfect.  WRONG.  NEW AND OUT OF THE BOX...First of all I noticed that the Volume and Tone knobs were so far off the guitar body that they looked like 4 ufos trying to land.  I tryed to help them land by pushing down on them and realized that the whole assembly was bolted in on an angle, making the stems crooked.  So, when you turn the knobs they didn't even line up with the body one side would raise farther in the air than the other.  Ok, I really don't like to get shocks off from things when I use them either.  The pickups make exploding noises that are not feedback to make sure your awake even when you are not even strumming it. The D string is dead at the 3rd fret...And lastly so far when I plug my MONSTER guitar cord into the guitar, I do like to be able to unplug it again without a fight. The Guitar's finished looked like it had be resanded, there are specks of black dirt in the paint...and there is to much grain marks in the wood and not enough PAINT.  And of course theres a spot where the red paint has left a birthmark in the yellow part of the top.  THE ONLY GOOD POINT, IS GREAT NECK ACTION.  MY INSPECTOR FOR BOTH GUITARS WAS INSPECTOR NO. 1.

The JJ is lower output so it does better on the low gain setting, adding just a little grain to the sound.  On the higher gain setting the distortion is smoother.  If I keep it I'll run this tube in it.\n\nThen I tried an EH 12AY7 which is a lower gain tube.  Surprisingly it is louder and buzzier than the JJ and stock tube.

{"overall":2,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"06 17, 2013","reviewerID":"AH2F47XZ5L8NR","asin":"B000W5DAVO","reviewerName":"Violet Deliriums","reviewText":"I own over 30 stompboxes. By brand name, about a third are Electro Harmonix. By type, about a third are modulations (flanger, phaser, chorus, tremolo, etc.). In other words, I like stompboxes, Electro-Harmonix, and modulation effects. Electro-Harmonix advertises the Stereo Electric Mistress as a special flanger\/chorus that can make the classic sounds of David Gilmour, Andy Summers, and so on. I am not convinced.\n\nThe first thing to know is that Electro-Harmonix currently makes three units with the \"Electric Mistress\" name on it:\n\n(1) Deluxe Electric Mistress -- This is the analog flanger used by Gilmour, Summers, etc. Along with the A\/DA and the MXR, it is one that gives classic flanger sounds. But these units are different! Compare by listening. For example, Van Halen used an MXR for \"Unchained\" vs. Deluxe Electric Mistress in \"Message in a Bottle\" or Heart's \"Barracuda\" for another flavor of the Mistress.) You get a set of classic sounds with each, but it is a large unit -- as most analog flangers are. (Look at the schematics and you will understand why analog flangers are so big.)\n\n(2) Neo Mistress -- This is the smallest Mistress. I have only heard these on YouTube demos, so I cannot attest to their quality. I am pretty sure it is a digital pedal, and it does not have the same controls as the Deluxe.\n\n(3) Stereo Electric Mistress -- This is a DIGITAL pedal (not analog) designed to make flanger and chorus effects in a medium-sized pedal.\n\nHOW I TESTED IT: I have tried the Stereo Electric Mistress through two amps (1973 Silverface Fender Twin Reverb and Fender 22W Supersonic) with two guitars (1993 American Standard Strat w\/lace sensor single coils & Blacktop HH Jaguar with Seymour Duncan SH-1 humbuckers). I have used YouTube demos made by Electro Harmonix as a guide to setting it, and I have about 20 of them written down. Plus I have experimented with my own settings.\n\nRESULTS: When I first got the Stereo Electric Mistress, I removed two pedals to fit it on, including my beloved Electro Harmonix Neo-Clone chorus (because I thought the Stereo Electric Mistress would cover the chorus). After a week of working with it, I took it off and put the Neo Clone back on because the Stereo Electric Mistress's chorus does not sound as good. So that was a fail.\n\nRecently, I have reorganized my pedalboard and opened up space so that I could have a chorus pedal in addition to the Stereo Electric Mistress. Because I am playing a lot of Police songs, I decided to give the Stereo Electric Mistress another chance. I am still not convinced.\n\nTo my ears, the Stereo Electric Mistress is a unique pedal -- and I have used it in spots for good effect. But If you are looking for the classic flanger sounds of the Deluxe Electric Mistress, you are not going to find it in the Stereo Electric Mistress. It is too dark and seems to suck tone as it cycles. If you want the classic Electric Mistress sounds, then you will need to get a Deluxe Electric Mistress or a Hartman Flanger. Since I want to be able to make sounds like Andy Summers did in the Police, I find this unit unacceptable. It simply does not work as advertised there, at least with the rigs I have tried. (To make Police sounds, I am using quality stompboxes: a Keeley compressor and a Line 6 DL4 delay, and the flanger is the only problem!)\n\nIf you are considering buying this unit, I recommend that you only do so if you can test it out (ideally with your rig -- at least bring your guitar and maybe a couple stompboxes like a distortion to the store and borrow an similar amp). Do not buy this based on descriptions or YouTube demos. The Stereo Electric Mistress is its own thing, and it may be what you are looking for. One place that it does excel is in the effects loop of an Electro-Harmonix Superego pedal, where it can really change the timbre and even enable pitch bends. But my complaint is that it does not do what the descriptions say it will.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for a good modulation to make Police or Pink Floyd like sounds, the Stereo Electric Mistress is a fail and I recommend either an Electro-Harmonix Deluxe Electric Mistress or a Hartman Flanger. I went with the Hartman because it takes up far less pedalboard real estate. If you have a SuperEgo, the Stereo Electric Mistress sounds great there.","summary":"I am not convinced","unixReviewTime":1371427200,"vote":"11","style":null,"image":null}

I had to by a new one: ~$20 (bone) from SM. The holes were not good, especially the ones for the tuning pegs they were touching each other. A lot of hammer work to get them in. The neck wasn't fitting in the body. A lot of work required to make it even and fitting in the body. The neck is overall well done, some work on the frets and a lot of lemon oil to apply but at the end the fretboard is good and the shape is confortable. I cut the top of the neck to have a Fender Telecaster shape. I'm very proud of it..... because it looks really nice. The original shape is really horrible.....\n\nBODY\nThe shape is good and the pieces (pickup and pickguard) are fitting well. The only problem was that some holes where not straight leaving the head of screws oblique. I applied some copper tape inside the pickups and electronics holes to avoid the radio effect: 20$ from SM. I had to buy 2 new Guitar Strap Buttons because the one in the kit were horrible and with too short screws.\n\nPICKUPS and ELECTRONICS\nThe electronic is not working well, the thin E string doesn't sound on the bridge pickup and the tone tune doesn't work at all. The output jack is really bad.... I keep it, but I'm planning to buy a new one.\n\nSTRING AND BRIDGE\nThe bottom holes in the bridge are missing so you need to replace the string with bullet strings (I bought the Fender vintage bullet strings) to have them in the right position. But I'm planning to make the holes. I have already bought String Ferrules from SM ($7\/8). The 6 Saddle Bridge Chrome is not working well and setup the action and the intonation is really hard and I really prefer the 3 Saddle.\n\nPICKGUARD\nI didn't like the pickguard white so I bought a black Fender Telecaster original part, but it doesn't fit in the holes (grrrrrr!!!!), so I had to finish the white one in black.\n\nFINAL COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION\nAt the end around 40 hrs of work to get it done.....It was my first one, so now I won't do the same mistakes again. What I can say is a lot of fun...... but a Squier......it sounds better and costs almost the same and at end it is a Fender....\nSo if you like to do some manual work, my suggestion is buy it. If you are looking for a good guitar you need to replace original pieces so you need to be sure that you can afford:\n- new pickups and electronics,\n- new bridge,\n- new strings,\n- good finishing and lacquer technique\n\nMy suggestion is to buy from SM the body and the neck and from Fender all the original parts. It will cost you more but it will be your real Custom Guitar....","summary":"A lot of re-work and some electric issues","unixReviewTime":1364169600,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

All that the gel and elastic in the shoulder pad is going to get you is a slightly better spread on the load. That effect with this strap is marginal; it did not provide any great relief for me.\n\nAnd there are other issues.\n\nAs many have mentioned the smallest size strap (Large) is WAY too long. Add in another $10 to the cost to take the strap to a shoe repair shop to have them take a good chunk of length out of the strap and restitch it. Even if you somehow needed all that length, since the shoulder pad is fixed, all that length only feeds out to the back end of your guitar, so the guitar will approach a vertical orientation. A superior strap design has adjustable straps on both ends. Not so with this one.\n\nAnother problem is the crazy hard thick leather on the front end attachment point\/hole. It's damn near impossible to get it onto a strap button. Oddly, the rear strap end is a softer leather and doesn't have this issue :\/\n\nThe front end of the strap also has a very hard, thick leather piece that has quite a bit of bulk to it. Probably not an issue with a typical guitar but on my SG, which has the front strap button on the back of the guitar near the neck, the twist due to the attachment point forces that hard bulky pad into my body which is annoying and uncomfortable (attaching the strap end the opposite way as is common with an SG doesn't help much). There is seemingly zero added functionality to this piece and it only serves as a place to attach a brand logo and\/or to make it look more expensive(?).\n\nSo this strap just isn't working for me. It only affords a modicum of increased comfort and there are too many other issues that simply have not been thought through.\n\nThe search for a more comfortable and better designed strap continues :(","summary":"Too many issues","unixReviewTime":1477612800,"vote":null,"style":{"Color:":" Black"},"image":null}

I had to drop to a Legere 3.\n2.  This is solid plastic so it does not vibrate as well as the cane reeds.  This means that I have to blow harder to get the same volume level.  It also means that the notes can sound somewhat muddled or stifled... particularly after 45 minutes of playing when there is quite a bit of spit clinging to the reed.  These reeds are meant to be played WHILE TOTALLY DRY.  As soon as any moisture (like spit) hits it, the sound quality goes down.\n\nI will say that I like Legere slightly better than the Plasticover reeds; those are just normal cane reeds with a plastic coating so they have even more problems than regular cane reeds in my opinion.

I repaired the zipper at a shop for ten bucks rather than shipping back and having to put new velcro on a new board.  Otherwise a good concept and good design.  My issue to give it so low a rating is due to break, and frankly and subjectively that its too big for my apartment.  It just has a big footprint.  I don't recommend it unless you are a gigging musician with a studio etc to need such a big piece.  Just sold it at a lost on clist and will either buy a smaller version like the 2, or check out some other custom boards on ebay.  good luck.\n\nalso wanted to copy and paste the following review from another user and say I AGREE!  I did one or two gigs, and all the pedals had completely come off the board, total bs.\n\nIf you're anything other than the very occasional musician, you'd be better off buying the version of this product with the hard case. I'm gigging 3-4 times a month and find that the soft case allows pedals to shift so much during transit that they come loose from the board. The padded flight case would hold pedals down more securely.\n\nBut there's more to the problem. First, the Velcro isn't anywhere near strong enough to hold down heavier pedals (e.g. a Digitech Whammy, even a Cry-Baby), which come loose even when picking the board up to put it in its case. I've ended up using cable ties wrapped around the crossbars to augment the Velcro. Second, the glue on the back of the supplied Velcro isn't strong enough to stay attached to many pedals. I've ended up using Gorilla glue to get the stuff to stick.\n\nI'm not sure there is any solution to these problems, since any pedal-board would have the same issues.\n\nHaving said that, it's a good solid pedal-board, probably the best available.","summary":"Otherwise a good concept and good design","unixReviewTime":1413936000,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Otherwise, I'd give it one star. Yes, it holds down the strings so you can play in a higher key. However, the design on this capo is awful and I can't recommend it.\n\nFirst of all, it is not adjustable, and out of the box, the spring tension is way tighter than it needs to be to get the job done. You need a fairly strong grip to spread it wide enough to install it. Once you do, the tension is so tight, it pulls the strings slightly, causing some tuning issues. The tension is so tight, if you have a chunky neck, you're going to have issues placing it higher than around the fifth fret.\n\nSecondly, when installed, the darned thing is an eye hazard. I don't like how the two prongs stick up.\n\nThirdly, the bar that comes in contact with the strings is very narrow and tapers even more narrow toward the high E string. My guess is that from a design standpoint, their thought was that the skinnier strings need less surface area to hold them down. I'm not sure that I agree. The fact that I experienced string pulling\/tuning issues leads me to believe they were wrong.\n\nYou can get a better capo for the same or less money.","summary":"Release the death grip!","unixReviewTime":1360281600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

I'd say most of the octave notes are in tune, but some of them are so out of tune that you would not ever want to play those two notes together and this is something I want to do. I've noticed that the tuning of many free reed instruments these days seems to be a real issue. I guess with Yamaha's reputation and the good reviews here I thought I would be avoiding this problem. Maybe I should have paid double for the 36 note Suzuki Melodian? Perhaps it would have the same issue? Not sure if I can return this item or not but if accurate tuning is an issue for you then buyer beware. If you are a beginner or hobbyist then perhaps you don't care.

I really liked how it looked, but, it felt very light and toyish in my hand. First noodlings on this were impressive when hooked up to speakers, the sound quality this thing generates are very clean and good. Controls are intuitive but would take some time to really tweak to your own personal flavor but the 150 presets are fun. I played with this for about 5 hours making dance songs and some cool ambient tracks and the batteries were almost dead. Now the reason I purchased was really to be able to record other devices like my microkorg and guitar and loop all together while overdubbing little tidbits from this. For me personally it failed. The microphone feature is cool but it takes two people to use effectively and the sound quality was sub-par. The loop banks need to be held down to record ( basically loosing a hand ) and once you overdub a loop bank its forever. Meaning, if you lay a drum track then a bass line on loop one then decide to throw in a synth lead over them but don't like how the synth lead turned out you cant simply just delete the synth part, you have to delete the whole loop and start over. Now anyone who has played on Korg X-Y pads know that it is a crap shoot when it comes to playing the exact thing twice, it takes a lot of practice so this really turns out to be what I had expected, a really cool music toy. There are a lot of features on this that make it appealing and I am no Kaossilator expert but for the money they are asking and the cons that I talked about earlier it lasted one day and I returned it.

Its an extremely flat response mic, not dynamic at all. I'm sure it would work well for some type of plays or film works where a depressing, flat sound is best. I think they made it that way to reduce background noise, but regardless this mic does not sound great at all. It is accurate though, I'll give it that. But its just a boring mic.

Brzozowski","reviewText":"I've noticed that most of these reviews are on recently purchased units.  I repair and build guitars, and one of these arrived at my shop for repair which was about a year old. In my opinion, there are some inherent problems with this unit that make it low quality.\nWhen intonating, the saddles on the bridge cannot move enough to keep it intonated correctly at the 12th and 24th position. It always goes sharp. So you have to adjust the whole bridge back with the little screws they provide for this purpose until the saddles come into range. That's why the bridge has the long slots. Once you begin to move the bridge back,(with strings loose, of course), the bridge posts are riding out further in the bridge slots, which puts the bridge behind the posts. The adjustment screws are terribly undersized, I believe only 2.5MM.  When you tighten the strings, the bridge will begin to slant up, putting undue stress on the posts, since now only the bridge wings are holding the whole setup to the posts.\nThe one that I received had bent posts from tilting bridge stress, and the threaded inserts had started to loosen in the low quality wood used in this unit. The bridge wings had started to move apart.  I was forced to rebuild the insert holes, replace both the inserts and the posts, and reassemble. Upon doing this, I found that one of the tuners had suffered a tooth skip, making it unusable for tuning. Also, the handles on the keys of the tuners come loose constantly, making it seem like there is a lot of play. Possibly putting Locktite on the key screws would help.\nI'd look for something a little more well built, if you consider yourself a lapsteel player who is concerned for correct tone across the entire board.\n\nUPDATE, June 2012:\nJust got another one of these in, a shop owner told me I could buy it for $25, case and all.  Perfect condition, not a scratch, save the bridge is again doing the same thing.  The posts are down in the wood and the bridge is coming up.  Will make repairs in my shop so it is proper and sell it at a small profit.  I'd stay away from these, just junk.","summary":"You get what you pay for","unixReviewTime":1309392000,"vote":"9","style":null,"image":null}

The backpack straps are comfortable, having lots of pockets is awesome.  The foam body probably won't protect well if the guitar is stepped on, etc.  But if the guitar takes a fall, the foam will probably take the shock better than a true hardshell case.  But the build quality seems to be problematic.  First, as others have noted, the zipper catches.  You have to work it a little to get the case open.  And the case is top heavy, and tends to fall over when you open it.  Be very careful, or your guitar will get dumped and scratched.  Those two problems were annoying, but not enough to turn me off of the case.  Then after one week of light use, the strap that keeps the top from opening all the way popped out.  Apparently it's held on by a single staple into foam!  I almost set my guitar right onto the staple before I noticed the problem!  I wasn't too bummed about that bc then I could open the case all the way, so it didn't topple over.  But then, after a couple of months, the hinges broke loose, and their screws were projecting into the case.  When I returned the case to the store where I bought it, they said that this was unusual.  But, fearing that the poorly attached strap would break again, causing the hinges to fail again, I decided to trade in for a different case.","summary":"If it were made better, it would be a great case","unixReviewTime":1404345600,"vote":"7","style":null,"image":null}

This is a seriously heavy hunk of metal that secures very poorly to a microphone boom via a single, small threaded screw, capped by a flimsy plastic hand twist.  Easily falls off the boom during attachment, and when it hits the floor, the plastic hand twist immediately breaks off (mine broke off during my first attachment).  It's just as well, however, as a pliers or a socket wrench is absolutely required to tighten the screw hard enough to keep the weight from moving about and\/or falling off.  This boom weight is a good idea....but an extremely poor design with no attention whatsoever given to weight symmetry within its own shape.  Most importantly,  a much more substantial bolt is needed to keep this monster weight from falling off and killing one of your pets!  And don't even think about repositioning it once it's finally bolted into place.  The position of everything on your boom has to be carefully aligned AFTER the weight is completely secured, or the entire top boom will rotate to the weights asymmetrical balance point, no matter how much you tighter the boom's securing bolt.  On a positive note, however, you could probably hang off the other end of the boom without tilting the rig.\n\n  One final caution.......the final total weight on the top boon may be so heavy with this weight plus mics, iPads, cables etc., that the mic stand's center securing nut may not be strong enough to prevent slow collapse of the entire upper rig into the bottom pole (especially with a flimsy mic stand).  To stop that dogged tendency of the upper pole to collapse,I had to tighten mine so much that I stripped my stand's metal secure nut, and wound up having to purchase an entirely new (and stronger) stand.

{"overall":2,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2012","reviewerID":"AT6CZDCP4TRGA","asin":"B0011Z87I0","reviewerName":"Eduardo Neecha","reviewText":"I hemmed and hawed about buying a pair of self-powered monitors versus a Dayton T-amp with a pair of Dayton bookshelf speakers (both very well reviewed on various audiophile discussion boards), which would have come in at just around a hundred bucks, but finally decided against it due to the sheer size of the speakers, plus the additional tangle of cords\/cables that would entail.  Then I started to read up on the M-Audio AV30s and AV40s, but kept hearing persistent complaints about poor reliability...so when I finally stumbled upon these, I was totally stoked by the price and the form factor---these are somewhere in the middle in terms of size between 6.5\" bookshelf speakers like the Daytons, and your typically tiny and tinny-sounding 2\" computer speakers.\n\nThese M1s have 3\" woofers, so of course you're not going to get thumping bass---since I despise techno and most forms of rap\/house anyway (mostly listen to jazz, classical, and vocal\/guitar-dominated rock and folk), this was not an issue.  Though I have to agree with the other reviewers that what bass they do put out is quick, tight and accurate.\n\nBut the real magic is in the tweeters: they are full 1\" silk domes, which is exactly what you want for stunning detail and clarity and imaging.  I have no idea why the Amazon listing for this product neglects to mention this outstanding fact.  Even the Dayton full-size bookshelf speaker has only a 3\/4\" tweeter, and what few 2.0 computer speakers that have tweeters, usually have only 1\/2 to 3\/4\" tweeters---this often produces a smeared and veiled quality to the upper mids and highs.  You usually have to pay $300 and up to get a 1\" tweeter in a pair of decent bookshelf speakers.  Just like the run of the mill Logitechs and Altec Lansings, Bose's computer speakers have 2\" single drivers as do their home theater \"jewel cubes\"---hence the common ditty, \"No highs, no lows, it must be Bose.\"\n\nThe Alesis tweeter is also remarkable for its non-fatiguing smoothness...I can listen to these speakers for hours and hours without the notorious \"listener fatigue\" that results from overly bright tweeters and their over-the-top treble.\n\nThere is a bass boost switch you can turn on, but like all \"bass boost\" settings, this simply exaggerates the mid-bass and creates a very unnatural sound---which, sadly enough, is what too many consumers are used to these days.  So if you like a smiley-shaped EQ curve (bass and treble maxed out), these are probably not the speakers for you...get a Klipsch or Logitech or Altec Lansing 2.1 system instead.\n\nThe other standout feature on these speakers that sealed the deal for me was the USB connection. Most computer speakers connect with the 1\/8\" headphone jack...which means that they are using your computer's built-in soundcard, which usually are mediocre at best, and on many lower-end laptops can be absolutely horrible (hissy and shrill).  With a USB connection, you are sidestepping the internal sound card and having the speakers' convert the signal directly, which yields by far the purest, noise-free sound output possible.  Standalone USB DACs (Digital Audio Converters) which do the same thing can go anywhere from $30 for the cheapest to several hundred bucks...so to have this already included in the system is really a HUGE treat!\n\nNow, to put this into perspective: these are NOT party speakers!  If you are dumb enough to try to use them in that capacity, you deserve to be bummed out.  They are also not home theater speakers, so while their voice reproduction is top-notch, you are not going to get deep rumbles and wall-shaking explosions (you really need a sub for that, in any case).  They are designed for nearfield listening at low to moderate volumes (about 70db tops).  They are not quite audiophile grade, but definitely mid-fi, which means several notches above the typical $50-200 computer speakers you are going to find at Best Buy if a balanced, accurate sound is what you are looking for...for eighty three bucks they are an absolute STEAL!\n\nUPDATE 10\/19\/12: I received the first Alesis speakers on October 9th, at which point I wrote the above review...LOVED them.  Less than a week later, the right speaker suddenly died for no apparent reason...I was using it only lightly, and with the volume only at the 9 to 10 o'clock position.  So, I figured this was just the luck of a draw, everyone gets a lemon once in a while.  So I shipped it back to Amazon, they had a new on my doorstep by 10\/18...and guess what?  This time, the right speaker was DEAD ON ARRIVAL!!!  ARRRRRRRGH!!!  I am wondering if I should go through the process one more time, or try something else.  Really really annoying because I otherwise love the sound quality!  Nothing else in this ballpark comes even close...but why oh why was the QA on this product so horrible???\n\n0 for 2...I'm sorry Alesis, I'm looking elsewhere now.\n\nDowngraded rating from 5 to 2 stars.","summary":"It's the TWEETER, stupid!

They are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neat.\n\nThey don't sound horrible.  I mean, they are not computer speakers or anything.  The sound is very forward, I would say harsh.  That's not uncommon among studio monitors.  There is definitely a lot of clarity here.  Not a ton of bass, but that's pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size.  There's a few schools of thought on studio monitors.  Some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music, others think they should sound more like a normal speaker.  These will be more pleasing to people interested in the first.  I definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this.  Any flaws would be quite noticeable.\n\nI previously used KRK RP8's so I can compare these to them.  Granted, they are larger and more expensive, although they are also budget monitors.  I liked them better than these.  They were clear but also sounded nicer and, of course, had much more bass.\n\nI was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in...see if I could improve the situation...BUT one of the speakers starts to buzz about 5 minutes after it's turned on.  The buzz increases in volume over time.  I tried moving them to a different location, turning the volume down, even disconnecting the audio feed (so they were only plugged into the power).  Nothing stopped the buzz.  If they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again, the buzz starts up in more like 10 or 20 seconds.  So I sent them back.  I wasn't really impressed with the sound and I'm definitely not satisfied with the quality control, so I'm going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead.  Maybe Behringer 3031a's or something.  I think it's worth an extra 200 dollars or so to get a full-sized monitor.","summary":"One speaker buzzed, both sounded just ok","unixReviewTime":1320710400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

I completely stopped using them after less than a month.\n\nI'll start with the rubber surface, since that's the main selling point. The rubber gives your hand a really firm grip and does what its designed to do. Almost no slippage at all, even after an extended practice session. However, I noticed that when I really started laying into the strings and playing heavily, I had a tendency to catch the rubber on the side of the pick with my treble strings. Not a huge deal, and mostly that was due to my playing style. I got around it with a little practice, but I didn't like having to change my style for the sake of a pick.\n\nThe longevity of the plastic leaves something to be desired. These picks wear out a lot more quickly than tortex, ultex or even the gel picks I have. With my acoustic guitars, you could see signs of wear after the first use (I use .13-gauge steel strings). That wouldn't be a problem if they were priced like normal picks, but as you can see here they're significantly higher (and for just a 6-pack instead of 12).\n\nLastly, I couldn't get over how flexible these picks are. It's awful for me. If your fingers are higher on the pick, closer to the base (leaving more room), it feels like about .50 mm thickness. If you move your fingers closer to the pointed end of the pick (leaving less room), it becomes a little more sturdy, but nothing like what I'd get from a .88 or above (I usually use 1.0 to 1.14mm, so it was a big difference). Chords were OK, but individual notes don't have that nice crisp sound I'm used to.\n\nIn the end, for me, I ended up with a pick that was too flexible and wore out too quickly -- but at least I could hold onto it really, really well. Good idea, but the execution leaves room for improvement.\n\nIf you're a guitar player who plays softly on light strings (or nylon), and you have plenty of budget for picks, you'll probably have a lot better luck than I did.","summary":"They don't slide, but they don't last either","unixReviewTime":1342396800,"vote":"25","style":null,"image":null}

The problem is the strings roll under my fingers when I try to bend notes or apply vibrato. I beliieve it is because of the nylon core, which Thomastik uses on many of their acoustic instrument strings. I suppose the string would be great on a fretless where vibrato is accomplished by rolling the finger over the string rather than by stretching and relaxing it, but for me, I could not take advantage of any tone enhancement that these strings might provide.

It is simply based on my own experience with this product.\n\nAt first, I loved this ukulele, because of the price and because of the smile on my daughter's face. After playing with it for a couple of weeks, however, she was cleaning up her room and moved a pile of blankets and pillows out of the way. She is 8, small and does not lift weights. After she was done cleaning up, she picked up the ukulele bag which had been in the pile of blankets and pillows. When she opened the bag with the ukulele inside of it, she found out that the neck had come completely off.\n\nShe was in tears, and I looked at it. The neck was stapled onto the body with two staples. Stapling it back on would be impossible, since they must have done it when the back of the ukulele had not been attached yet. Superglue-ing does not seem like a good idea, simply because the material is so thin and I can't tell whether it's some kind of hard paper of thin wood shavings.\n\nPRO: Can actually be tuned and stays in tune.\nCON: If you just want a ukulele as a wall decoration or some similar purpose, this is a good investment.","summary":"It's cute and pretty...and easily breaks","unixReviewTime":1357084800,"vote":null,"style":{"Size:":" Ukulele","Color:":" Pink"},"image":null}

On strictly clean sounds, the hiss is barely noticeable, but if you apply any gain at all, the hiss is horrible.  When I take this pedal out of the mix, my amp is dead-silent on clean settings and almost silent on high-gain settings.  Put this back in the middle (with no other pedals), and hiss-city.  The instructions say that \"on rare occasions, interference from OTHER sources may cause noise\" and to get rid of this, you unplug from the input, wait a minute and then plug back in.  Nope - didn't work.  I would never use this live or in recording - the noise is absolutely ridiculous.  And I was using a 9-volt battery, not a power supply.

It is now much more difficult to remove the instrument without the stand tipping over. There's an added chunk of rubber on each side - presumably intended to prevent a smaller headstock or neck rotating in the yoke, which just gets in the way.  With my basses- especially the 5 strings, it makes a very narrow gap between which to remove the neck, and requires the neck to be carefully aligned between the sides to clear them. More often then not, the neck hits the rubber block pulling the stand forward with the bass. It's bad enough that I may end up sending yet another back. The first one of these I ordered with its smooth fingers is the only one of three that has worked for me (the second was fully defective with a leg that was too short and not secured by the pivot rivet causing the whole thing to just collapse the first time I tried to set an instrument on it). The new one I just received is very hard to adjust for height- it appears the top tube might be slightly bent, but it could just be the clamp is very snug even when open. There's another thing, and isn't a functional issue, but the emblem is missing off of it. Given that I've ordered three and only one was truly defect free, that little detail causes me to really questioning K&M's quality control. The redesign of the yoke is also seriously questionable. One of my favorite features of the original one I bought WAS how easy it is to grab and remove the instrument one handed. Add to all of this the fact that K&M never responded to a customer service email I sent over a month ago, and I can't recommend this product and am reducing my star rating to two.\n\nLong review below with a several updates- short version: Loved the first one I bought so I bought another. Second one defective, thought it was a design flaw (update 1 below), but after some investigation appears just have been a manufacturing whoops where one leg didn't get cut \/ assembled correctly (update 2 below). My rating went from Five to Two and back to Four stars. Then down to ONE. Had another part fail preparing to pack the second one to send back (update 3). Back up to 4 stars, see update 4- bought another brand stand and realize I still like quite a bit about the K&M despite its short comings. A bit of a roller coaster love affair with this thing, I know. The updates are in reverse-chron order, newest first. My original glowing review is at the bottom.\n\nFinal bottom line: elegantly designed, lightweight, folds very compact, but fragile. Ideal for those who need a hanging stand to take to gigs that folds small, and adds little weight to the load in\/out. Hanging stands are necessary for offset and odd shaped bodies such as explorers, jazz basses, etc. They are ideal for one hand grabs without having cords, straps, etc snag on the stand. I still feel the K&M could be a little more durable (inner extension stop and adjustment clamp once tubes are separated appear to be the weak links), but as long as you understand the tradeoffs, this is a very good stand. If you'll mostly leave it setup, the Hercules are really quite good, and the added weight makes it more stable when unloaded (perhaps look at the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hamilton-Hanging-Guitar-Stand-Black\/dp\/B001L8IJDU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hamilton Hanging Guitar Stand, Black<\/a>&nbsp;too).\n\nUpdate 4: Just bought a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hercules-GS414B-A-G-Guitar-Stand\/dp\/B000EEHKVY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hercules GS414B A\/G Guitar Stand<\/a>, which very close in price to this one. It's heavier and bulkier (and not being the folding yoke model, doesn't fold up very small). It works well and is pretty simple, but comparing it to the K&M it made me realize I still like the K&M quite a bit despite my frustration detailed below. Both work very well. The Hercules is likely more tolerant of abuse -though I have concerns about the complex \"locking\" fingers on the yoke. I'm not convinced they're necessary either. Comparing the two, the K&M seems like the better design- the arms actually rotate inward to grab the neck tighter as weight is applied whereas the Hercules just have rotating fingers which block the instrument neck from doing what seems very unlikely in the first place. Given the back angle, the force required for a neck to fall off the front of the yoke would certainly tip the whole stand over, instrument and all. A heavy enough instrument leaning against the padded legs really can't twist enough - again without so much force as to knock the whole thing over anyhow. I believe they are there for piece of mind, mostly - perhaps a small light instrument which doesn't rest against the legs could twist and fall off, but a bass or heavy electric guitar really couldn't. Basically, the instrument would have to be lighter than the 4.06lb stand (2.7lb K&M).\n\nUpdate 3: Just had another failure. I picked up the folded stand by the yoke and the upper section clamp wasn't latched, so the bottom half extended downward and the whole thing just fell apart. The clamp doesn't latch now, and the top half just pulls all the way out. Tipping the bottom half upside down and a couple parts fall out. I can't make sense of them or put it back together. This happened on the stand I'm already sending back (defective leg, now two defects) but I guess I'm done with this stand altogether. I absolutely cannot recommend it as I do not trust it one bit now. Exceptionally fragile. I really wanted to like it and this just makes me sad. Scratch sad, angry. I just  can't accept two unrelated defects on a product with so few parts. This suggests bigger QC issues. And throw in that the defective leg cost me a ding in my wall and a couple dings on a bass as it fell over. Scratch angry, hopping mad. Ignore everything nice I had to say about the product below.\n\nUpdate 2: Revised stars again- back up to four... I've investigated this further and my confidence is somewhat restored pending confirmation from K&M (I emailed them with my concerns). I decided to measure the depth of the leg socket to see how deep the leg fit in the hinge. A little over an inch to the hinge rivet- but it appears as if this leg only fits in about 3\/4\". I could not believe that not only did the hinge rivet not mount through the leg tube, but that 3\/4\" was deemed sufficient... then I noticed that this leg appeared shorter than the other. Yes. Hmmm. Perhaps the other legs DO extend past the pivot so the rivet goes through the leg too... So I stacked up some strong neo magnets and decided to check out the other legs on both stands. With this crude method, it appears as if the the tubes DO extend past the hinge pivot- on all but the defective leg. So there we have it (I think). I'll sleep on it and decide if I'm keeping the first one.\n\nUpdated Bottom line: My initial review below stands - mostly. Defects happen. If I wasn't so cheap, I'd just buy one each of the competing stands (Hercules, Ultimate, Hamilton) and make a truly informed decision. I may replace the second with the Hercules just for comparison. My sense is this one still has the edge for weight, ease of use and brilliantly simple design. The leg issue on the second one shook my conviction about it a bit, but it is pretty clear to me that it was just a pure defect and not a design issue. Nothing about that one defect appears to besmirch the whole product- really just a fluke that would easily pass visual QC inspection. I still love much about the first stand- especially packing it up and taking it with me. How many products are as fun to fold up and put away as they are to use?!\n\nUpdate 1: I liked the first so much (rated 5 stars), I ordered a second. The second one arrived defective- one leg pops out with any pressure on it. This means the stand just collapses with my precious instrument on it (eek). The leg hinges, adjusting clamps and top portion while mostly reinforced plastic, seemed very well engineered.  However it appears the joint between the leg and the hinge is just a force fit. On the defective one, the hinge is distorted such that the leg tube fit is not tight. It wasn't apparent on the first one, but this looks like a real durability problem. Worse, it wasn't apparent the first time I tried to hang an instrument on it. It was very apparent when my bass crashed into the wall as the stand collapsed under its weight. I had assumed the leg went into the hinge far enough that the steel pivot rivet went through the hinge AND the leg tube, but it does not (edit: on this one defective leg, apparently). This is a potential deal breaker for me, as this will be a high stress part of the stand.  I understand that manufacturing defects do occur, however this seems to me to be a critical design flaw, so I've reduced my rating to two stars. I simply cannot recommend it as it is (edit: see below). In light of this, I may send both back and try the heavier Hercules or Hamilton stands. If you have this stand, make sure you inspect that the legs fit tight!\n\nAnyone concerned that their legs may be so afflicted - it is unlikely, but you could also try the magnet test to try to determine where the leg tube ends. With a strong enough magnet, it is very apparent where the leg ends. On a properly assembled leg, you can feel the pull of the magnet towards the leg all the way up to just above the hinge pin. ON the defective leg, it stops well short of the hinge pin.\n\nMy original review follows:\nI just received it. What a brilliant design. So simple, yet so effective. When loaded with an instrument, this simple light stand is rock steady with a low center of gravity. It folds up so small and light compared to the others in this class, and with such a brilliantly simple pair of latching cam clamps. The hanging yoke folds back over itself flat with the main tube. The yoke has an automatic grip which does effectively the same thing as the Hercules, but appears to be a much simpler - and perhaps much more elegant design, with way fewer moving parts. I don't have any personal experience with the Hercules stands, and they certainly have a strong following. But I suspect a that they apparently outsell K&M on Amazon has at least a little to do with how widely they are distributed and marketed in the U.S. vs. K&M. The most competitive product from Hercules looks to be the GS415B, which weighs 4.4lbs, has a 12.2\" base radius and folds up to 28.8 x 4.5\". This K&M stand weighs 2.7lbs, roughly the same base radius and folds up to 21 x 3\". That makes it small and light enough to tuck in the outer pocket of my gig bag (Protec Contego, fits in about 3\/4 of the way). At present, this stand is also about $10 cheaper than the Hercules. Those not familiar with K&M should know they have a very solid reputation for their orchestral stand products as  well as their mic stands. They are generally more expensive than the competitive products, but generally worth every cent. This stand certainly lives up to that reputation in all but the price.\n\nAn observation about the weight. This light weight might have a downside- when it is unloaded, it is not as stable as when loaded. That may seem like a rather stupid thing to point out, I mean duh, it's lighter when it doesn't have a big heavy thing hanging from it. But that's the point- the very clever design relies on the mass provided by the instrument to provide the low center of gravity which makes it so stable. But the downside is when you pick the instrument up - especially on a padded carpeted floor, it tends to bounce a bit and want to fall backward. I could see that being a bit troublesome on stage when trying to swap instruments one handed, however most of the stages I see are not covered in plush shag with an inch of pad, so perhaps it won't be an issue. I guess my only real concern with this stand is the quality of the plastic parts and how well they will hold up. Only time will tell, but based on what I have seen from K&M in the past and reviews of this stand elsewhere, that shouldn't be an issue either.\n\nBottom line? Highly recommended as a lighter, simpler alternative to the Hercules. Definitely recommend over the Ultimate GS 1000, which is very similar in design and close in price, but in my biased estimation is a likely to be somewhat of an inferior knock off of this one- actually that's generally my  jaded opinion of most of what Ultimate sells- cheaper imitations of the superior K&M products, but more heavily marketed and more broadly distributed. K&M seems to put their business investment into thorough engineering and design, quality materials and stringent quality control.  Ultimate seems to invest in clever packaging of slick looking products backed by strong marketing broad distribution. I should disclose that I recently had a bad experience with an Ultimate double hanging guitar stand. I spent about 5 minutes with it before boxing it back up and requesting a return- it was REALLY cheaply made and completely unstable with just one instrument on it, but will admit it is targeted at a lower price point and not a competitor to this. Edit: I did buy Ultimate GS 100 which confirmed my assumptions. The height adjustment was also defective, so it went back. It was overall very flimsy, and the yoke shape didn't work well with 5 string bass- it sort of wedged onto the neck making the bass hard to remove. Ultimate support was VERY responsive to an email I sent about the defect though, which is more than I can say for K&M- I never got a reply to an email I sent over two months ago.","summary":"Loved the first stand, second one defective, redesign and possible defect on third may be a deal breaker","unixReviewTime":1365120000,"vote":"3","style":{"Color:":" Black"},"image":null}

Yes, with all the pedals off and the global settings in \"true bypass\" your tone will be unaffected (with the M13 in front of amp only).  However, soon as you activate any effect\/pedal the unit routes all signal to digital conversion.

There aren't even any dots on the neck to assist you in finger placement, so the educational value of this is questionable.\n\nI have since bought another guitar for $90, and the difference in quality is enough to encourage you to go ahead and start playing, instead of deterring you from it.\n\nIf you've ever held a decent guitar before, stay away from this as you won't even stand holding it.

New out of the box it had a discolord bridge. The Frets where not filed and sharp and the neck action was way to high.  However, it did sound really nice for the price.\n\nFiguring these problems were due to the cheapness of the model, I decided to take the step up and buy the EPI LES PAUL STANDARD PLAIN TOP.  Surely any guitar with a great name like this and a price around 500 bucks should be perfect.  WRONG.  NEW AND OUT OF THE BOX...First of all I noticed that the Volume and Tone knobs were so far off the guitar body that they looked like 4 ufos trying to land.  I tryed to help them land by pushing down on them and realized that the whole assembly was bolted in on an angle, making the stems crooked.  So, when you turn the knobs they didn't even line up with the body one side would raise farther in the air than the other.  Ok, I really don't like to get shocks off from things when I use them either.  The pickups make exploding noises that are not feedback to make sure your awake even when you are not even strumming it. The D string is dead at the 3rd fret...And lastly so far when I plug my MONSTER guitar cord into the guitar, I do like to be able to unplug it again without a fight. The Guitar's finished looked like it had be resanded, there are specks of black dirt in the paint...and there is to much grain marks in the wood and not enough PAINT.  And of course theres a spot where the red paint has left a birthmark in the yellow part of the top.  THE ONLY GOOD POINT, IS GREAT NECK ACTION.  MY INSPECTOR FOR BOTH GUITARS WAS INSPECTOR NO. 1.  I hope this review is helpful to someone out there because I thought this was a quality product.  Your not buying the product obviously, you are buying just the name.

On its high distortion setting it lacks richness and overtones associated with a more heavily driven tube amp and its too fuzzy.\n\nI swapped out the tube for a JJ 12 AX7 and that is better.  The JJ is lower output so it does better on the low gain setting, adding just a little grain to the sound.  On the higher gain setting the distortion is smoother.  If I keep it I'll run this tube in it.\n\nThen I tried an EH 12AY7 which is a lower gain tube.  Surprisingly it is louder and buzzier than the JJ and stock tube.

{"overall":2,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"06 17, 2013","reviewerID":"AH2F47XZ5L8NR","asin":"B000W5DAVO","reviewerName":"Violet Deliriums","reviewText":"I own over 30 stompboxes. By brand name, about a third are Electro Harmonix. By type, about a third are modulations (flanger, phaser, chorus, tremolo, etc.). In other words, I like stompboxes, Electro-Harmonix, and modulation effects. Electro-Harmonix advertises the Stereo Electric Mistress as a special flanger\/chorus that can make the classic sounds of David Gilmour, Andy Summers, and so on. I am not convinced.\n\nThe first thing to know is that Electro-Harmonix currently makes three units with the \"Electric Mistress\" name on it:\n\n(1) Deluxe Electric Mistress -- This is the analog flanger used by Gilmour, Summers, etc. Along with the A\/DA and the MXR, it is one that gives classic flanger sounds. But these units are different! Compare by listening. For example, Van Halen used an MXR for \"Unchained\" vs. Deluxe Electric Mistress in \"Message in a Bottle\" or Heart's \"Barracuda\" for another flavor of the Mistress.) You get a set of classic sounds with each, but it is a large unit -- as most analog flangers are. (Look at the schematics and you will understand why analog flangers are so big.)\n\n(2) Neo Mistress -- This is the smallest Mistress. I have only heard these on YouTube demos, so I cannot attest to their quality. I am pretty sure it is a digital pedal, and it does not have the same controls as the Deluxe.\n\n(3) Stereo Electric Mistress -- This is a DIGITAL pedal (not analog) designed to make flanger and chorus effects in a medium-sized pedal.\n\nHOW I TESTED IT: I have tried the Stereo Electric Mistress through two amps (1973 Silverface Fender Twin Reverb and Fender 22W Supersonic) with two guitars (1993 American Standard Strat w\/lace sensor single coils & Blacktop HH Jaguar with Seymour Duncan SH-1 humbuckers). I have used YouTube demos made by Electro Harmonix as a guide to setting it, and I have about 20 of them written down. Plus I have experimented with my own settings.\n\nRESULTS: When I first got the Stereo Electric Mistress, I removed two pedals to fit it on, including my beloved Electro Harmonix Neo-Clone chorus (because I thought the Stereo Electric Mistress would cover the chorus). After a week of working with it, I took it off and put the Neo Clone back on because the Stereo Electric Mistress's chorus does not sound as good. So that was a fail.\n\nRecently, I have reorganized my pedalboard and opened up space so that I could have a chorus pedal in addition to the Stereo Electric Mistress. Because I am playing a lot of Police songs, I decided to give the Stereo Electric Mistress another chance. I am still not convinced.\n\nTo my ears, the Stereo Electric Mistress is a unique pedal -- and I have used it in spots for good effect. But If you are looking for the classic flanger sounds of the Deluxe Electric Mistress, you are not going to find it in the Stereo Electric Mistress. It is too dark and seems to suck tone as it cycles. If you want the classic Electric Mistress sounds, then you will need to get a Deluxe Electric Mistress or a Hartman Flanger. Since I want to be able to make sounds like Andy Summers did in the Police, I find this unit unacceptable. It simply does not work as advertised there, at least with the rigs I have tried. (To make Police sounds, I am using quality stompboxes: a Keeley compressor and a Line 6 DL4 delay, and the flanger is the only problem!)\n\nIf you are considering buying this unit, I recommend that you only do so if you can test it out (ideally with your rig -- at least bring your guitar and maybe a couple stompboxes like a distortion to the store and borrow an similar amp). Do not buy this based on descriptions or YouTube demos. The Stereo Electric Mistress is its own thing, and it may be what you are looking for. One place that it does excel is in the effects loop of an Electro-Harmonix Superego pedal, where it can really change the timbre and even enable pitch bends. But my complaint is that it does not do what the descriptions say it will.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for a good modulation to make Police or Pink Floyd like sounds, the Stereo Electric Mistress is a fail and I recommend either an Electro-Harmonix Deluxe Electric Mistress or a Hartman Flanger. I went with the Hartman because it takes up far less pedalboard real estate. If you have a SuperEgo, the Stereo Electric Mistress sounds great there.","summary":"I am not convinced","unixReviewTime":1371427200,"vote":"11","style":null,"image":null}

I had to by a new one: ~$20 (bone) from SM. The holes were not good, especially the ones for the tuning pegs they were touching each other. A lot of hammer work to get them in. The neck wasn't fitting in the body. A lot of work required to make it even and fitting in the body. The neck is overall well done, some work on the frets and a lot of lemon oil to apply but at the end the fretboard is good and the shape is confortable. I cut the top of the neck to have a Fender Telecaster shape. I'm very proud of it..... because it looks really nice. The original shape is really horrible.....\n\nBODY\nThe shape is good and the pieces (pickup and pickguard) are fitting well. The only problem was that some holes where not straight leaving the head of screws oblique. I applied some copper tape inside the pickups and electronics holes to avoid the radio effect: 20$ from SM. I had to buy 2 new Guitar Strap Buttons because the one in the kit were horrible and with too short screws.\n\nPICKUPS and ELECTRONICS\nThe electronic is not working well, the thin E string doesn't sound on the bridge pickup and the tone tune doesn't work at all. The output jack is really bad.... I keep it, but I'm planning to buy a new one.\n\nSTRING AND BRIDGE\nThe bottom holes in the bridge are missing so you need to replace the string with bullet strings (I bought the Fender vintage bullet strings) to have them in the right position. But I'm planning to make the holes. I have already bought String Ferrules from SM ($7\/8). The 6 Saddle Bridge Chrome is not working well and setup the action and the intonation is really hard and I really prefer the 3 Saddle.\n\nPICKGUARD\nI didn't like the pickguard white so I bought a black Fender Telecaster original part, but it doesn't fit in the holes (grrrrrr!!!!), so I had to finish the white one in black.\n\nFINAL COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION\nAt the end around 40 hrs of work to get it done.....It was my first one, so now I won't do the same mistakes again. What I can say is a lot of fun...... but a Squier......it sounds better and costs almost the same and at end it is a Fender....\nSo if you like to do some manual work, my suggestion is buy it. If you are looking for a good guitar you need to replace original pieces so you need to be sure that you can afford:\n- new pickups and electronics,\n- new bridge,\n- new strings,\n- good finishing and lacquer technique\n\nMy suggestion is to buy from SM the body and the neck and from Fender all the original parts.

All that the gel and elastic in the shoulder pad is going to get you is a slightly better spread on the load. That effect with this strap is marginal; it did not provide any great relief for me.\n\nAnd there are other issues.\n\nAs many have mentioned the smallest size strap (Large) is WAY too long. Add in another $10 to the cost to take the strap to a shoe repair shop to have them take a good chunk of length out of the strap and restitch it. Even if you somehow needed all that length, since the shoulder pad is fixed, all that length only feeds out to the back end of your guitar, so the guitar will approach a vertical orientation. A superior strap design has adjustable straps on both ends. Not so with this one.\n\nAnother problem is the crazy hard thick leather on the front end attachment point\/hole. It's damn near impossible to get it onto a strap button. Oddly, the rear strap end is a softer leather and doesn't have this issue :\/\n\nThe front end of the strap also has a very hard, thick leather piece that has quite a bit of bulk to it. Probably not an issue with a typical guitar but on my SG, which has the front strap button on the back of the guitar near the neck, the twist due to the attachment point forces that hard bulky pad into my body which is annoying and uncomfortable (attaching the strap end the opposite way as is common with an SG doesn't help much). There is seemingly zero added functionality to this piece and it only serves as a place to attach a brand logo and\/or to make it look more expensive(?).\n\nSo this strap just isn't working for me. It only affords a modicum of increased comfort and there are too many other issues that simply have not been thought through.\n\nThe search for a more comfortable and better designed strap continues :(","summary":"Too many issues","unixReviewTime":1477612800,"vote":null,"style":{"Color:":" Black"},"image":null}

They may have fixed this since I last played on them, but I used to play on Mitchell Laurie 4 (sometimes 4.5) cane reeds and I couldn't get a single peep from a Legere 4 because it was too stiff.  I had to drop to a Legere 3.\n2.  This is solid plastic so it does not vibrate as well as the cane reeds.  This means that I have to blow harder to get the same volume level.  It also means that the notes can sound somewhat muddled or stifled... particularly after 45 minutes of playing when there is quite a bit of spit clinging to the reed.  These reeds are meant to be played WHILE TOTALLY DRY.  As soon as any moisture (like spit) hits it, the sound quality goes down.\n\nI will say that I like Legere slightly better than the Plasticover reeds; those are just normal cane reeds with a plastic coating so they have even more problems than regular cane reeds in my opinion.  However, if you want a really great reed that will last a long time, give you awesome musical quality, and has a sound similar to (but crisper than) regular cane, try Fibracell instead of Legere.","summary":"Sounds a bit stifled, try Fibracell instead","unixReviewTime":1391990400,"vote":"5","style":null,"image":null}

I repaired the zipper at a shop for ten bucks rather than shipping back and having to put new velcro on a new board.  Otherwise a good concept and good design.  My issue to give it so low a rating is due to break, and frankly and subjectively that its too big for my apartment.  It just has a big footprint.  I don't recommend it unless you are a gigging musician with a studio etc to need such a big piece.  Just sold it at a lost on clist and will either buy a smaller version like the 2, or check out some other custom boards on ebay.  good luck.\n\nalso wanted to copy and paste the following review from another user and say I AGREE!  I did one or two gigs, and all the pedals had completely come off the board, total bs.\n\nIf you're anything other than the very occasional musician, you'd be better off buying the version of this product with the hard case. I'm gigging 3-4 times a month and find that the soft case allows pedals to shift so much during transit that they come loose from the board. The padded flight case would hold pedals down more securely.\n\nBut there's more to the problem. First, the Velcro isn't anywhere near strong enough to hold down heavier pedals (e.g. a Digitech Whammy, even a Cry-Baby), which come loose even when picking the board up to put it in its case. I've ended up using cable ties wrapped around the crossbars to augment the Velcro. Second, the glue on the back of the supplied Velcro isn't strong enough to stay attached to many pedals. I've ended up using Gorilla glue to get the stuff to stick.\n\nI'm not sure there is any solution to these problems, since any pedal-board would have the same issues.\n\nHaving said that, it's a good solid pedal-board, probably the best available.","summary":"Otherwise a good concept and good design","unixReviewTime":1413936000,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Otherwise, I'd give it one star. Yes, it holds down the strings so you can play in a higher key. However, the design on this capo is awful and I can't recommend it.\n\nFirst of all, it is not adjustable, and out of the box, the spring tension is way tighter than it needs to be to get the job done. You need a fairly strong grip to spread it wide enough to install it. Once you do, the tension is so tight, it pulls the strings slightly, causing some tuning issues. The tension is so tight, if you have a chunky neck, you're going to have issues placing it higher than around the fifth fret.\n\nSecondly, when installed, the darned thing is an eye hazard. I don't like how the two prongs stick up.\n\nThirdly, the bar that comes in contact with the strings is very narrow and tapers even more narrow toward the high E string. My guess is that from a design standpoint, their thought was that the skinnier strings need less surface area to hold them down. I'm not sure that I agree. The fact that I experienced string pulling\/tuning issues leads me to believe they were wrong.\n\nYou can get a better capo for the same or less money.","summary":"Release the death grip!","unixReviewTime":1360281600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

The sound is wonderful, much nicer than the Hohner Piano 36 I used to own. However, the Pianica is not in tune with itself. My old Hohner Melodica was, at least when I first got it. I'd say most of the octave notes are in tune, but some of them are so out of tune that you would not ever want to play those two notes together and this is something I want to do. I've noticed that the tuning of many free reed instruments these days seems to be a real issue. I guess with Yamaha's reputation and the good reviews here I thought I would be avoiding this problem. Maybe I should have paid double for the 36 note Suzuki Melodian? Perhaps it would have the same issue? Not sure if I can return this item or not but if accurate tuning is an issue for you then buyer beware. If you are a beginner or hobbyist then perhaps you don't care. But if you are a professional or semi-professional musician then I think the tuning is unacceptable for a brand new out of the box instrument. Again, superior tone and quality of construction, but the tuning is just too much.

I really liked how it looked, but, it felt very light and toyish in my hand. First noodlings on this were impressive when hooked up to speakers, the sound quality this thing generates are very clean and good. Controls are intuitive but would take some time to really tweak to your own personal flavor but the 150 presets are fun. I played with this for about 5 hours making dance songs and some cool ambient tracks and the batteries were almost dead. Now the reason I purchased was really to be able to record other devices like my microkorg and guitar and loop all together while overdubbing little tidbits from this. For me personally it failed. The microphone feature is cool but it takes two people to use effectively and the sound quality was sub-par. The loop banks need to be held down to record ( basically loosing a hand ) and once you overdub a loop bank its forever. Meaning, if you lay a drum track then a bass line on loop one then decide to throw in a synth lead over them but don't like how the synth lead turned out you cant simply just delete the synth part, you have to delete the whole loop and start over. Now anyone who has played on Korg X-Y pads know that it is a crap shoot when it comes to playing the exact thing twice, it takes a lot of practice so this really turns out to be what I had expected, a really cool music toy. There are a lot of features on this that make it appealing and I am no Kaossilator expert but for the money they are asking and the cons that I talked about earlier it lasted one day and I returned it.

It works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion.  When used with a pedalboard rig, it doesn't add much except for hiss, unfortunately.  Sweet sound with an older Fender amp unit, though.  Does not sound good with updated equipment, Line 6 equipment, Roland units.  I'd say definitely do not get this if you're a tech or gear head.  Get it if you're a simple player with few FX in your arsenal.  It does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar, amp, wah, and guitar, or amp, wah, guitar, and expression pedal.  Nothing else I've tied it to has seemed to work out, though.  Probably a wasted product with where I'm headed as a technical player, but good for beginners and intermediate levels.

Brennan","reviewText":"Pros: The sound is very good to excellent, I noticed no holes in the range of the fretboard. I like the subdued dark color of it (the pickup not the sound), and the installation is easy enough. I noticed no problem with volume, it has as good an output as any of my passive electric guitar pickups. It is not a valid comparison to compare this to a powered acoustic pickup system. I did not have to change gain or volume levels past halfway for a good room-filling sound. The room I play in is a standard to small size parlor, and my amp of choice for this arena is a Bugera Vintage 5.\n\nThe price I got for this pickup was very good, less than thirty dollars, and that was the deciding factor on this purchase versus a different brand. I notice the price fluctuates wildly on Amazon, so watch for a good deal.\n\nCons: As mentioned by another reviewer, there is a small area of resonance in the body of this thing, whereby if you tap it with your pick while strumming or picking, it will produce a very loud tapping sound. This doesn't happen across the entire length, it's mostly under the G and B strings, perhaps not coincidentally where the cord enters the body. I alleviated that to my satisfaction by making sure I seated it as deep into the soundhole as possible, and pushing it back toward the bridge, as my playing is usually to the front of the soundhole.\n\nThis thing comes with a 1\/4\" all-metal plug, of a type I have never seen before. When I first plugged it in, the connection was intermittent, and it took some wiggling to get consistent sound. I wanted to investigate this initial intermittent connection, so I loosened the set screw on the metal housing and gave the cord a very slight tug. The cord completely disconnected itself from the housing, and I saw that the end of the cord appeared to be cut off clean at the attachment point of tip and ring. So it looks like another reviewer's note that the cord is stiff and lacking stress relief is very valid. I intend to modify this cord anyway, shortening it and attaching a female jack, so no big deal for me. I was able to make a quick and dirty repair so the pickup is useful until I gather the parts I need to make the mod.\n\nToo late to make a long story short, but be aware that the plug is cheesy and apparently less than adequate care is taken on assembly.","summary":"Good Item, With Drawbacks","unixReviewTime":1311984000,"vote":"19","style":{"Style:":" Pro Mag Grand"},"image":null}

Fisher","reviewText":"Just wanted to warn anyone that is considering buying this pickup, or any other pickup.\nFirst, Check that your guitar will support the pickup. This pickup, for example, is a magnetic pickup. That means that you must have all metal strings in order to use it. It will only work with Acoustic guitars with all metal strings. It will not work with a classical, or nylon string guitar. That would be a different type of pickup. They are available for nylon string guitars, but this is not one of them.\n\nSecond, Check the opening of your guitar. The sound hole in the guitar should be large enough to support this pickup from being inserted. If you sound hole is a little smaller than the width of this product. You may be okay. I would not risk more than a quarter, 1\/4, of an inch shorter on each side. Otherwise you will be required to modify the length of the pickup by shaving down the housing. This is a destructive process and can damage the pickup. So be sure that it will fit.\n\nHave other equipment. You have decided to buy this pickup, that is fine. Do you have an amp? This pickup will help to hear the guitar, but an amp is still required. This pickup will also NOT work with a recording device, or computer. You must have a preamp for that functionality, or mixing board that performs amplification.\n\nI cannot state if this pickup is any good. I got mine and it did not work. I tried it on my Honer acoustic guitar, and on my classical. That is how I found out that there were different types of pickups. I thought that if it did not work on one guitar I might use it on another. It still did not work. I tried it out on an amp and on the computer. Neither worked.\n\nThen when I contacted Amazon about a return they said it was my fault and said I may not get all my refund back. What a load of garbage. I am still waiting to find out if they will give me back the whole amount.\n\nI also had problems fitting it in another guitar I own. The sound hole was a little small and Dean Markely stated that I had to cut the ends off of one side of the pickup. That was the only way to get it to fit. They also informed me to be careful doing it because I could damage it. That is when I said No way and returned it. I don't perform surgery on my equipment. I spend too much money on equipment to rig something. I want something that works right when I buy it. I have been a long time buyer on Amazon. Since the 90's. I have had some really bad purchases in the last couple months. I hope that Amazon is not going the way of the Ebay, or Craigslist.

It's OK but not great. The foam is a good color of black (not too grey, blue, or purple but a true black). The foam is a good texture if that word describes the open cell nature in that it's not overly rough as in holes too big to be a rough texture but it's not smooth like closed cell foam. It's a good balance between those two extremes. The fit on an SM58 is fair. It moves around a bit rotating on the wire mesh windscreen and as a result is often askew or slightly tilted and not straight on. (If crooked pictures hanging on walls bugs you this may be a constant bother.) Then, at the bottom, the skirt doesn't taper to the mic body very cleanly and just kinda hangs in mid-air around the mic body as if it doesn't know where to go. The over-all look then becomes a bit awkward and unpolished to the mic. It would be better if the bottom of the foam were sculptured to angle in and taper off more. As to discoloration of the sound, I do sound for TV and can hear a bit (just a bit) of muddy tone with the windscreen on vs with it off, but only with headphones. When used with my QSC system there's no detectable difference on or off the mic over the PA to my ear. As to effectiveness, yes, it blocks wind including breath pops for a tangible difference with it on the mic. So overall it's a good purchase just with a few limitations. It's cheap though. I'm constantly amazed at how costly windscreens can be especially name brand ones made for specific models of mics.

Mine came with a black microfiber cloth, as another reviewer mentioned. The cloth is excellent, doesn't leave fibers behind. Quality seems good. I can't speak for the yellow cloth, but I would imagine you may want to avoid it.\n\nIt does do what it's supposed to well. Removes smudges and leaves a nice, shiny luster. HOWEVER...as another reviewer mentioned it does have a pretty wide spray, so unless you want to soak your pickups and hardware in chemicals (which I certainly don't), you need to angle the spray bottle at a steep angle away from the center, which means you may waste a fair amount. I decided to just spray the cloth itself, which still works, but isn't quite as effective.\n\nHUGE GRIPE: the spray bottle I got dribbles all over the place! On my first spray, I didn't get a spray at all, but rather a huge puddle of polish on my guitar's body. Fortunately I was holding the guitar horizontally and it landed on the body and I had a paper towel within arm's reach. If all that had landed in my hardware or pickups, I'd have been P.O.ed. It didn't seem to dribble quite as bad after that, but it does still dribble. I suspect it's probably just something that slipped through quality control, but jeez....TAKE NOTE AND BE CAREFUL ON YOUR FIRST USE!\n\nAs yet another reviewer mentioned, it says nothing about whether it's safe on all finishes. On poly (most common finishes) it's fine, but if you have a vintage guitar or other guitar with a nitrocellulose or other finish, you may want to check with the manufacturer.\n\nIf it weren't for the dribbling bottle, I'd give it 4-4.5 stars.

This surprised me as these are supposed to have a \"softer, more mellow\" tone (which is why I bought these)\n* The trebles of course seem no different than any treble of similar measure.\n* Since silk & steel traditionally doesn't wear as long or as well as phosphor bronze, aside from the price I see no advantage to this type of string.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:  I like how the strings come two-to-a-paper.  The E is packed with g, A with b, D with e.  At first glance one thinks \"that's cheap\" however, it's smart marketing for several reasons:\n1) It reduces cost of production so allows to keep retail costs as low as possible (it does cost something to make and print those sleeves)\n2) It saves trees.  One would not believe how much wood is saved by simple, small conservation steps.  I remember a report from Celestial Tea which stated that annually they save something like 1 million trees by not putting paper tags on their teabags.  One never thinks about tiny things like that, but if we're going to save forests we need to reduce the use of paper however we can.\n\nSo 5 stars on conservation, but a \"they're okay\" on the strings themselves.  They're by no means a \"bad\" string; rather good in fact.  They just don't live up to the \"silk & steel\" claims I read before deciding to try out this type of string.  I'm probably going to be back with phosphor bronze before long.  The low price however might seem attractive for students up front, but the low wear-time in the long run might not prove satisfactory, as from what I've heard these strings need to be replaced about twice as often as standard strings.\n\nThey're worth trying to see if you like the sound better.  These are just my personal observations.  Overall a good string; they just didn't strike me as \"a reason to switch to silk & steel\" on a permanent basis","summary":"Good strings but not a reason to switch","unixReviewTime":1385164800,"vote":"6","style":{"Size:":" 1 Pack"},"image":null}

The filter doesnt have enough of an impact on the pedal to provide a truly large range from fuzz to metal distortion. Compared to other distortion pedals, it really fails in this regard. However, if used as a fuzz pedal instead, it truly shines, since this is really what it is. Does it have distortion? Yes. Is it valuable as such? Not in my opinion. It isn't condensed enough to be used strictly as that. Another gripe I have is the 9 volt slot. Most pedals use a universal design which allows you to use almost any power supply. Not so with this pedal. You are pretty much relegated to their own adapter or batteries, which sux IMO, especially since I run all my pedals off an adapter chain.\nAnyways, while this is fun to play with, you should definitely consider the sound you are going for. If you prefer to play a more grungy or 70's era metal, then this will work for you. For more crisp sound, you should look elsewhere.

Good tone, good volume, and minimal slipping even shortly after changing the strings.  I don't get much string noise when I slide my fingers during glissando.  Definitely some of the nicest E, A, and D strings that I've had opportunity to play.  I tuned up an extra half step for a few hours and the strings stabilized very quickly (within 4 hours), especially the lower strings.\n\nThe not so good: I am underwhelmed by the volume and tone of the upper B and E strings.  The projection feels weaker than other strings I have used and the tone is very distinct from the lower strings.  They aren't bad strings at all, but I prefer other brands, specifically Augustine Gold Label.\n\nThe interesting: The composite G string is pretty good.  With nice tone and decent volume the G string blends in very nicely with the lower three strings.  The drawback is that it doesn't blend in as neatly with the high E and B strings.\n\nAll in all, these strings do sound pretty good, but every guitar is different.  Unfortunately for D'Addario I have found other strings that I think work better for my guitar (Augustines).  If you're unsure of what strings to buy, I suggest trying several brands to compare against.  I would definitely recommend that you at least give these a shot.","summary":"Not bad, but not my favorite either.

This is made in China....it sounds and feels like it was made in China. It has a very difficult time staying in tune - and that's not because of the Bigsby tailpiece alone. The neck feels flimsy to me....Its a 'D' styled neck, not too wide but kind of thick. It's set neck, not a bolt on and these would normally be quite stable, but it doesn't seem so to me. If you handle the neck even slightly rough - suppose your really getting into a lick or playing a tough series of chords so you grasp the neck strongly while doing so, the thing can get out of tune...it can not take it. I have quite a few other guitars and this seems to be a problem with Epiphones in general (I had an Epiphone Les Paul Traditional Pro that had the same problem - but this is not a problem with the other guitars I own - Yamaha, Gibson, Fender and Aria). I like the P90 pickups...not bad for this style guitar. The workmanship is average - typical Chinese quality - okay if you don't look too close.  The upper master volume knob doesn't seem to have much of any effect and all the knobs are misaligned and on somewhat crooked. The placement of the Bigsby can interfere with adjustment of the volume and tone controls, but they don't seem to really have the same dynamic range of tonal effect you'd expect anyway. Overall, if this didn't look as nice as it does, I wouldn't care for this much at all, but Epiphone has put together a very beautiful looking guitar that sounds ...well, okay.....so for the price, it's a decent buy. If this were to be your only guitar and all you had to spend was $400, I'd tell you to buy something else..like an Ibanez  - but for a 2nd or 3rd...4th or 5th guitar, this is okay and looks great hanging on the wall....and doesn't sound terrible...just okay","summary":"It's a $400 guitar...and it sounds and plays like one....but it looks great","unixReviewTime":1399939200,"vote":"5","style":null,"image":null}

So I bought these because of the name.\nThe packaging is very good quality, as are the strings. However, I found the E string to be too fat for my short-scale bass and the lower notes (E through A) were very dull and lifeless. I can't say I get a snappy tone out of the other strings either.

The pedal works well enough if you are using a passive instrument and the pedal output is plugged into a high impedance input (most pedals are low impedance). The maker of the original pot no longer makes the same audio taper version. Ernie Ball uses as close to the correct taper as they can find, but it's not the same as the original version. I soldered a 4.02kohm across the end connections of the pot (any value near it would work as well), but that only shifts the complete pedal movement to change the volume to go from half to full volume. It won't completely turn down the volume. That works OK for me. With this mod the pedal movement seems to correspond to the volume change. I'm using active instruments & send the pedal to a line of effects pedals. If you don't want to deal with this, buy a pedal with input and output buffer circuits.

If you are new to playing the mandolin, as I am, this can be extremely confusing. It is not intuitive or straight forward. I had to Google to try and figure out how to attach it and at that point, I discovered that the cord necessary to attach the strap was missing. It's just a simple braided cord and I was able to substitute a cord-style shoestring so it wasn't a huge issue but still, if I hadn't Googled a lot, I would have been left scratching my head. (I notice I am not the only reviewer who received a strap that was missing the necessary cord.)\n\nThe strap itself is very nice and soft and comfortable. It is NOT natural leather. It is labeled Eco Leather and is synthetic leather. That is not a drawback for me but if you're wanting real leather, this isn't it. It also has a round, embroidered logo on the strap that says NYXL. It's orange and white and I kind of wish it wasn't there but I didn't deduct stars for this.\n\nEven though the strap is very nice, I am deducting 2 stars for the lack of instructions and the missing cord. D'Addario is a long established and well recognized company offering high quality musical accessories so the lack of instructions and poor quality control (the missing cord) surprises and disappoints me.

First thing I'll say here is that I have trouble getting a guitar in tune. But I do know when a guitar goes out of tune, and these strings do not stay in tune. My teacher, a fine player and a wonderful person, liked these, but he is an extremely quick \"tuner\" and I have seen him make micro-adjustments frequently between songs and even during songs. I can't do that. Tuning for me is slow and laborious and done with a tuner or a Gieson online string to match pitch.\n\nNow, I would have said all the above years ago but never wrote a review. Here's why: Many years ago, I switched to Hannabach Goldin strings, which do stay in tune, and which sound much better than any D'Addario string. However, I recently did not have much money and bought a pack of these D'Addario strings. They were just awful. It took a week for them to settle down and stay in tune.\n\nAs soon as I get some more cash, I am returning to the Hannabach Goldin strings. But I would admit that the cost is massively higher.\n\nI also think Savarez strings are better than the D'Addarios, but, again, Hannabach Goldin is so far beyond both that if you can afford it, I would strongly suggest switching.","summary":"Don't stay in tune but are priced low","unixReviewTime":1371600000,"vote":null,"style":{"Size:":" Hard Tension","Style:":" 1-Pack"},"image":null}

I work in a busy repair shop and string several hundred guitars per year, so many, that I use a custom 600RPM string winder. I use Daddario strings on all my customer's instruments and also on my own. Daddario strings, including these EXL-110s, have been the most consistent and advanced strings I have ever worked with.\n\nI have a gripe though..... The packaging these \"bulk\" strings come in needs a serious redesign, more specifically the individual tubes that hold the strings inside the box. Often, when you pull a string out like the directions explain, more than one string tries to come out and jams the one you're pulling on. If you then pull any harder to free it, you sometimes damage one or both strings. I've needed vice grips to pull stuck \/ destroyed strings out. What's worse is, I sell these strings in full sets, so if one gets damaged, I lose a whole set, which ruins the reason to buy in bulk. This is not good!\n\nDaddario knows about this problem and as far as I know, has refused to redesign it. Furthermore, when I've talked to them to explain this problem (several times now) they tell me to ship the entire box back so they can \"determine\" if there's a problem. Sorry, that's not gonna happen Daddario. They are quite rude. I ask any of you who have had this problem to YELL at Daddario about this and refer to this review!\n\nI have absolutely no problem with Daddario's individual packaged sets of strings. In fact, that packaging is as brilliant as their strings are. They use color-coded ball ends to tell you which string is which and they are in a hermetically sealed plastic bag that out-gasses a corrosion inhibitor, thus, giving you a set of strings that are as fresh as the day they were made.\n\nHope this helps.

This is easy:  Fill the sponge with water, ring it out and place it between the string of guitar (has small hooks to catch strings so it stays in place).\nThen, ALWAYS, place the guitar into the case.  I used to have all mine on display - not a good idea in a cold Wisconsin winter.  The lack of humidity started drying out the wood on the guitars and I developed \"Fret Buzz\" with a vengeance!\nThe humidifiers are quite useless if not kept in a case as the sponge dries out quickly.  When in the case, the sponge will last a couple of days - then, need to be re-moistened.  If your guitars were in the shape of mine, this is not a quick fix.

(I actually bought three of them.)\n\nI crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and A\/C in the summer, keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet. The humidity drops quite low, but the sponges remain moist for several days before I can no longer fight the urge to re-wet them. lol.\n\nTwo great tips in one:\nUse a regular, more dense sponge, thicker like the ones at the dollar store. Cut them to size and stuff them in!\nThrow away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and don't worry about distilled water, unless you want to. I can't argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets, but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size, and toss them away without any regard when needing replaced.\n\nDon't worry about the \"thing\" hanging in-between your strings. It will not damage anything unless you get the sponge  too saturated and it leaks. I will either squeeze the excess water out, or shake the container with the sponge inside until I am satisfied that it won't drip.\n\nThe humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundhole.\n\nIf you ARE rough, careless, thoughtless, or stupid, you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out, but I would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen. This would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could cause.\n\nThe top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover. The sponge inside is quite small, and there isn't too much room for a much larger sponge. The device is simple and fairly solid. Treat it gently and it will last forever. You can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher. If you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills, I'm sure it would be a decade before anything \"built up\" to require extensive cleaning or replacement.\n\nKeep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be re-wetting the sponge.\nTry to keep the sponge moist when it's dry.\n\nI strongly suggest getting an Oasis case humidifier, (or similar) mini sized about 1\" X 4\" costing around 17-20 bucks.\nThis will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument case.\n\nRemember, too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp. Too dry and it will shrink and crack, split the soundboard (top) also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive!\n\nIf you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and\/or dry, you would be negligent (if not careless) to spend the pittance to make sure your 'baby ain't thirsty', or worse...dead & broken!\n\nHope this helps!","summary":"Works Fine & Much Better Than Nothing!","unixReviewTime":1390262400,"vote":"5","style":{"Style:":" Humidifier"},"image":null}

I own 2 nice Taylor guitars that need humidification and I've tried various devices to accomplish this.  Oasis was a mess and ultimately the crystals quit working or fell out or who knows what.  I've also used the classic Damp-It which seems to dry out faster and would get mineral residue on the sponge causing it to get hard and be non-functional unless using distilled water.  The sponge on the Planet Waves is easily replaced by trimming a kitchen sponge and I like that it hangs between strings and never touches the wood.

It would not work for an f-hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele.  Inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge.  If you use distilled water (as recommended) it should last quite a while.  The top comes off with a gentle press on the sides.  The dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly.  Don't push it all the way in after moistening and you won't have a problem.  I drip a little distilled water on the sponge, squeeze out any excess, and the assembled case pops in easily between the D and G strings, suspended in the middle of the sound hole.  They can't be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings.  I've never had one of these move from where I left it.\n\nIf the sponge isn't dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case.  When the humidity is very low (30% or less) the sponge dries out in 2 to 3 days even if the case isn't opened.  As with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days.\n\nIf you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar (or don't want to see one) use a guitar humidifier!  Especially during the winter - heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels (between 45% and 60% is ideal for most guitars).  Air conditioning can do the same.  For especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitar(s) is okay.  For many reasons it's always best to keep your guitar in a case or gig bag when not in use.  A humidifier is inexpensive extra precaution at those times of year when temperature or humidity changes quickly.","summary":"A Good Basic Humidifier for Round Hole Acoustic Guitars","unixReviewTime":1295913600,"vote":"48","style":{"Style:":" Humidifier"},"image":null}

Having all the tension rods at about the same tension makes doing the final tuning MUCH easier.  That said, you need to be careful using this key, and there's a trick that may help you.\nHere's what I do.\nAfter you put a new head on, tighten all the rods until they just touch the hoop.\nThen finger tighten them all about the same amount.\nNow start with the torque key at a very low level, and go around the lugs at least twice in your normal tuning pattern.\n\nTighten the key, and repeat.  Do this until you get close to the pitch you want, going around your lug pattern at least twice at each tension.\n\nAnd here's the trick.  Once you are close to pitch, because static friction is greater than dynamic friction, it helps if you loosen the tension rod 1\/16 or 1\/8 of a turn before tightening them.  If you do this, breaking the friction before tightening, you'll find that all of a sudden one or two rods will turn another 1\/8 or 1\/4 of turn, and suddenly all the others will move a little more to.  Using that trick, this little toy can get each lug to within 1 or 2 Hz of each other while you watch music videos, sports, or your favorite TV show.\n\nAll that is left is to fine tune a little bit, but you'll probably have to turn of the TV for that part.  One more thing, like another reviewer said, if you have rusty or dirty threads on the tension rods, all bets are off, because it will take more torque to get the same tension on the rods.","summary":"There is a trick to using this key","unixReviewTime":1362960000,"vote":"17","style":{"Color:":" Original Version"},"image":null}

It will NOT tune your drums for you nor is it in any way a substitute for traditional tuning.  What it will do is FACILITATE your tuning efforts.\n\nFirst, and foremost, and this is mandatory.  You MUST lubricate your lugs.  I use Lug Lube but any lightweight non-graphite oil will work.  If you fail to do this then this tool is of less value since any rusty or sticky lugs will have more resistance than others, defeating the purpose of the tool.\nSecond, the tool is NOT precise.  It does however get you close very quickly.  It makes for a quick starting point.  It's precision is much better IMO for higher tension uses than low tension ones.  Hence, it does a better job on snares and smaller toms than it does bigger ones.

I haven't taken it on any long journeys, but for lugging it around town and in the car, it gets the job done. Here are a few things I like\/ dislike about the case I received:\n\nPros-\n-The case will fit your guitar very snugly. My Telecaster fits firmly in place, the headstock brushes up against the top of the case and the body brushes up against the bottom. There is also little wiggle room horizontally if you plan on standing the case up. The plush is surprisingly soft for the price.\n\n-It's stackable. If you own multiple guitars and are tight on space, the groove on the bottom of the case fits inside the one on the top.\n\n-There is plenty of space inside the case. I've got a strap, a set of spare strings, a cable, earplugs, picks, a tuner, etc. all comfortably fit in the two compartments. There's also room by the headstock if you need extra space.\n\n-It's tough enough to get you most places. I wouldn't necessarily recommend stowing it on a plane or in a cargo bay, but under your watch, and with care, this case offers protection as well as any other one does on the road.\n\nCons-\n-Craftsmanship is a bit of an issue with the case, or at least the one I received. The outside of the case feels a bit cheaply made. Whenever I close it, I have to pull (with some force) on the lid to make sure it aligns properly with the bottom. Otherwise it jams up when it latches. Not a huge complaint, as it's pretty easy to live with, but it's worthy of knocking a star off.\n\n-Not as much body contour and neck support as you would get with a brand name case. My Fender hard shell case, for example, is softer plush and carved exactly to fit my Fender P Bass. Since this case is half the cost of brand name cases, however, and doesn't advertise to fit any guitar specifically, it doesn't have to.\n\n-Doesn't fit all electric guitars. If you have a guitar with a very wide body, for example, my friend's Gretsch hollow body is too wide for this case. Be careful and measure your guitar or try one out before you spend the money.\n\nIn all, this is a cheap case that is very good value for money. It's a little short, and fits most electric guitars snugly. Although there are some minor issues with quality, I know that my Telecaster is well protected by this case and I trust it enough to carry around and haul in the car.","summary":"Great protection for most guitars, for the money.","unixReviewTime":1358467200,"vote":"8","style":{"Style:":" Electric"},"image":null}

There is a name tag plate near the handle.\n-The foam is very stiff on the inside; think styrofoam rather than sofa cushion. There is a softer padded area which contacts the bridge\/string area. Everything is covered in a fairly thin feeling plush fuzzy material.\n-There are two 14\" long storage compartments, one on either side of the neck. There are no lids for the compartments except for when you close the case.\n-The open rectangular body cavity is 13-5\/8\" wide by 20.5\" long on the bass side and 21\" long on the treble side (there is a step at the lower bout area).\n-The headstock area is full width and 10.5\" long. It goes deeper than the main body area to allow for angled back headstocks.\n-The maximum length inside is 47.5\"\n\nOverall the quality seems pretty nice, at least as nice as any wooden case I have, and should protect as well or better.

However, purchased at Amazon's price (among others), I think it's a fair cost:  The foam itself is probably worth $6-7, if one can find the same product locally.  (Most upholstery foam, even if the right density, is white or yellow.)  Then comes the tricky part:  cutting the foam evenly, with the slight angle to position the speakers properly.  Maybe your hands are incredibly steady, and your cutting tools are razor sharp.  Maybe you can measure the angles perfectly, and make identical repeat cuts on each piece.  Or maybe you don't care if they don't look perfect, and wobble a little until they settle in.  Me, I'm not that steady, and I'm willing to pay a little more for good looks and precision.

It has a warm sound, not too bright.  I mostly notice some hum if my guitar and pickup are near my laptop.\n\nFishman has compensated for the differences in the magnetic properties in the wound strings vs. the plain steel strings - volume is well balanced from string to string.  All the ways to amplify an acoustic have pluses and minuses attached.  This pickup seems pretty immune to feedback and does not pick up much of the handling noise or a click if you hit the guitar with a pick.  A magnetic pickup will provide a pretty steady amount of volume, as opposed to a mic that you need to stay near to be heard.  That being said, if you want to record your performance, most mics will sound more natural.  ( Note: I got my pickup used from a guy who got a guitar with built in pickups, so I think it will hold up well under normal use, with a little attention to care.)\n\nUpdate -  as of October 2016.  I have used this on two gigs and a number of open mics, and its been great.  I actually added a tailpiece jack (last year) and have the pickup semi-permanently mounted in my guitar.  String to string balance is pretty good, and no feedback issues at open mics or gigs.

The sound, when installed on several of my guitars, is quite mellow and sounds a lot like the guitars themselves only louder -- all except the B string.  With both phosphor bronze and 80\/20 light strings, on the three acoustics I tested it with, the piercing volume and tone of the B string makes the pickup unusable for flat picking and less-than-perfect for finger style.  I could work with it for finger style, but I'd have to take the B string off the guitar to use this pickup for flat picking or strumming.  It's that unbalanced (for my style, guitar, and string combination).\n\nI love how it installs and how it virtually disappears when installed.  The price isn't bad.  The pickup is dead quiet, with respect to hum or other noise.  Overall, I'd buy a couple if there was a way to tame the B string.  By the way I found that a Seymour Duncan Woody Humbucker with adjustable pole pieces worked out better for me at a third less cost, but I do prefer the way the Fishman Neo-D installs.

I also have a K & K pure mini and this is much better at accurately reproducing the acoustic sound of the guitar, but I needed something to go into an amp that wouldn't feedback so humbucker it was. If you're looking to really get a great acoustic guitar sound I would recommend going for a bridge or mic pickup instead. I did test this up against a Seymour Duncan Woody and this thing blows that out of the water, at least on my guitar.\n\nThe only thing I would change is to make the cord removable. Because it's permanently attached to the pickup and the pickup screws into place with a philips head screwdriver, it that means that either you always have a cord hanging off your guitar, or you have to carry a screwdriver with you and unscrew the pickup to remove it when you're not using it. I ended up clipping the cord and inserting my own jack mid-line which works fine but it would be preferable to just have some sort of jack built into the pickup itself. On another note, it's recommended for the sake of the finish on the guitar not to leave it on all the time, so maybe they should just change the way that it installs so that you don't need a screwdriver.\n\nOn that note, maybe they could make it adjustable too because when I first installed the pickup it was too high and was hitting the strings so I had to take a razor blade and slice off about half of the cork on the top side to get it down far enough that my strings wouldn't come in contact with it.  I have a luthier guitar though so this might not be an issue for a factory instrument.\n\nSo I guess, it does it's job well enough though you may have to do some custom mods to make it work for you.","summary":"Not too shabby, once you modify it.","unixReviewTime":1429747200,"vote":"3","style":{"Style:":" Humbucking"},"image":null}

It seems to be a well made instrument, so let's jump to the chase.  I spent an afternoon doing A\/B comparisons between the SM48 ($30), my nearly-new SM58 ($100), and a nearly-new Chinese SM58 knock-off (Digital Reference DRV-100), which I bought on sale for $10.  I compared the three mikes through my P.A. system, with the equalizer flat and reverb settings they way I like them for the SM58, without trying to optimize them for each microphone (seemed like too much work).  In addition, I was using the P.A. line out to my Sony MDR-7506 Sound Monitor Headphones, rather than the P.A. speakers, to allow more critical listening.  For my voice, P.A., and settings, I found both Shure microphones to be quite usable for a live performance, but the DRV-100 was a distant third for vocal quality.\n\nAfter many comparisons over the course of an afternoon, I found that I do prefer the sound of the SM58 enough that I will continue to use it as my live performance vocal microphone, especially since I already own it, but I would not feel  particularly inconvenienced if I had to use the SM48.  There are differences in the way they sound, but I'm not sure they would be noticeable, to the average listener, out of the P.A. speakers in a live show.  I'm pretty sure that would not be the case for the DRV-100.\n\nI then compared the two cheaper microphones, through the same setup, when used as instrument microphones for my 60's era Martin 000-18.  Again, there was a lot of difference in the sound.  The higher efficiency of the DRV-100 required a gain adjustment each time I swapped instruments, but I kept the equalizer flat.  So far I somewhat prefer the DRV-100 as an guitar microphone, probably because I prefer a brighter sound for finger-style work and the SM48 may prove to be fine for instrument use once I fool around with the equalizer.\n\nIn summary, if it proves to be durable, the SM48-LC is a lot of microphone for the money.  It demonstrates the way of the electronic world: you can get a lot of quality for not very much money and you may have to pay a lot more to get something even a little bit better.","summary":"Great microphone for the price, but not a SM58 at 70% off (if that's what you were thinking)","unixReviewTime":1416182400,"vote":"74","style":{"style:":" Without On\/Off Switch"},"image":null}

While it is a pretty nice, warm, smooth and versatile mic...it seemed to lack the fullness I had hoped for.  Perhaps it was the Zoom R24 Multrack I was plugged into, I'm not sure.  But when I ran the Rode through this pre-amp, suddenly the full sound I was looking for was all there with room to spare.  There is a little hiss with the TubePRE stock tube depending on how much you saturate it, but I dropped in a Tungsol 12AX7 replacement tube which is less than 15 bucks.  The sound is now extremely smooth, warm, rich, full & quite.  I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for having to replace the tube.  In hindsight, I wished I would have spent a little more and got the 2-channel version of this pre-amp, the Blue Tube DP.  No worries, I'll have one of each.","summary":"Hard To Beat If Coupled w\/ A Tungsol Tube Upgrade (15 bucks)","unixReviewTime":1320192000,"vote":"6","style":null,"image":null}

Good overall sound quality. Fairly realistic. Does not change your basic tone.\n\n2. Increasing the reverb effect does not attenuate your direct signal.\n\n3. The reverb trails off when disengaged.\n\n4. Solid Boss reliability.\n\nCons:\n\n1. When switching between reverb types, it requires radical, tweaky-tweaking of the time and tone parameters to dial in a realistic effect. This makes it very difficult to switch between types during a live gig.\n\n2. The modulation reverb is cool for a far out, atmospheric space noise thing and can generate a cool feedback effect, but the chorus is very subtle and not warm or analog sounding like what you get in the MXR Carbon Copy, more high-tech sounding.\n\n3. Having a \"gate\" reverb for guitar is a waste of space. I'd much rather have a different sounding room or hall, or a \"reverse\" effect. That would've been way cooler.\n\nHere is my list of the most realistic settings.

The clip isn't the strongest but it holds and can also be used with a pencil condenser. Admittedly it did take some work to find a desired sound. It takes a good bit of equalizing and placement to get it just right. I have mine mounted inside the bass drum using L brackets connected to the lug screws, a few bungee cords and a tom bracket plate(There are youtube videos showing various ways to do this). This puts the mic very close to the batter head to capture the midrange punch with the inside resonance. A subkick placed in front of the resonant head makes it sound like a pro kick! It also works very well on bass guitar cabs. If you're willing to put forth the effort or just starting out with project recordings this is a smart buy. The price is actually what pushes it from a 3 to a 4 star. If you're looking for something plug and play with little to no eq, look to spend a couple hundred more. I will be upgrading soon and moving this to the floor tom as it works even better for them. Get one as a back-up for your live mic as well.

This amplifier seems, though, to hold a charge nicely and would therefore seem to be the ideal amplifier to take along to any al fresco situation.  My 4 star review is bassed (spelling intentional) on the fact that it has a \"5\" tone for clean-tone electric guitar, but is more of a \"3\" for electric bass.  Mine seems to have an inherent buzz on F (10th fret, G string, electric bass).  The speaker looks fine, the screws are all tight, but there's a buzz.  I have tried three different basses and the buzz is most annoying on a short-scale bass, but it is noticeable on all three.  Cutting the treble and mid-range and boosting the bass on the amplifier helps quite a bit, but still this amplifier clearly emphasizes the upper harmonics.  At some point, it might be interesting to see what a larger speaker would do, although several non-Amazon reviews that I've read suggest that the relatively small (for a bass amp) speaker might not entirely be the culprit.  I would recommend the Pignose Hog 30 without question for guitarists (the buzz is not really noticeable on guitar, so it does seem to be connected somehow to the harmonic series (overtones) of the bass.  It is a crisp guitar amp and with effects pedals will do just about anything you'd need for practicing or for a small outdoor gig.  With a classical acoustic\/electric, it is also quite nice, especially for the price.  On bass, it's just more fussy.  I did connect through an emulator pedal that changes the overtones and the tone was better; however, ideally an amplifier should not require the use of an effects pedal.  It is not a bad bass amp, provided that the music you are playing avoids the resonating frequency and the notes adjacent to it.  Since I play both bass and guitar, I am happy with the amp, and will use it for both.  If I only played bass, however, I might be looking for another battery powered amp.","summary":"Five Stars for Guitar; Three for Bass","unixReviewTime":1288742400,"vote":"19","style":null,"image":null}

From what I've researched, these vibrations can cause stress in your hands and\/or arms depending on your technique and hit, and that's something to think about if you have had drum related injuries in the past or want to try avoiding an injury.  So the fact that these sticks really do decrease the vibrations is awesome because your hands absorb much less of the strain from each hit which in theory would lessen your chances of wrist or arm injuries or help those who have these injuries play drums.  This aspect of the stick is the reason why it gets the 4 starts.\n\nThe reason why I deducted a star is because the stick just not comfortable to hold and play with.  There seems to be rubber running through the inside of the stick which would explain why it feels heavy and unbalanced throughout the whole stick. The finish and bead and shaft are great; but I can't play comfortably with the anti-vibe sticks and it's not as much fun to drum with sticks that don't feel \"good\".

Jackson","reviewText":"The material seems cheap, I am worried that any tiny little thing is going to scratch or mar the knobs, or heaven forbid, something might hit them the wrong way and they may just shatter. However, the acrylic is perfectly clear, the numbers are easily legible, and the grip is good, so cheap feeling is a relatively minor gripe. My biggest complaint is that the knurling on the inside of the knob doesn't seem to match the knurling on any potentiometer anywhere, so it's extremely difficult to get them ON to begin with. As much as I was terrified of cracking and breaking them getting them on, I couldn't get them flat and flush without taking a rubber mallet to the tops, which also made me worry about damaging the equally-expensive pots they were mounting to. And that creates the new problem of \"I have no idea how I'm going to get them back off if I ever need to because they're stuck on so tight.\"\n\nThat hasn't stopped me from putting them on in place of the weird rippled barrels that came on my SG, and in place of the even more awful Fender-style top hats on my Telecaster thinline. I'm just glad that they don't say \"volume\" and \"tone\" on them. I'm not a huge fan of labeling something that's obvious, because to me it just looks tacky. I've bought several sets of these already and probably will end up buying more eventually, so I guess that's a good testimonial.

{"overall":4,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"02 15, 2014","reviewerID":"A1TCG8ZFPCPZVW","asin":"B0002D0N7K","reviewerName":"Jason","reviewText":"I want to make two things clear up front.  1:  I am not a professional studio engineer, but I am a serious recording hobbyist who takes the art of engineering & recording as seriously as at the art of music itself.  2:  I fully realize the subjective parts of mic reviews and will avoid as many cliche's as I can.  Okay I'll keep this short, so lets go.\n\nOne thing I always remind people of with microphones is how important it is to realize the facts and golden rules of microphones.  For instance, one person's garbage mic is another gold standard go-to mic.  Also, what determines the class a mic sits in (beginner, intermediate, pro) is entirely misguided as those identifiers are almost entirely referring to the price point.  That's why everyone calls a $100 mic a budget mic and a $1000+ mic a pro mic.  The only other thing that determines pro from budget is how a company stands behind their engineering.  If you can send your mic in to the manufacturer and get a capsule replaced or otherwise have the mic repaired and sent back, I would say that partly qualifies a mic as pro level.  I could care less if a mic costs 20 bucks, if the company stands behind their product and I like the characteristics of the mic then it could be a \"pro's\" mic (the engineering isn't that complicated, just expensive to do).  The only way this could be disputed is that some higher end microphones are engineered exceedingly well to be absolutely neutral and don't contain sonic characteristics that otherwise color the neutral sound.  Anyways...\n\nI have two of these microphones in my kit.  I generally only pull them out for room miking or for stereo spread miking in applications where I want to capture the transients better.  I generally do not use these alone on an instrument, they are usually always blended in with other mikes that are covering the same instrument from another place.\n\nThe key to being a good engineer is identifying the limitations of your equipment and knowing how to work around them, or at least knowing what the best mic is for the desired application.  This microphone in question is a small diaphragm cardioid condenser, so what does that tell us?  Typically small diaphragm mics are better at reacting to transients (sharp fast sounds) and since its a condenser it will have a better dynamic range (with volume and pickup) than say a dynamic or non-active ribbon mic.  They are also the lipstick style body designs so that means they can be placed almost anywhere because of their small size and simple design (compared to a clunky heavy tube LDC mic).\n\nSome limitations are:\n\n1.  You can't switch between polar patterns (no figure 8 or omni), but that's common here.  You wouldn't be using this design of a mic for omni or figure 8 uses anyways.\n\n2.  Its made at a lower price point so that means lower quality parts and workmanship or quality control.  Though this is an unproven assumption, its easy to infer that if you don't treat the mic with great care, it could break very easily.  Also, I haven't checked, but does anyone know if CAD will fix or replace one of these if they break under warranty?  Its a hard limitation to defend I know, but all I'm saying is that its a cheaply built mic, otherwise it would cost more.  I do think its a pretty mic with its finish though.  Not ugly by any means.\n\n3.  Just looking at the frequency response graph on their website you can tell this mic has a large presence in the upper mid to high frequency range.  Before hearing the mic you could assume this might result in a harsher brittle sound that would need to be eq'd lightly or even heavily.  I generally take freq response graphs with a grain of salt, but that big of hump in the high ranges is hard to ignore.  I would say its not bad to work with, it is a tad harsh but better that expected for its price point.  When I used it for a stereo pair room mic I was miking a tambourine and shaker (they make sound in that higher range).  I was worried about the eq but all I really had to do was multi-band compress the trouble region and nudge it lower by 2-3 db.  Then I gently applied some pultec eq at 10khz (plugin) until it sat nicely in the mix.  I know not everyone will have these exact tools.  All I can suggest is that you have a warm sounding mic pre to balance the boosted hi-end presence or be prepared to do some eq'ing in the upper range.\n\n4.  This mic has a self noise rating of 17dba.  That would be great for a tube condenser but this is a solid state small diaphragm condenser.  Sure its not astronomically high like some other budget mics, but that's a fairly serious limitation.  What this means is you'll have to be careful with how much gain you're applying in the pre stage.  With a mic like this you'll be much better off miking your subject within a foot or two and no more.  But as I said I've used this mic for a room mic before.  It is fine to do, just realize you need to back off the gain to avoid a high noise floor (which will translate terribly into your recording).  To get around the self noise, watch your gain settings.  If you're going for lo-fi garage rock though, you could easily ignore all that advice.\n\nCan't think of any other specific limitations I didn't cover.  Just make sure you think about that with all your mic's in your kit.  As far as additional recommendations, I'm going to assume (i do this a lot) that you don't have much money to throw around on microphones.  If that is the case I will suggest two paths to take.\n\n1.  Do very thorough research (calling companies and engineers, read reviews, watch youtube videos) and purchase a varied set of the best budget mics (SM57, a pair of CAD GXL1200BP or similar brand, Rode NT1A or similar Large Diaphragm condenser).  Run these budget mics through a decent if not phenomenal mic preamp (tube or FET, whatever you can afford to spend the most on).  Run your budget mics into a decent pre into a decent interface into your DAW, or skip the interface and DAW if you are analog recording.  This way you can clean up the loss of fidelity from the mics with the preamps and even further with EQ.  Unfortunately its inevitable you will need to use EQ and other processing just to get most budget mics to sound good.  Its NOT the end of the world, its how the recording world works sometimes.  In some cases no eq will be necessary, realize that isn't a standard you've created that everyone else should follow, it just happens to suit your ears at the time.  That's what makes microphone research so hard, everyone has a different set of discriminating ears.\n\n2.  The other way to go is to skip the budget mic setup (a pair of Small Diap. Condensers, One LDC, a couple dynamics) and just go for one very good mid-range to high-end LDC (Large Diaphragm Condenser).  This way you save up for only one very good mic, but one that is versatile enough to use on everything.  A good engineer knows how to mic even a drum kit with only one microphone.  If this sounds good to you, what I would suggest is getting the Rode NT1A Oktavamod from Mike Joly Engineering.  Its about $600.  If that is still too high look at vintageking.com for LDC mics in your range and do the research from there (check sweetwater and soundpure.com too).\n\nI know this review is very long winded but I think its best to provide real-world advice instead of just a simple half-brained review that would only serve the purpose to confuse you further and make it worse.  I am a self-taught recording engineer with decent home recording experience and the thirst to learn more to become a great engineer.  I believe in the truth always when it comes to the art of recording because all the rest of the garbage coming out of peoples mouths is just lies most of the time fueled by whatever nonsense is poisoning their brains.  If you have any recording or mic questions leave a comment and maybe I could help you figure your issue out.  Thank you.","summary":"Adequate for its price-point","unixReviewTime":1392422400,"vote":"3","style":{"Color:":" Black Pearl Finish","style:":" GXL1200BP"},"image":null}

I thought I should come back and put some review info in here.\n\nThis is a fine case.  I like it.  I can't yet bring myself to let it go.  The only problem I had with it was its size.  It is physically very big due to the rectangular size.  The location where the shoulder strap connects always bothered me too as I had to unhook one side every time I opened the case.  I will add I replaced the shoulder strap immediately upon its arrival cause the one which came with it was cheap.  Adequate I guess but minimal.\n\nOK, that is most of the negatives.  I still liked it and and used it regularly.  It protected my guitar well (PRS Semi Hollow just fit) and I really liked the inside dual storage boxes on each side of the neck.  I used the outside pouches heavily also.\n\nI replaced it for one reason only, it is big.  Note I didn't say too big cause you might love it.\n\nNow, I've moved to another case with backpack straps.  I miss the shoulder strap a lot and will likely customize the new one to add one soon if I stick with it.\n\nThe two things I miss most about it now are the inside storage which my new case does not have AND the weight.  This thing is so light that you simply get used to it and don't realize how light it is.  Everything else I carry now seems very heavy.\n\nI may go back.  Only time will tell.\n\nFor the price, I think this is an excellent case.  Maybe I'll buy another guitar just so I can justify keeping it ;-)","summary":"Loved it except for size (rectangular size)","unixReviewTime":1341446400,"vote":"10","style":{"Style:":" Electric"},"image":null}

Originally replaced the pickups with uncovered Seymour Duncan SH-1's, though the guitar can with covered pickups.\n\nLiked it for a while (5 years, to be exact), but, having bought a 2012 Gibson LP Standard Plus, and it having burstbucker pro's, I figured I'd show the Epi a bit of love and swap to some covered pickups, and, why not Gibson 57 Cl\/Cl+?\n\nYes, I know, I could have just bought some covers, soldered them on, and potted them myself, but, that's a PITA I didn't want to deal with. These are already potted.\n\nRemoved the SH1's, installed these, and there's a difference - these are a bit 'hotter'. Granted, that could be pickup-string distance differences, but, overall, I still think it was an improvement. No matter, asthetically the Epi looks better, though tonally it can't touch the Gibson.\n\nStill, as a grab it, play the crap out of it and put it away wet, the Epi is a bit more friendly to that kind of treatment, and if i ding it, I won't shed nearly as many tears...hence why I still have it....plus it's a good comparison to what I thought was a pretty good guitar...\n\nI know these aren't Burstbuckers (1\/2\/3) or Burstbucker Pros, BBs are \"scatter-wound\", which I guess means they're wound randomly (but probably the same number of turns), and unevenly wound coils - meaning one coil has more winds than the other, which give the BB's more \"bite\", where the 57 CL\/CL+ would be more \"smooth\/creamy\"\n\n-1 star because they ARE so expensive, even though here they had the best price I could find easily.","summary":"Expensive, but good","unixReviewTime":1349913600,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

Overall, I think it's a good value for the price  I did follow everyone's advise and replaced the strings.  The sound seems okay; however, I'm picking up a little buzz on the first string, third fret while strumming a G chord. I'm hoping it will work itself out as the strings settle.  I will say that I was pleasantly surprised with the action on this guitar.  Right out of the box, the strings are relatively low to the fret board, which is unusual for a low end guitar.  I asked the tech if there was anything he could do to improve its performance.  The stuff he talked about was minor, so there wasn't really any need for a setup.\n\nI would recommend this guitar for someone who is a beginner, or for someone who just wants something that won't break the bank.  Would be a great guitar for camping, beach, or wherever.  No worries.\n\nUPDATE: It turns out that the fourth fret was high.  Not wanting to deal with fixing it, I returned to Guitar Center where they swapped it out for a DR 150.  Now I have a high fourteenth fret on the new guitar.  My advise to anyone who wants to buy one of these guitars is to play all the frets and check for buzz.

He wanted to learn to play. I thought \"Well, if he gives up on it, I'm only out a hundred bucks.\".\nWhen it arrived, I opened the box to make sure it wasn't in pieces before wrapping it. I was blown away. The finish was flawless. The fret ends were nicely dressed. The neck was straight. There was no glue squeezing out from under the bracing. The headstock has an actual inlay instead of a decal.\nIt sounded a little tinny with stock strings, as other reviews here have noted, so I put some Martin 9s on it to ease him into callused fingers. It sounds really good! My own acoustic is a Seagull with a cedar top. The spruce on the Epiphone is a little brighter, but not at all harsh. The neck is surprisingly thin and narrow, which I don't prefer, but is good for smaller hands. It's a lot like an Ibanez electric neck, in fact.\nIt may not project like a more expensive acoustic, but I wasn't at all displeased with its tone, which will only improve with time. If you're looking for a good deal on a beginners acoustic, look no further.\n\nUpdate: A year later, and he DID give up on it. Actually, he never really tried. I took it home, because it was making him feel guilty, just sitting in the corner. It really has good tone, and stays in tune beautifully for stock Epi tuners! A heavier gauge string improves its sound.\nIt won't replace my own acoustic but, as a first guitar, backup for when other players come over, or a campfire guitar, it's a fantastic buy.\n\n4 stars for the quality to price ratio. It's obviously not in the same league as a 600 dollar Takamine, let alone a 2,400 dollar Gibson, but is well worth the 99 bucks I paid for it, and then some.

To my ear, in comparison to more expensive Yamaha soprano recorders, and larger alto and tenor models, the low F on this one is just a tiny bit higher than it should be, another reason for the four stars, but hey, for the price!\nBefore buying this model I asked a question here on Amazon about the colored translucent models, and was told by a consort player that these translucent ones are just as good as the ivory ones, and as I found, and say above, better than some.\nI have been playing recorder for about 15 years and played clarinet for more than a year before that, and I like this okay.\nI sit in my kitchen while dinner is cooking, and have a jam -- I play mostly jazz pop.","summary":"Excellent value, lots of fun even for experienced players","unixReviewTime":1414108800,"vote":"9","style":{"Color:":" Blue","Style:":" YRS-20"},"image":null}

Even better would be a non-binary setting so instead of either off or 100% on it could do different fog amounts.\n\nThat said, I'm sure such features exist in more expensive fog machines, and this is not an expensive fog machine.

For such a low cost mic, they are very versatile with a continuously variable polar pattern that can be dialled up using a knob recessed into the mic body.  They appear to use a K67 style, center terminated capsule.  They're a little bright up top, but not annoyingly so.  I've read that these mics don't excel as vocal mics, but in my own shoot-outs, I think they are up to the task and make perfectly serviceable vocal mics.  These mics do demand a decent phantom power supply, as they use an op-amp based head amp that draws more current than your typical FET based mic, so if you are going to use them with a soundcard that has build-in preamps, make sure it can deliver a full 48V with sufficient current.  The up-side is that the op-amp based electronics are nice and quiet, giving the mic a nice low noise floor, so it's suitable for quiet sources.\n\nMy only real gripe is that the plastic carrying case is ridiculously large, taking up twice the storage space it should and making the mic somewhat expensive to ship.  Other than that, the mic easily earns 4 out of 5 stars for quality and value and usability.  It's a swiss army knife and will find a lot of uses in my studio.","summary":"Very versatile, low self noise.","unixReviewTime":1396915200,"vote":"2","style":{"style:":" Large Diaphragm Infinitely Adjustable"},"image":null}

I read a lot of reviews and did my research and it seemed like this amp would be the best for me. I'm living in a college apartment so I didn't want to go too big and annoy my neighbors. I also didn't have much of a budget for a guitar amp, so I decided to buy low. The package came in a couple of days later and I opened it up and was amazed at the size of this thing! The picture makes it look like an eraser but it's the size of a man's shoebox. The clean channel sounds unbelievably clean. I couldn't help but compare it to my old Ibanez IBZ-10 Tone Blaster Amp which sounded like there was a perpetual colony of bees hiving inside the speaker. The volume gets pretty loud even for its size and it still maintains that clean sound even at 12 gain and 12 volume. The \"overdrive\" setting is cool too. I haven't tinkered with that one too much, but it's fun to play \"Johnny B. Goode\" on.\n\nI didn't want to buy an amp that had all of the shiny bells and whistles that fall off after the first month. I wanted a quality amp for a low price, and I got it. You can always buy pedals to get all those cool sounds, and I plan on doing that too, but you need a good amp with a good clean channel like this one before you start getting into other effects. I would definitely recommend this amp to the college apartment dweller and to anyone else who wants an amazing practice amp.\n\nI'm not sure if this would be the best gigging amp though, but then again, I don't see myself gigging anytime soon.","summary":"Amazing Amp for the Apartment College Dweller on a Shoe String Budget","unixReviewTime":1378512000,"vote":"4","style":{"Color:":" Classic"},"image":null}

VERY picky. I (normally) use Beats Studio headphones, Bose package in my car, and Klipsch for my home theater and computer speakers. That being said, I wanted something to use that sounded great and was as comfortable as my Beats Studios but wouldn't break the bank. Obviously the sound quality isn't on-par with the Beats for this price, but it isn't meant to be. The quality is though, plenty sufficient to me. If the speakers produced a bit more low-end these would probably be the perfect pair of headphones. I record music at home and when someone is recording their instrument I'll let them wear the Beats while I wear these. They cancel a bit of noise due to their over-the-ear design, they sound great, and (most importantly?) they are extremely comfortable. I can wear these through hours of recording with no regrets.

I'm the guitarist but also serve as the sound guy\/engineer so I was getting fed up with our old mics. Our female vocalist doesn't sing super loud and I was always cranking her gain; feedback was not uncommon.\n\nWith these mics, feedback is a lot harder to come by and the voices actually CUT through the mix so they don't have to be THAT much louder than the instruments (MORE GUITAR! YAY!). There's a reason why these are considered to be industry-standard. They are a little bit of an investment, but not near as much other equipment I buy. This is totally worth it.

Stillwater","reviewText":"Are there other dynamic microphones that are better sounding than the SM58?  Yes.  Then why have I given it a 5 star?  Well I am glad you asked.  It's a legendary piece of musical equipment.  The microphone has existed for half a century, and I am willing to bet for all of you that are reading this that it will still exist when we all pass away.  There are three things that will survive a nuclear bomb.  Roaches, Keith Richards, and the SM58!  The durability of this microphone is amazing.  Just  youtube  SM58 and you will see some durability experiments that will speak for it self.  It can stand abuse like no other microphone period.  SM58 are standards live microphones in the industry.  Do they sound better than some Beyerdynamic Opus models or Sennheisers?  My opinion would be no, but you take to consideration when you have a Sound company they will use 80% to 90% of the time a SM58.  The reason is most soundmen have learned to eq around it and they are familiar with that microphone.  A sound guy that does not know a SM58 is not a sound technician to begin with.  If you know a little eq you can make this mic sound very good.  You buy a fancy dynamic mic and you run the risk of a sound guy screwing up your sound.  Anybody bashing this mic has to be reminded that legendary singers have all sung on a sm58 at one point.  From Robert Plant to Sinatra.  Not to mention every time you see a major festival it's the main mic on stage.  This mic has not changed it's specs or design since the 1960's.  What does that tell you?  For about $99 you have invested in microphone that will be with you most of your life.","summary":"Standard Microphone For Shure","unixReviewTime":1266969600,"vote":"7","style":null,"image":null}

I have a personal preference for the XLR ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside (first to slide down the cable) with a 4 legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters.  Unfortunately that design isn't used here, but I chose to award the 5 star rating for value because you get 15' of good quality shielded cable with 2 XLR ends (M and F) for well under $1\/ft.\n\nAs for pinout it's straightforward, pin 1 is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends, while pins 2 and 3 are run isolated between both ends.  The end design chosen uses the single set screw connector (the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart) and the rubber bumper design on the back which I haven't had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with, however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer's kit because they will be used not if but WHEN the need arises.\n\nAnother favorite of mine is the 6 pack of 3 foot male to female cables which do use my favorite XLR ends mentioned above, which amazon will rush you:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/GLS-Audio-3ft-Patch-Cable-Cords-XLR-Male-To-XLR-Female-Black-Cables-3-Balanced-Snake-Cord-6-PACK\/dp\/B000RYP83I\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">GLS Audio 3ft Patch Cable Cords - XLR Male To XLR Female Black Cables - 3' Balanced Snake Cord - 6 PACK<\/a>&nbsp;- these are very easy to open an end, change phase, lift ground, or input someone's oddball source signal.  Having 6 on hand means you won't quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix.\n\nBack to pyle's product here, I basically took away 1 star for not using the easy to open and re-wire XLRs but gave them a star for value in the product since it's 15 feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot.  It's also great when someone yells \"it's too short I need a cable stretcher at the podium!\" and quickly adds 15 feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasn't planned for or got moved\/quit working.  For the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing.\n\nI finally equipped my cable kit with the usual XLR to  RCA, 1\/4 TRS, hi-z transformers, and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the XLR terminals if need be, plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems, and a roll of gaffer's tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards.  I used to have 2ea 50 foot XLR cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now I have one left for my kit. With all that I had to build an emergency XLR to 2.5mm TS all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin.  Even though all this was under $100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on, so a bit of \"what if\" thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner's daugher's toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic.\n\nMy last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made.  It will no doubt be needed again, and since you made it you'll know why, how, and where it was used before, thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem.  People think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position.  My only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didn't serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted XLR 4 pin stereo Y splitter to dual TRS female cable I made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry.  I chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal, wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when I setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that (stereo) channel in rehersal at the console.","summary":"This gets 5 stars for value but doesn't use my favorite XLR end","unixReviewTime":1272326400,"vote":"4","style":{"Size:":" One Size"},"image":null}

(I got the sunburst.) To me it sounds good as well. The amp is sufficient for practice. The bag is NOT padded, but if you are careful it can be useful for transporting the guitar. Other than the unpadded bag I got exactly what was promised.

And you're looking to start playing bass guitar, but aren't so self-assured or financially inclined that you're looking to spend a lot of money on a beginning instrument.  Which brings you to starter sets in the first place.  You want everything you need at a good price while not sacrificing playability.  And to me: that's exactly what this set is.\n\nThe bass itself is quite nice, exceeding my expectations.  Any pictures you find online usually wash out the shine and make the color look flat and boring.  But it's a pretty striking, deep, shiny black.  It's not a $1000 bass, but it looks way nicer than the price would make you think it does.  As for sound, I've never played a bass before, so I have nothing to compare it to.  However, the amp brings the sound through pretty cleanly and warmly.  And I really have no complaints.\n\nThe thumb rest on the bass just seemed to detract from the aesthetic appeal, and got in my way when moving down a string.  I find it's just as easy to rest your thumb on the pickup when playing the E string.  Although it can be removed easily and in short order with an average-sized Phillips screwdriver, it leaves kind of unsightly screw holes behind, that had low-laying, somewhat jagged edges.  I filed that down carefully with some sandpaper, and it's now fine.  If there's anything I have against the bass, it's the thumb rest.  Since it's removable, it's really no big deal.  Just making note of it.\n\nRegarding accessories:\nThe case is, as others have said, not capable of protecting against anything except scratches or dust.  It's better than nothing, but the bottom-mounted zipper makes casing and uncasing awkward and slow, and I always worry about the fabric pulling on one of the tuning keys and untuning it.\n\nThe picks are picks.  Rounded, triangular pieces of plastic.  I haven't used them, because I've preferred finger-plucking so far.  Feels way more assured and direct, plus I find it easier to mute strings with the pick not in the way.  But they're a nice addition, for those that want them.\n\nThe strap is extremely simple.  It feels somewhat cheaply made and thin, but it will suffice, temporarily.  Just like the case, eventually you'll probably want another, better one.\n\nThe tuner feels kind of lightweight and flimsy, but it seems to work okay.  I have no thoughts that it will break soon unless I'm rough with it.\n\nThe DVD was a nice addition, and did teach me a little.  But most of the material can be absorbed in a single viewing, and probably figured out completely in three or four.  It's also quite short.  Also a nice addition (and includes electric and acoustic guitar sections) but you will want more books, DVDs, a teacher, or all of the above to really get onto learning the bass.\n\nThe bass guitar had been on my sizable list of \"Instruments to try out, eventually...\" for some time, but upon starting the anime series Beck (which any rock fan would love, regardless of age or thoughts toward Japanese animation) I realized it was simply time to start.  And I don't think I could have picked a better starter set for the price.  I've only had this thing for a day, but currently I'm 100% satisfied.  Shipping was super-quick, too.  I'll add to this review if anything breaks.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'd like to continue practicing...","summary":"Love My Silvertone Bass","unixReviewTime":1271808000,"vote":"3","style":{"Color:":" Liquid Black"},"image":null}

Ambient noise is not reduced greatly as a result, but this design improves sound quality.\n\nI have used the 600 ohm K240M phones since 1986.  The new K240S are 55 ohms making them far more compatible with todays lower voltage gear.  Even better, this new design gives deep bass response that I never thought was possible from phones.  Even a 32 foot bombarde pipe organ stop sounds quite real, although you will not feel the room shake.  Listening to a signal generator through these new K240S phones gives an impression of powerful bass down to at least 40 Hz.  The old K240M drops off below 100 Hz.  A slight dip in the midrange(K240M) has been filled in, making the K240S more true sounding.\n\nBoth the new and old versions reproduce operatic voices without increased \"ping\" which can be very abrasive.  Years ago I started using phones to judge voices on choral recordings, resorting to speakers only to judge the organ sound.  Speakers can make some beautiful voices sound nasty.  Producer John Culshaw documented this in one of his books on recording the Wagner Ring.\n\nThe open air design minimizes ear sweating while giving a more open perspective.  \"In your head\" effects are greatly suppressed compared to many sealed type phones.  When watching opera DVD I find no conflict between the phone perspective and the TV screen on DVD that are well mixed.  Orchestral sound is excellent, as is piano.  To my ears, these phones give a perspective and tonal balance that is very close to what I hear at Boston Symphony Hall, when I sit in the second balcony front.  These seats overhang the stage.  When I sing in a choir, the live perspective is even closer to what the phones produce, provided my position on stage is fairly central.  This is, in my opinion, a valid sound perspective, even if it is quite different from the tenth row center sound I aim for when I build speakers.  Non performers sometimes have trouble accepting this close a perspective at first, only because it is not familiar.  Many other phones give a perspective that is too close for comfort, a good reason to avoid the low end.\n\nIt is good to bear in mind that individual ears are unique in shape and that phones are designed to work on a \"standard ear\" made with an average shape.  Phones will give different response curves depending on how your ear pinnae and canal differs from that \"laboratory standard ear\" shape.\n\nPeople with small heads will have trouble keeping the phones on.  It is unfortunate that although this problem has been known for years, nothing has been done to correct this.\n\nAKG did not change any parts that touch your ears and head, a very wise move.  Some parts are interchangeble, as they have the same stock number on AKG parts lists.  Unfortunately AKG has of late been hard to deal with, making part purchases difficult.\n\nConsider buying the K 240 studio phones in the MK II version as you get a spare cord and spare ear pads with a velvet like feel. Having these extra parts on hand is worth the extra cost and makes this four star item a 5 star item.","summary":"IMPROVED VERSION OF K240 MONITOR AND A REAL THREAT TO SPEAKER SUPREMACY","unixReviewTime":1163721600,"vote":"231","style":null,"image":null}

Clear instrument separation regardless of the relatively minuscule soundstage compared to other open headphones. Again, very flat frequency response and good for mixing - though actual accuracy is a tad underwhelming. For actually listening, the mids are a tad too powerful by comparison to the low end for my taste - and I am by no means a basshead - but it can lead to some over-sibilant vocals and harsh cymbals overtaking the high end. It would be inappropriate to say that they're not top of the line for the price you pay though, as I'm truly nitpicking and wouldn't have expected them to sound any better.\n\nBUILD -\n\nWell, they're certainly lightweight. This comes at a cost though, as they're flimsy and cheaply constructed. Again, not unexpected for the price paid and honestly I'd rather have better sound than build at this price point. If you expect to really beat them up though, they'll most likely not appreciate it from a structural standpoint.\n\nVALUE -\n\nGreat, but not exceptional.

TWiT.TV uses these in their production, so that was certainly a plus and helped me to seal the purchase (as once you get into studio monitor quality headphones, they become harder to distinguish between them).\n\nThe EQ on these headphones is a flat one, unlike regular consumer headsets that focus extensively on bass (even some 'gaming' headsets have high focus on bass response to the detriment of music listening).\n\nAccording to TWiT.TV, these are studio quality headphones meant for playback and are designed to be used in production of media. I wholeheartedly agree and also state that these are well made and fit me well.\n\nI started looking at studio quality headsets when I discovered that my Steelseries gaming headset was starting the die (the cord was, once again, causing loss of sound in one ear piece and the microphone no longer worked). I would have normally stayed with the steelseries and bought a new one, but then I looked at the price for a v1 headset - it has not gone down once in the four years I have owned this model (actually a replacement for the same model) and remains at $60 or so. A new v2 headset is even more expensive and still has the same problems (non-removable cord, internal mic included, which is rather tiny).\n\nI decided the best way to solve this problem and to avoid having to buy new headphones every couple of years (at $60 per headphone, too!) was to separate the microphone from the headset (get a headset with no internal mic) and focus on headsets that promote removable cords (as at that point replacement cords can be had cheaply, rather than replacing the whole setup).\n\nAs I have heard, AKG is not a well-known brand of studio quality headsets (here in Amercia, Sony-brand studio monitors and alike are the norm in productions that I have observed) but my quality assessment of these is that they sound GREAT.\nThe price was just right, only a few dollars more than a replacement headset, and the specs are even better looking than my old gaming headset. These are semi-open headphones, so others may be able to hear what you're listening to - but I usually run my computers at 21 volume because I have sensitive ears (I hate loud volume, unlike every one else in my family who are all 100-volume users).\n\nMy experience is that I can not hear the music from any distance with these headphones at the usual 21 volume. The bass and treble are all perfectly natural and the virtual stage (a 2.0 setup) makes sounds in the music more clear than they ever were with my old headset. I can pick out the individual instruments in the classical music easily with these headphones, whereas before they were all meshed together because of the massive bass boost on the older gaming headset.\n\nI am highly satisfied with my purchase and will definitely buy from this brand again, should I need to.","summary":"Great headset, sturdy, with a flat EQ (no bass boost).

Used them for about 15 years until they were damaged in a mishap.  I've had other 'phones since then, most notably the Nakamichi SP-7, but none I liked as much as that old pair from the past.  So when I saw that they were either still - or once again - available (and on sale) I had to get a pair especially since I'm using headphones a lot lately.  I just had to know whether they were as good as I recalled.\n\nThey are better.  Improved, I guess.  They still look, feel and fit the same - and that's a good thing.  The bass is deep and well-defined, not artificially boosted but can thump with the best when a thump is on the recording(Gov't Mule's \"Lay Your Burden Down\").  Highs are clean and well-extended - certainly they go higher than my 10khz cutoff hearing - younger folks who've passed through like the highs.  Mids sound good, with virtually none of the congestion you can get with lesser 'phones or speakers.  As the mids become more complex due to multiple instruments, its easy to follow just one (for instance cello in several quartets I sampled).\n\nDynamics are great, as heard in Glenn Miller Orchestra, \"In the Digital Mood,\"  \"Chattanooga Choo Choo\" track, and the Tchaikovsky \"1812 Overture\" in this case on Telarc.  With movies, explosions can be startling.\n\nIn addition to sound quality, these headphones are also superlative in other ways.  One is the way they fit.  Yes, they are pretty large, but the large cups fit around the ear and press against the skull, which reduces ear soreness to virtually none.  The gimbal construction, which auto adjusts when simply put on the head has always been a strong point of this headphone.  I can wear them for hours with no ear soreness.\n\nAlso, fit and finish is excellent - AKG have obviously kept QC standards up despite having these made now in China.  Connections are first-rate, and the cable enters at the Left earcup as the good Lord intended.  I love the compactness and fit of the screw-on 1\/4\" plug (an adaptor that fits over the 1\/8\" - 3.5mm - plug).\n\nThe one area in which the headphone does not excel is isolation, but that is to be expected with an open (they call it semi-open) type cup construction.  On the other hand, it is extremely difficult to attain this level of sonic excellence in a closed-back design.  I've heard none, if they exist, but even if there is one I'm sure it would be much more pricey.  Generally, one just expects to give up the \"airy\" sound of an open design with a closed headphone, so it depends on the importance of isolation to the listener.  I have a pair of closed-backs to use when needed, but most of the time I'll be using these.\n\nI'm not saying these are perfect, but they are as close as I'll get, since I certainly won't spend more than a c-note on headphones - it just wouldn't be prudent.  I pushed my own limits to get these at just less than seventy bucks, and I'm darned glad that I did.  My opinion then is obvious - best at the price, and better than many to which I've listened in the past that were much more expensive.","summary":"Strong Five-Star Product:  Excellent Sound, Looks, Fit 'n Finish, Comfort, and Value","unixReviewTime":1412035200,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

Straight forward review.  No technical talk for those that understand great specs do not always mean great headphones.  These do have great specs, by the way.\n\nI have a pair of older 240s that are 600 ohms.  These are essentially the same except they are 55 ohms.  So, it takes less power to drive them.  What that means is that if you use a low output device (phone, computer, etc.) you will get more volume.  The volume is considerably louder than the older 240s and most studio reference headphones.  However, they are not nearly as loud as headphones designed specifically for portable devices.  All that said, they sound great with my Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Tab Pro.  You do not need a separate headphone amp.  Normal people do not use headphone amps.  I dont; know why everyone always talks about them.  No amp needed.  If you are using these with mixing board or plunging them into an old-fashioned stereo, you certainly do not need an amp. they are loud.  With a portable device they are louder than most people would need.  but again, not as loud as something designed for a portable device.\n\nAs far as sound, these are some of the best sounding headphones I have tried.  The sound is flat - like it should be.  All sounds, highs, mids, and lows, come through crystal clear.  Unless you want to spend several hundreds of dollars more, I really haven;'t heard anything even close to the 240s.  Cranked up, they handle loud volume without distorting.\n\nAs far a comfort, these are the single most comfortable headphones ever made.  Period!  They are circumaural, which means they fit completely around your ear.  They completely go around your ear (at least my ear) without any on-ear pressure.  They are light weight and the adjustable band literally makes them weightless.  Within a few minutes you will forget they are on.  I watched a movie on my computer and had these on for about 2 1\/2 hours.  There was no strain or pressure anywhere.  My ears and the top of my head didn't feel anything.\n\nThe 240s also have a detachable replaceable cord. this is abig plus as cords are the things which seem to go bad before anything else.\n\nI realize sound preferences and fit are completely subjective.  For me they are the best phones I have ever owned.  For sound and comfort the AKG 240 Studio headphones are as good a it gets.","summary":"One of the best headphones out there!","unixReviewTime":1404864000,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

Also I can listen to music for hours and hours on them because they are so non-fatiguing: marvelously balanced and even have a slight treble roll-off, which is fine for someone getting on in years like me who's probably already lost a bit of the higher frequency hearing (above 15KHz).  The Grados on the other hand are impressive when you first plug them in because they are rather \"hot\"---the highest and lowest frequencies seem to be accentuated, which makes them kind of \"fun\" headphones especially if you listen to a lot of bass-heavy and\/or high-tempo pop\/dance or hard rock type music.\n\nThe AKGs are particularly exquisite if you are into midrange-dominant music like jazz, classical, or vocal music: instruments and voices come across with remarkable realism in tonality and timbre, and quickly become very addictive.  Whereas on the Grados the midrange seemed rather thin and recessed, and overshadowed by the treble and bass.\n\nSo really, it all depends on your preferences.  The physical comfort of the AKGs is less subjective, however: they are easily the most comfortable over-the-ear phones I've ever tried.  This is a HUGE factor worth considering.\n\n4 and 1\/2 stars: 1\/2 star deduction for the vinyl-covered earpads heating up my head, but I probably should've ordered the K240 Mk 2 version which come swith the velour earpads instead...kind of wish they had come with more breathable foam earpads like the Grados instead, but I imagine AKG chose not to because these insulate the sound better and form a better seal which allows for more bass.\n\nSpeaking of which, you'd have to be a total BASS-HEAD to say that these babies don't put out enough bass...I find them to have MORE than adequate bass, and it's nice tight accurate bass not the sloppy boomy kind that teenagers are generally used to and have blaring out of their cheesy car subwoofers.\n\nLast point: sound leakage with this \"semi-open\" design was far less than anticipated.  You can only hear the music if blasting it; at casual\/comfortable listening levels they were fine...I tried it out in a public library.  Certainly far less leakage than the Grados.  Haven't tried them out in a noisy environment yet to see how their sound isolation compares to my in-ear headphones, but that's not a fair fight anyway...I probably wouldn't recommend taking these with you on a flight!","summary":"Excellent for the money, might be all you ever need","unixReviewTime":1373500800,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

People who are mixing or editing sound prefer \"accurate\" but many music listeners prefer the accentuated bass.  These headphones let you hear what is on the track an add nothing to that.  The sound is transparent, as if you were not wearing headphones.  Also being \"semi-open\" this means they do not block sound in either direction.  This open design adds to the not-wearing-headphones sound but is not practical in some settings.  Remember these are STUDIO headphones.  They provide accurate sound for engineers and are best used in a quiet studio setting.  If you are a music listener at home then the best use of these headphones is for classical or jazz in a quiet living room.  or for critical listening to any music, for example recently I was trying to listen to Paul McCarney's bass guitar lines in some new and old recordings. With these I can hear every note and also how he played the strings with his fingers.  The K240 provide an accurate, reserved sound for that kind of listening, not the popular flashy and thumpy sound.\n\nSerious headphone users will find they need several pair but one pair should be these.","summary":"Very accurate sound but not for everyone","unixReviewTime":1306886400,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

They are still a decent buy, and I can't recommend another semi-open in this price range, but the closed offerings in the bracket are MUCH better options in my opinion. I'm talking about the usual suspects the MDR-7506 and ATH-M50 are my two favorites.\n\n----- Back to 2008 -----\n\nThese are considered the studio standard in circumaural open back headphones for good reason. The sound reproduction is excellent, with clear bass and midrange and a very balanced profile through the entire frequency spectrum. It makes me angry at how much I've spent on speakers and studio monitors, these do a better job at a fraction of the price.\n\nThey are circumaural they fit OVER your ears. I guess some people don't like that. I think they might change their mind if they tried these. If you're looking for a SUPRA-aural design look at the AKG K141\n\nI find them extremely comfortable. I have literally forgotten I was wearing them more than once. The suspension system adjusts automagically and is excellent. At first I felt a little unsure about the security of the hold, I've been using these mostly as monitors while recording guitar and bass parts, but they've made it through some pretty enthusiastic headbanging without getting dislodged. It also prevents almost all the banging and noise you normally hear when handling your headphones.\n\nThe ear pads are soft and comfortable and have a nice synthetic cover which feels like glove leather and has just the right combination of grip and smoothness.\n\nThey are semi-open. In this case it means that with no sound coming out of them they are basically aurally transparent but when they are on it takes a pretty loud sound outside to be noticeable. They are excellent at the job I use them for, monitoring a master track while laying down new parts, because you can hear yourself and the room sound pretty naturally and still have a high quality monitor with no bleed through to the mic'ed amps. If you are intending to use these for monitoring during vocal track recording you might want to consider a closed back design, these can be a little loud close up, The K271 is an excellent option with an ingenious auto-mute feature that work off the same magical suspension system.\n\nOther Cool Features:\n\nmini-xlr connector on cord - replace your mangled cord or make your own!\nfully rebuildable and modular - any component can be replaced if neccesary\n\nGripes:\n\nIt ships with a 3m mini-xlr to 1\/8 cord w\/ 1\/4 adapter, I think most people would prefer the coiled cord which they sell as an option.\n\nThe suspension may 'feel' a bit insecure at first, and the pads may wiggle a bit if you shake your head really hard. a manual tension adjustment on the suspension might be a nice addition.\n\nYou really need a case for your studio headphones. As far as I know there isn't one available for these.","summary":"Finally a product where 'Studio' in the name is more than marketing hype","unixReviewTime":1201651200,"vote":"56","style":null,"image":null}

This said volumes to me about the acceptance by the real professionals. Bought my first pair back then and have had them over the years, occassionally upgrading to newest technology model. I happened to be in the discotheque business back then and I bought AKG's for DJ use in all six of our clubs throughout the country. These are fantastic with full range of natural sound from lows to highs. Does not color the sound and they really kick if you loop them through EQ. Ain't nothin' better. I am so spoiled that sometimes I prefer listening to concert DVD's with these on rather than listening \"full room\" with my very expensive and well appointed home component audio system. And I occassionally go back to my original set of AKG's purchased in 1976 and they still sound awesome, although the rubber ear pads have become rather hardened and I cant wear them for long. My only complaint about this new pair of \"around the ear\" phones is that you tend to sweat a bit after wearing them through a movie. I also have a set of fairly recent model 141's that are the \"on the ear\" smaller pad model with very soft foam pads and I must say that I probably prefer them to the full ear enclosure, for that reason.

We have run it through a variety of PA systems as well as a Roland KC-110 keyboard amp and the sound quality is consistently superb.\n\nComparing it to an SM58 this one is about on par. Neither mic is particularly hot and both do best when run through a mic pre amp, but for the small rooms we play this is not necessary.\n\nOne of the best points about this is it is comfortable and the mic itself can be adjusted closer or farther for better control over vocal quality. Also it is less apt to feedback. To me this is important in the small rooms we play because some handheld mics that we use are problematic in that aspect.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent wired headset that does a competent job with vocals in small venues. If you use SM58s you have a good idea about the sound characteristics, so that is not going to require much of an adjustment. Plus this mic is built to withstand a heavy gigging schedule (we use the original box to store it.) The latter is one of the main reasons why I awarded this headset five stars.","summary":"Real work horse and decent sound quality","unixReviewTime":1423353600,"vote":null,"style":{"Size:":" 3-pin Male XLR"},"image":null}

Listening to these makes it evident that the engineers who worked on this product really made an effort to sweat the small details that make for truly good sound. The crossover network (the electronic circuit that transfers high frequencies to the tweeter and low frequencies to the woofer) is one of the most critical components in a good loudspeaker system, and it's not easy to get it right in a passive loudspeaker system - but the Alesis engineers managed to do it. The result is smooth imaging and sound dispersion through the midrange and into the high frequencies, which makes the sound seem \"larger than the box\" - you never hear a little wooden box, instead you hear a glorious expanse of sound filling the entire sound stage.\n\nI'd recommend these Alesis monitors not only to home recording engineers, but also for general music and TV listening. If you're used to muffled consumer-grade speakers, these monitors will sound a little bright at first - and then you'll notice how much more detail you're hearing in the music, detail that is obscured by lower quality speakers.\n\nThe Monitor One's have good bass response for their size, but this is inevitably limited by the 5\" effective piston diameter of the woofers. I added a budget Velodyne VX-11 subwoofer to extend the bass response of the Monitor One's. The subwoofer is set to roughly a 70 Hz crossover frequency, and about 8 o'clock on the sub volume knob. The Velodyne integrates very smoothly with the Monitor One's at these settings, and the overall sound is nothing short of superb - for a total budget of about $300 for both monitors and subwoofer! Outstanding sound on the cheap!\n\nI have not heard anything that sounds audibly better than these Alesis Monitor One's until you get to the Mackie HR 824's in the $1300 range - more than *seven times* the Amazon price of the Alesis Monitor One's!\n\nAs an aside, these passive Alesis Monitor One's sound much better than the active Alesis M1 Active Mk II monitors do. The active monitors use the same woofer and tweeter, and the active crossover network is even smoother, but unfortunately the M1 Active's have very sloppy, boomy, undefined one-note bass that ruins the otherwise smooth balance of their sound. A real pity.\n\nIn summary, if you're looking to spend under $1300 for a pair of monitors, check these Alesis Monitor One Mk 2 out. There's a lot to love about them, and not much to critique.","summary":"Likely  the best monitors under $1000 - and these cost under $200!","unixReviewTime":1284076800,"vote":"29","style":null,"image":null}

I used them for front speakers in a home theater sound system, for recording studio monitors, as stereo speakers in my home audio system, and I've used them as PA speakers for practice drum sessions. Except for a tweeter that blew about eight years ago (and Alesis was GREAT! providing a replacement tweeter) these speakers are still going strong. You will not find a more robust, better sounding pair of studio monitors for the money, especially at the sale prices being offered now (3\/4\/10). In fact, I just ordered my second pair of Monitor Ones on Tuesday. I've been overdue for a pair of the MK IIs, which are magnetically shielded. The original Monitor Ones are not magnetically shielded, something to keep that in mind if you're looking to buy used. You'll want a magnetically shielded pair if you plan on housing the monitors near a TV or computer.\n\nHere's an example of the Monitor Ones reproduction detail: I had my brother visiting one day. I sat him down about four feet away from the speakers and put on a Joe Satriani CD. We got to this one song and all of a sudden my brother looked up and said: \"Wow, that's the first time I ever heard that.\" He was talking about a little pic work that you won't hear on anything but a good set of near-field studio monitors.\n\nI'm know there are other excellent near-field monitors out there, and there's almost no limit on what you can spend. M-Audio are highly rated, and the new top shelf Tannoys and JBLs are $1,000 and $1,500, respectively.\n\nIf you're a professional recording engineer or musician, that's one thing. You can probably justify spending a lot more. But if you're in the semi-pro category or just an audiophile who wants the hear the music as it was intended to be heard, I don't think you'll be disappointed with these monitors.\n\n-seabgb","summary":"Excellent Studio Monitors","unixReviewTime":1267660800,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

I've been using AV40s since 2010 and they died on me.  These feel like they will last a lifetime and I hope they do.  Right now I am driving them with an old Sony STR D615 100w receiver and they sound and respond great.  I will probably purchase another studio quality amp at a later date but for now there is no need.  I can hear my mixes more clearly for the first time and already have made some adjustments to them because of the Monitor Ones!  I was unaware of bad mixes using my old monitors.  These also sound good with all other music devices (cd, radio etc).\n\nI've read some reviews that said the bass is lacking...that is far from the truth...the bass is tight and strong...so much that I found that I have been over compensating with my old monitors.  The highs and the mids are good as well.  I wish I purchased these a long time ago...I would have saved some money!

I have them sitting in extreme near field, 3 feet apart and 3 feet from my ears and the detail and imaging are superb even at low volume.

(They are spec'd to 45 Hz.)\n\nRated at 4 ohms, in my setup they are powered by a Luxman 50 watt per channel receiver, a clean amp which while not that powerful, drives them just fine at low to middling high volume.\n\nHighly recommended!

So far I've put it through some use in both contexts and it's performed wonderfully.\n\nIn a live application, I've used it as a vocal mic- there seems to be some debate over whether this or the Beta 58 is a better choice for live vocals, and I'd say that having heard both used onstage, I like the 57A because it cuts through the muddiness of most small venues a lot better. If you're playing a killer sounding room like, I don't know... the Ryman, it likely won't matter, but in the brewery barroom that resembled a really crowded hallway that we played the other night it made all the difference in the world over even an SM58- it was nice to hear myself sounding more like myself in the monitor. I've also noticed a few musicians that I respect a lot using it, and even Obama had one in his hand the other night while giving a speech.\n\nIn my home studio, I've used the 57A to mic a snare (sounds killer, tons of snap and body), acoustic guitar (not bad at all, although I prefer an SDC mic here), and a guitar cabinet (sounds great.)\n\nOverall, I don't think you can go wrong with this mic. I'd like to add a Beta 58 to the collection as well, but after a lot of research I think the 57A is the most versatile of the two so if you're on a limited budget as most musicians are, I'd go with this.

As I use my 1200 for both DJing and normal listening, I switch the M44G and my slipmat out for my Shure M97xE and standard Technics rubber mat as needed. So far, it has proven itself and has exceeded my expectations. I am rather new to DJing with real vinyl which should be taking into account. But, while I was practicing, it never lost track while both cueing and when doing spin-backs and other things. I am not a scratch DJ, however, so I didn't try any of that type of stuff and the M44-7 seems to be Shure's recommended choice for scratching.\n\nCompared to my M97xE cartridge it is louder in both raw output and in the music being heard off the turntable directly. The latter bit is a clue that the M44G is probably a bit harder on vinyl than the M97xE. It is, a DJ cartridge, after all. Of note, it has a lower recommended tracking force than the DJ cartridges from other brands that I was looking at and Shure mentions it offers ultra low record wear. Still, I will continue to use my M97xE when I'm not DJing.\n\nThe overall sound of the M44G is just fantastic! The highs are pronounced and clear and the bass defined and boomey. I thought it unfair to directly compare it to the sound of my M97xE as it has seen more use and the needle is no longer new. Plus, I use it the M97xE with the brush down which can impact audio quality a bit. Really, a direct comparison is a bit silly anyway as the M44G is for DJing first.

{"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"08 3, 2017","reviewerID":"A2DGTXMXB44JF6","asin":"B0002BG2S6","reviewerName":"T. Tozawa","reviewText":"If you're looking for a quality, compact stereo mixer to combine multiple audio sources and output to a single pair of headphones or speakers, this device works perfectly. Measuring roughly 5 inches by 3 inches, its construction is solid and surprisingly made in the USA. All of the ports feature a nice and tight fit and the knobs are silky smooth. It's powered by a power adapter which is included.\n\nIt has four separate channel inputs and two output options. Channel 1 is an XLR input with phantom power option (which you can turn on\/off). Channel 2 input is via RCA or 3.5mm. Channels 3 and 4's input are RCA. Output is via RCA or 3.5mm. There are more than enough ways you can set this up depending on your devices and needs. If you need to use 3.5mm, either as an input or output, you can simply buy a 3.5mm to RCA cable adapter.\n\nSome reviews complain about static, hissing, or lowered volume; I have not encountered any of these issues under normal use. As long as you are using quality cables and your source output devices aren't cheap, no audio issues should be encountered. I can easily control each channel's volume independently with no loss in audio quality. Turning the knob all the way down will completely mute the source and turning it up has more than ample volume (although this may vary a bit depending on the quality of your output device). The only actual hissing I can hear (using headphones) is when you get near max volume on the knob when all other channels are silent. At the volumes you encounter the hissing at, you would blow your eardrums out. Under normal use, you don't hear it at all.\n\nThere are obviously several ways you can hook this up. For reference, I am using it to connect the audio from my PC and the audio from my game consoles (PS4 and Switch) and have it all output to my headphones. In my case, the game consoles are hooked up to a Denon A\/V receiver and I am using the headphone output from it to connect to the stereo mixer. For the PC audio, I am simply using the front 3.5mm output and have it connected to the stereo mixer. From the stereo mixer, I have the output audio plug into an external headphone amplifier which then finally outputs it to my headphones. My headphone amplifier definitely helps with overall volume, but even without it, the stereo mixer has plenty of power to output enough volume even to my higher ohm headphones from Sennheiser and AKG. Even hitting about halfway on the knob gets too loud and about a quarter of the way is good enough for normal use.\n\nWith this particular setup, I can now get game sounds and if needed, I can stream music from my PC at the same time. Or I can use voice chat on the PC instead of using Playstation's party chat or the Nintendo Switch's currently horrible (non-existent) chat system. And of course if I just want one audio source, then I can simply turn down the knob on the stereo mixer to mute it completely.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent compact stereo mixer which makes life easier if you have a setup requiring multiple audio sources outputting to a single headphone\/speaker setup at the same time. It works well as somewhat of an audio switcher as well without actually having to switch inputs or cables around. If this sounds like what you need, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product.","summary":"Works perfect for my PC and Game Console audio to Headphone setup (Listen to both at the same time!)","unixReviewTime":1501718400,"vote":"2","style":{"Color:":" Black"},"image":null}

Has an elastic strap to keep instrument from falling out of the suspension fork, but I've never found it necessary to use.\n\nFolds into a nicely compact form, and it's sturdy enough, but its chief virtue is that it suspends the instrument by the peghead (sorry, you post-moderns who play the \"headless\" guitars) and doesn't have the bottom bracket to get tangled in the strap when you need to change instruments quickly.\n\nOne caution--depending on the shape of the peghead and placement of your machine heads you may find that the suspension fork can nudge the tuning pegs.  I haven't found it a problem, but if you have a banjo, for instance, with easy-turning planetary tuners, you might need to be careful in \"hanging\" the instrument.","summary":"Excellent guitar stand","unixReviewTime":1179100800,"vote":"13","style":{"Style:":" Hanging Style w\/ Saftety Strap"},"image":null}
