Before you go ballistic on me, though, let me say WHY this game has infuriated me.\nEssentially, this game is the exact same as Infection. You still run around computer generated dungeons, trying to forward the story (which does get a bit more interesting, but not NEARLY enough to save this game). You still data drain and gate hack and fight big bosses with your ever-growing party (all of the new characters, incidentally, have the most annoying voices and inane dialogue imaginable) until you duke it out with a super boss at the end, and save your data to load into the next game.\nOf course, this isn't enough to warrant 1 star; indeed I played the first game and liked it, despite being too easy and a bit short (only 20-25 hours to beat the last boss). No, where this game fails is the following: You are actually PENALIZED for purchasing and playing the first game! By playing Infection, you essentially remove half of the levels in Mutation! That's right; BANDAI, in its infinite wisdom, decided that they would put amny of the levels from Infection into Mutation, I guess so that they could bring in some new saps. Of course, that means that they've given the shaft to fans of the game, figuring that we're so stupidly addicted to their product that we will purchase the sequels, no matter WHAT they do. So, there are no benefits to playing the first game, except that you can keep you old emails and character name (whoopee). I finished Mutation in 9 hours. NINE!!!!\nI've already been burned, but I hope I can give YOU an option. If you want to play 9 hours for fifty bucks, buy the game.

And like those two, it's a horrible game.\nThe camera is sloppy. Not as bad as Hidden Invasion, but it can sometimes get stuck at inappropriate places (I ain't talkin' in a good way either!), and you have no control over it.\nThe gameplay is monotonous. You knock thugs around and then follow an arrow to where you beat more people up. At some point in the stage, you press the A button to activate a switch or call another Angel.\nThe controls are awkward. Once again, the analog shoulder buttons are used at full disadvantage: you have to press them all the way in until they click. On the default control set-up, you jump with B, punch with Y, kick with X, pick stuff up with A, focus on an enemy with R, switch targets with Z, and temporarily power-up with L. This setting can be frustrating when trying to perform an arial attack. You can also switch the actions of B and X, but that doesn't really make things easier. If you have to know, the Start button pauses the game and brings up a menu, the control stick moves the Angel, and the cross-pad and yellow C-stick do nothing as far as I remember.\nThe music is so-so, with various techno-tunes and a louzy digital song at the Start Menu.\nYou can access bonus features, such as a Teaser, photos, and...uh, I can't remember what else, by collecting CDs and memory sticks scattered around the areas. You can also watch each computer-generated Full-Motion Video piece as many times as you want after you get to that part in the game.\nThe character models might pass for okay on an earlier console, but on today's systems, I expect more polygons and better textures. The outfits aren't too bad though.\nI don't recommend buying this game or even playing it.

So let's just rate it on quality of programming and enjoyment of gameplay, shall we?\nThe graphics: Not bad, but certainly not on par with games like No One Lives Forever 2 and Mafia. The game does utilize the Unreal engine and has some nice textures here and there, but the town has a very artificial and claustrophobic feel to it. The NPC textures are o.k., as well, but nowhere near those in Return to Castle Wolfenstein.\nThe sounds: Very so-so. I found the weapon sounds in particular to be very unrealistic - especially the AR15. (It sounds like an airgun.) In a game where gunplay is an essential part of the fun, this is a glaring flaw.\nA.I. - Not nearly good enough to be satisfying in the way the game claims to aspire to. To truly descend into the cellar of bad taste, the NPC's would have to behave in a believable manner, with a certain complexity of interaction available. As it stands, the NPC's have a very limited range of behaviors. This, combined with the so-so graphics makes for a very artificial environment.\nGameplay: Obviously, the creators did not have the funding nor programming talent to make Postal 2 into a game with cutting-edge graphics and groundbreaking gameplay. Even with these limitations, however, the developers could have made the game far more fun with just a little thought into what makes all of us want to go \"postal\". Getting stuck in traffic, having to wait in long lines, getting diss'd by a rude employee - with a little creativity, the programmers could have inserted these scenarios into the game to add fuel to our virtual postal tendencies. As it stands, apart from the postal dude's general psychosis, your player has no real motivation to go wacky - and the A.I. just isn't good enough to make it fun when you do. Without these assets, any open-ended environment - no matter how big - won't keep you coming back for more...\nSystem Specs: P4 1.9ghz, 512mb rambus, Geforce4 Ti4600 128mb, Soundblaster Xgamer.

Smith","reviewText":"Developer Running With Scissors was obviously trying to cash in on the popularity of Rockstar's \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, and they failed miserably.  The game is boring and pointless.\nThe plot is simple: the player assumes the role of \"The Postal Dude\" and, each day, sets off to complete a list of boring tasks, like going to the store for milk.  Invariably each mundane task ends in disaster as various nutty groups in the game burst in and start shooting.\nThe game plays up the \"choice\" the player has, whether to be passive or to \"go postal\" with various weapons.  There's no reason to play passive, and the novelty of the over-the-top violence gets old fast.  Characters spout inane dialog, and the only high point of the game is when Gary Coleman (yes, Gary Coleman) makes an appearance at a mall which, of course, ends in a gun battle.\nAlthough powered by the Unreal engine, Postal 2 looks drab.  Out of the box, the game has some serious bugs, including ridiculously long load times between levels.  This gets frustrating fast as there are so many level changes to get from point A to point B.  A recent patch has fixed this issue, but the game remains a pointless exercise in futility.\nSometimes the saving grace for a bad single-player game can be the multiplayer option.  \"Postal 2\" does not have multiplayer.  Instead, you have to actually purchase the multiplayer add-on for $9.95.  Running With Scissors might have scored an extra star had it released the multiplayer part for free, as was the case with the \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\" multiplayer expansion, \"Enemy Territory,\" which started life as an expansion to RTCW and ended up being a free stand-alone product.\nYou're better off spending the $20 on the vastly superior \"Grand Theft Auto III\" or, for ten bucks more, \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.\"  Either choice is a better one than the terminally boring \"Postal 2.\"","summary":"Not worth the code it was compiled with","unixReviewTime":1071792000,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

Otherwise SOF plays just about like any other first person shooter.\nThis game is touted for its \"realistic\" weapons damage.

Recalling my \"experience\" with this game, I cracked my knuckles (no pun intended you nerd) and got to some salty typing.\nAs with all Sonic games, it is just a matter of how much it sucks. This one, my dears, excels in that aspect. If you gave a cutting edge team ten-million euros and told them to make the worst game they could, it could never approach the unfocused imbecility that is this game.\nIt is well known that if you try to fail, it often shows. Here, we can enjoy the steamy pile that is a failed attempt at success. So bad is this game, that I am surprised it isn't mentioned along the same lines as \"Waterloo\", \"The Invasion of Russia\", and \"Donald Trump's Hairpiece\".\nThe endless repetition and plotless fever-dream vibe aside, we can focus on the characters. Because I hate them.\nSonic is either too slow or too twitchingly fast to control. Tails is just kinda...Tails. Knuckles does a weird floating thing. (Like Echidnas are known for) And Amy...Oh, Amy. She misrepresents woman-kind as a hopeless fanatic of her dear Sonic, despite the fact he has as much personality as a Chili Dog, and the same depth as a modern Shyamalan film. (Perhaps a snide remark about Sonic Fans?) Big the Cat suffers from an advanced form of brain damage, and his \"Froggy\" quests are more broken then Gorbachev's Perestroika. Oh, yeah- the robot sucks too.\nShould you fork over the pecuniary assets necessary to buy this...thing-you are in for the biggest flustercluck since Bubsy 3D wooed Superman 64. Is this game bad? Yes. In the same way Ebola is \"bad.\" Or your parachute failing to open. Or having to take down a portrait from the family wall. Or listening to a child cry. Or writing reviews for this sodding heap. It is bad, my dear. If my review inspires interest, I apologize.

It is absolutely awful. Not only does it attempt to throw mud on everything that was great and original about FFX, but the scariest part is it almost succeeds!\n\nFor those who seem to love this game (preteens and anime geeks, I imagine), let's break it down the same way you all did, only this is strictly for those who like QUALITY game play, QUALITY characters, and above all, NO JAPANESE POP SONGS OR POP PRINCESSES!\n\nPlot: Like being trapped in the worst anime and having to play as the characters in one excruciating scenario after another. Yuna, Rikku (most annoying character from the previous game makes a new appearance! Yay!), and emo girl Paine are now singing sensations in Spira! Nefarious villains seem to dislike your newfound pop success, and in a pointless quest for mundane spheres, cackle and plot in such over-dramatic form it would make the Wicked Witch of the West melt in embarrassment.\n\nCharacters: The aforementioned Yuna and Rikku have all their most annoying traits laid bare in this game. While you could forgive the sometimes weak dialog and annoying vocal talents of them in FFX, they don't have such sweet characters as Auron or Lulu to balance them. Emo girl Paine is hardly a good enough replacement. \"Oh, I'm sulky and beautiful and the world doesn't understand me. I'm going to funnel my angst into my songs.\"\n\nGameplay: The biggest difference between FFX and its sequel is the reintroduction of classes, a much-beloved ability that allows characters to assume the roles of mages, gunslingers, swordsmen, and other useful roles. Not so in this game. You switch between them in battle, meaning you don't stick with one class for longer than a few monsters, meaning you never associate any character with any one class, meaning they become frivolous fast. And who the hell wants to be a \"singer\" in the middle of a battle? Oh, right, preteens and anime geeks.\n\nMusic: *gag*\n\nOverall: The darkest hour in Final Fantasy history was when this game was released. It's a discredit to other games such as the masterful FFVIII that are given the same rating on Amazon as this one. If you buy it, I very much hope you are only buying it to melt it into unrecognizable plastic so it can be recycled. Otherwise you are encouraging this scatter-brained drivel to be reproduced in the future.","summary":"An abomination in sheep's clothing","unixReviewTime":1247875200,"vote":"2","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Sigh, just thinking about this game gets my blood boiling.  I can't for the life of me understand why some people are giving this 5 stars.  Well, first off, just let me say that I am female.  It should be glaringly obvious that this game is targeted towards a female audience (or so Square-Enix may believe).  Unfortuneately, I was sickened by this game.  Well, let's start with something good.\n\nGraphics (10\/10): Not bad at all.  I'm not too picky about graphics and I can honestly say that these are pretty good.  Bright, shiny, nice for a PS2 game.\n\nMusic (4\/10): Honestly, this is a matter of opinion, but I didn't like the mix of jazz, techno and pop that made up this soundtrack.  The final fantasy series is known for its beautiful classical-style music, and this game is a huge departure from that.  The airship music made me want to turn off the sound and put a previous game's soundtrack into my cd player.  The only song I really liked was \"A Thousand Words\".\n\nCharacters (0\/10): This section may even deserve a negative rating.  It's like Square-Enix decided to make a game just for the women out there-except they chose the top 10% of the female populous that were the most stupid, shallow, and air-headed people they could find for advice on what to put in this game.  This game gives real women a bad image.  Yuna, a mature, intelligent character I love from FF10, has been kidnapped and replaced with a body double who has the intellect of a card-board box covered in glitter.  I mourned the loss of the real Yuna.  FF10 Yuna grappled with such deep and complex issues as self-sacrifice and questioning her faith, FF10-2 Yuna likes playing dress-up and uses words like \"dissasteriffic\".  Honestly, the other two characters are no better; they are just as shallow and stupid.  I was actually excited about the all-female cast, I was expecting the intelligence-level of the female characters from FF10--not to be found here.\n\nStory (1\/10): Wow.  This story is vapid. It starts out promisingly enough-Yuna views a sphere of someone who looks like Tidus, and sets out to find out if the impossible task of ressurecting him can be accomplished. The rest of the story falls apart from there. The vast majority of this \"story\" is made up of mini-games and side-quests.  Now, I like sidquests and mini-games as much as the next person, but there's a reason they have the words \"side\" and \"mini\" in them.  They are supposed to take a back-burner to the main story.  In this game, it's the other way around: the main game is composed of one dull, uninteresting sidequest\/mini-game after another, while the main storyline takes forever to emerge\/develop.  By the time the main story finally got around to being focused on, I no longer cared.\n\nBattle System (6\/10): I had no real qualms with the actual battle mechanic. The system is a variation of turn based that is rather fast -- battles move quickly and your characters move around the field, helping you break out of the \"let's all line up and attack\" feel of previous games (which I actually didn't mind at all).  I must say that the Dress-sphere system itself is actually a rehashed version of the Job system from FFV.  Except in FFV it felt serious and mature-here it feels like you're playing Barbie dress-up.  Also, unlike FFV, you usually need to switch outfits in mid-battle, which slows battle down in an irritating fashion.  Another complaint that brings down the score in this section is the irritating phrases of your characters in battle.  Just listening to Rikku sqeal out another irritating inane phrase makes me cringe.\n\nGameplay (0\/10): If the rest of my review isn't enough for you, here's the final nail in the coffin. I was excited when I heard this game would be non-linear.  I thought it would be like Chrono Cross, where there was a story that you moved through, but certain key decisions (i.e. choose to rescue a character vs. not doing so) made along the way would affect future plot points.  Not so here, it is a mission based system with almost no direction.  The only real effect skipping half the inane crap does is to keep you from getting the perfect ending.  Things as small and pointless as forgetting to talk to one random NPC in chapter 2 could make you miss 1\/2 a point which would prevent you from getting that perfect ending.  The effect of this is that you must follow a guide to the nearest letter, thus ruining any feeling of \"non-linearity\".  Oh, and all those \"fun\" sidequests you'll be doing aren't fun at all.\n\nOverall score (1\/10)- *NOTE that this is not an average, it's my subjective feel of what this game deserves.  As for whether you should rent or buy this, I suggest neither.  In fact, if you're a fan of the original FF10, I suggest you forget this game ever happened.","summary":"A shining example of what happens when you throw together a game using a bunch of negative female stereotypes...","unixReviewTime":1214697600,"vote":"15","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Beinga hardcore gamer myself, and someone who loved its prequel FF 10, I was jumping to buy 10-2.\n\n First off, let me say that this is the only Final Fantasy game I EVER RETURNED! Thats right, i keep all my games, even the average ones. This one however I had to return due to its \"piece of junk-ness\".\n\n FF 10-2 revolves around a trio of girls, 2 of which were characters in the previous FF 10 game. They go off on their adventures doing this, doing that, and in general, you don't really know quite what they are doing. Unlike regular Rpg's where you have a story, and a plot, this game sorta starts with you in your little flying ship able to go everywhere. Its like gigantic minigame. The places you go to don't really have any story, you just land at place A, fight monsters, get some item, and your done. Saying this, there are some awesome mini-games in FF 10-2, which was surprising since most recent Final Fantasy games have failed with minigames.\n\n Now, onto the irritating part. You get to play 3 girls as characters. 3 annoying, teenie-bop girls. Girls who are what, late teens? Except they act like they are 9. They run about saying \"oh poo\" and other similiar phrases. Plus they take baths in skimpy underwear, and massage other girls, and walk about in thongs and skin tight outfits. MMM as a 40 year old gamer, I immensely enjoyed it (NOT!). The game looks like it programmed by experienced Japanese gamers, but created by their 9 year old daughters, and designed by their 11 year old horny sons. To gain abilities and powers you have to change into outfits. Thats right, you change your girl's clothes to gain abilities. And each outfit is tighter and more revealing than the last.\n\n  The game looks beautiful, definitely as great or better graphics as FF 10. But thats all the game excel's at, graphics. No plot, no story, very very bad dialogue and character development (unless you count bra's and thongs as development). There are some very good minigames, and of course the grapics look stunning (did i say that already?). But if you aren't a 11 year old kid, you will hate this game. I couldn't even push my way through the dumb parts, I got disgusted with the game half way through and had to return it for something decent.","summary":"Oh what a letdown from FFX","unixReviewTime":1200009600,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

To speak more clearly, there are some things that you can do only once, if you fail on doing it, you have to reset and retry it, there are people that you can speak with to advance in the percentage and there are people that you should avoid to advance in the percentage, if you speak to somebody you shouldn't in the chapter you'll miss the percentage needed to see what you came looking in this game, then if you miss something you cannot do it again if you're in a different chapter.\n\nIt's confusing the fact that you cannot do everything when you see the people or get the mission, because you've to do some thing in the 3 chapter to get +3% but you can do the same thing in chapter 1 but you'll get 1%.\n\nTo really \"enjoy\" the game, you need a gameguide, TO BE READING ALL THE GAME ALONG (the official one won't serve you by the way), you need something done to get all the percentage, the game has five endings but only one ending that you wan't to see, the 100% ending because the others just suck.\n\nIn conclusion, the traditional talking to people and nice walking around the world is jeopardized by the fact that you're going to screw it talking to somebody you shouldn't until chapter 4 or 3, causing it to give you less percentage or not giving you percentage at all. Those people you saw with bad eyes because they constantly use game guides to beat the games, well you'll become one of them with this game.\n\nTrue FF fans avoid it at all costs, this game sucks big time, just stick to the story of the X and you will remain happy with Yuna and his friends.\n\nPeople of Square, Hironobu Sakaguchi... what where you thinking when you created the percentage system? i can see now why namco is gaining ground on the rpg games.","summary":"Crappy stuff!","unixReviewTime":1167868800,"vote":"4","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

I truly hate this game, but first let me tell you the good points. The graphics are really good, complimented with excellent music. The worlds you travel on are HUGE and expansive, there are so many places to explore. There are tons of items you can aquire, or purchase, I mean tons! Morrowind also does a good job of showing a rich detailed history with lots of non-player characters (NPCs) you will interact with. But the fun ends right there because everything else about this game is garbage! It will clock your Xbox system to the max, you'll hear constant access to the hard drive and cd-drive, the game's performance is horrible; with lots of slow-down and severe drop in framerate. Loading a level takes FOREVER, it has the longest loading time of any Xbox game out there! There is little character speech, so you should expect to do a lot of reading inside the game- lots and lots! PSONE games have way more speech than this! There are tons of useless items you can collect! Just grabbing items is a chore because you have to aim your crosshairs with pin-point accuracy (its a pain just to grab plants or flowers) The animation is like an old Nintendo game! The game controls are sluggish like the framerate! The sound effects are cheap and sparse! The NPCs stand around like fools doing nothing! The NPCs are always rude and annoying \"What do you want?\" \"Stop bothering me\". They will act nice to you only if you give them money (they're all a bunch of gold diggers!).

You dribble the ball away from the cpu player, go near the basket, shoot the ball and score points. Then you have to play defense and try to prevent the cpu player from scoring, but you will see the A.I. always catch-up and surpass your score. It is so fake!

Ever since UbiSoft bought Red Storm Entertainment and started producing the Rainbow Six games themselves the gameplay has changed for the worse, the story lines have become increasingly contrived and obviously written with more concern for political correctness than realism, and the bugs have been out of control.\nThere have been over a dozen patches released for Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield since it's release, and Athena Sword has even more bugs. I have never owned a game which required so many patches.\nThe online play is nowhere near as good as Rogue Spear (although better than Counter Strike, if you prefer realistic tactical shooters to the run-and-gun arcade style games) and the single player campaigns aren't challenging enough to provide more than a few hours of entertainment.\nIf you've already bought Raven Shield and are considering buying Athena Sword, my suggestion would be to wait until the price drops, which is closer to it's actual worth.

Major bugs are commonplace, and the official forum is thriving with hundreds of user requests for bug\/crash help.

The server has been down at one point or another nearly every single day since it opened, and that is nothing....\nA multitude of people have had everything they owned deleted out of the blue, most people have had some significant items deleted at one time or another. It is very hard to move to any new area of town without someone mentioning out loud that they just signed in and 'such-and-such' is now gone.\nCreatures magically disappear when you fight them, usually just before they die so you get no credit for fighting them.

They embraced the \"exploit early, exploit often\" principle, mostly because a number of them play the game online....and also post on the website trashing anyone who has a problem with anything they do (under their player names, which doesn't denote that they are monetarily connected the game to anyone who hasn't happened to get to know them ingame), and delete totally legitimate posts (I have never had one deleted, but many of the ones that get deleted are just being deleted to promote a fraudulent image of the state of the game, which is terrible).\nWorst of all, there are untold numbers of bugs that were known in the beta that made the game completely unplayable, but they chose to ignore so that they could release the game and force the fans of star wars to pay to support it for them (please keep in mind, I play most MMORPGS, this is so far out of the realm of the minute amount other games have done that it makes Shaq-Fu look like viable product).\nThere was 30 days playing time promised on the box.

Having their faulty code damage stats as if armor was on 2 or 3 times over when no armor was on (making some stats negative :P) and insuring anything that touched you would kill you in 1 hit until the next day (or longer sometimes) when they would finally shake it off your character. Crashing for no reason and killing your character in the process, world comes back up an hour (or day, or 2) later and your character has huge wounds that force you to sit around in a hospitol for up to an hour...WHEEEEE. Deleting all your equipment and your money so you run around with starter gear trying to get money is real fun then. Having havesters dissapear with a weeks worth of gathering in them. Having entire suits of top grade armor regularly disappear when they are bought.

Maybe they can never dream up more creative ways of generating suspense and mystery other than the ol' \"Who am I?\"  XIII's main character is so devoid of colour, so boringly voiced and humourless, that even if the game itself were fun, the very fact that you have to play as an utter nerd for a main character just cripples the experience.\n\nBut this game isn't fun, either.  Half of this game is an example of just how horribly wrong a stealth game can be when the elements aren't right.\n\nAs a shooter this game fares somewhat better, but not much more.  Enemies strafe even faster than you and reloading takes forever, and their shots are so accurate that taking cover doesn't really help.  This game is also extremely stingy about giving you ammo (an average enemy drops maybe two shotgun shells and 10-20 bullets).  Frustrating, but at least there's action.  The stealth part, on the other hand, is plain garbage for a couple of reasons:\n\n- Who came up with the idea of helmets?  I can't remember another single stealth game where a headshot doesn't kill an enemy.  In fact, the very concept of stealth games is impossible without headshot kills -- unless you have alternate methods of distracting or killing the enemy (Metal Gear Solid's choke\/neck-break and noise distractions, for example).\n\n- I don't know where main character \"Number XIII\" learned how to shoot, because even un-helmeted enemies seldom die with a headshot.  I've tested this by activating an invincibility cheat code, walking straight up to an enemy, and blasting him in the face.  Nope, still alive and kicking.\n\n- No radar.  The \"sixth sense\" in this game which is supposed to replace this basic function is useless, because it tells you where enemies are by means of the \"tap, tap\" of approaching footsteps.  Which means you won't be able to spot an enemy who's a foot to your right, just offscreen.\n\n- When special events occur, they use a \"window-in-window\" technique which is interesting visually (a comic-book device), but unhelpful to the player.  You don't know where these events take place in relation to your current location.  And sometimes, you hear an important conversation that's somewhere in your vicinity, but the game doesn't tell you where it's coming from.\n\nGive me No One Lives Forever anyday, if first-person stealth\/action shooters are your thing.  Cate Archer can kick \"Number XIII\"'s butt any day, and say more interesting things along the way.  I bought XIII from the bargain bin and wish I'd gotten myself a nice dinner instead.

That's exactly how I felt after finishing this final chapter of .hack. A series that began full of promise has done little except disappoint me.\nYou all know about the series, so I'll forego the plot summary. A lot of people have played apologist for this series, answering the valid complaint of, \"Why are ALL the games the same?\" with a variety of sophistries, but the fact is, this game has little invention in it.\nI was disappointed in part two because of the ridiculous length of the game (it took me about nine hours). Part three answered this problem, and also had some nice bonuses (such as searching for ghosts of the series characters and finding items for trading), and I was eagerly anticipating part four.\nSo what's the problem here? Not length; this game may be the longest of the bunch (although, it still only clocked in at about 23 hours; I like a little more meat on my RPG's). The gameplay is the same, but hey, that's what we've come to expect. No, the problem here is story, in that this game has little. Most of the questions you might have asked, most of the theories you might have postulated concerning The World won't be answered here. The end of the game (which, though I thought about it, I will not spoil here) is quite unsatisfactory  (ho-hum is the best word I can use to describe it), and in the end, this whole series (which, if you purchased new, will run you around two hundred bucks) left me feeling like I was cheated out of one hundred and fifty dollars.

It was encompassing, awe inspiring, it had varied levels, it was pretty non-linear, the levels were lengthy yet doable.  It was basically a fun all around game.  So Jak 2 comes out, and they made a lot of changes, all for the worse.\nFirst off, I guess the marketing folks told the developers to emulate Grand Theft Auto 3.  Let me tell you, this does not work.  GTA had a living-breathing city that fit into the environment.  What does Jak 2 have?  It was a non-descript closed off city with hardly anything in it.  The worst is the movement throughout the city.  To go to a different a different part of the city, you need take this horrible \"hover vehicle\" that apparently can't hover beyond \"up\" or \"down\".  The movements of this vehicle are sluggish, slow, and uncontrollable, and the vehicle itself doesn't possess any subtlety.  Couple this with the fact that all the missions are clear cross the city, and the alleyways are small, and you've got one boring, annoying game.  I passed maybe 10 levels, and most of my time was spent hovering between those levels.\nSecondly, in GTA fashion, they decided to make it \"gritty\".  Oh geez, give me a break.  Who was begging for a cartoon platformer to be gritty?  Why does Jak need to cuss?  I don't mind it, but it serves no other purpose other than to alienate a chunk of potential gamers.  The \"gritty\" factor might have been an excuse as to why they could not re-produce the lush, varied environments that really made the first game.  Every level I played looked the same, either an indoor level or an outdoor level.\nOkay, so the environment and movement is no good, what about the missions you say?  Well, these missions are tedious missions and designed to be repeated over and over again.  Some of the missions are easy, but you basically go through the same jumps and enemies over and over again.  Many are difficult, made so that you have to die a few times, repeat what you just accomplished, just to die a little bit later.  While not hard, but if the missions were any fun, it wouldn't be so bad.\nFinally, the first game required you to reach a certain number of spheres for you to pass.  Whatever way you wanted to get them, you could.  This meant that if a mission was boring, not fun, or out of the way, you could skip and try something else.  This game pretty much is linear.  It's sort of de-evolution of video gaming right here.\nSo, in short, what was once an original, fun, lush platform game now spawned a sequel which is no more than a badly designed conglomeration or random gaming ideas.\nPros:\nUhmm, I can't think of any.\nCons:\nPretty much linear.\nCity is mundane.\nEnvironments unvaried, stale.\nRepetitive, tedious levels.\nAdult for no reason.\nHover system is mind boggling bad.\nDifficulty: Medium\nFrustration Level: High\nHours to complete (my estimate): 25 Hours","summary":"ONE MAJOR STEP BACKWARDS!!!","unixReviewTime":1068768000,"vote":"14","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Plus, it was cheap.\n\nThis RPG game is only \"extreme\" in how bad it is...  The difficulty in this game comes from a completely random, roulette wheel battle style, and the fact that every challenge in the game require level 30+ skills to overcome, when you're at level 2.  Seriously, you will encounter a barrel, a door, or a treasure chest and not be able to do anything, right at the beginning of the game.  You later find out it takes a level 30 skill to break or open anything.\n\nSo, you walk around what is basically a board game playing field, moving a stationary character drawing one space at a time, while random pictures flash in the background.  Occasionally you get in a random battle, which is where the roulette attack wheel comes in.  All your skills are put on a fast spinning wheel, and what you land on is what you do.\n\nOr, you encounter a trap.  If this happens, you use the same wheel to try and avoid it, which it early levels, is something like a 1\/19 odds.\n\nThe battles present another huge problem.  You have your standard HP, and you have LP.  LP is your life points, and if a character is attacked while in KO (after HP reaches 0, typically) you lose an LP, and when LP is gone, you're dead for real.  You get shocking little LP... like 2 or 3 at most... which wouldn't be too much of a problem except tiny monsters in random battles do LP damage while you still have full HP!  So, at full HP, a 2 hit kill monster can hit you for an unavoidable 2 LP... possibly killing a character.  This makes HP completely useless...\n\nI never found an item that could cure LP, either.\n\nThere are multiple characters you can play, with different storylines.  A good feature, but the stories (played out through a very few still picture\/word sequences) were bland and confused, and none of them sparked my interest enough to possibly warrent played through such an unfun wreck of a game.\n\nNot even worth the incredibly cheap price and shipping.  Stay away.\n\nIf you want an \"extreme\" or challenging RPG with great story, great gameplay try the Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne or Digital Devil Saga series.","summary":"One of the worst games I've played...","unixReviewTime":1137196800,"vote":"6","style":null,"image":null}

I gave up after about 4 hours of play and decided I wasn't getting it.  I tried again a month later and lasted 10 hours, still thought that there might be something that I didn't understand.  My last try was about 15 hours, and I can state unequivocally that there is nothing to get.  This is not a good game, not even a mediocre one, for that matter.\nPerhaps the single most glaring flaw is the non-existent animation.  Outside of some cut scenes and so-so battle action this is in what Square Enix calls \"sketch motion\" which means - no motion at all.  So help me, one character's sketch appears with a balloon of text, then another, then...  Throw in a barebones mapping facility that does the travel and you have the entire art effort.  This isn't a game, it's a prototype for one.\nThe battle system is almost as bad.  You have to set up all your characters' moves ahead of time, one painstaking button press at a time.  Then, when the action actually starts you have to hit a button while a battle wheel spins.  Most of your opponents actually die of boredom.\nThe story line is doled out in bite-sized bits but what I've seen is pretty run of the mill.  Playing Unlimited Saga is actually painful, as you follow a set of meaningless actions using a game structure that was out of style in 1995.  the best I can say about is that Square Enix must have cancelled the game before the animation, and has published it to try to recoup their investment.\nUnless you collect total failures, pass this one by.","summary":"Expletives Deleted","unixReviewTime":1071273600,"vote":"46","style":null,"image":null}

I'm probably one of the most diehard RPG fans out there, but Unlimited Saga? This game is a disgrace! I ordered it off amazon and thankfully it did not ship properly. So I played it at my friends house.\n  I would first like to point out the graphics. The anime style animation is a good idea, but not here. As soon as you start up the game you will have a hard time looking at it. The graphics are all cartoon!\n  Moving around is another problem. You don't move! You point in what direction you want to go, and the screen changes. To me that is a whole chunk of RPG that is gone. And to move around in towns, you press X on the house you want to enter and your there.\n  The battles. Oh geez the battles. Interesting yet boring. You can choose up to 7 attacks to use on one turn using all your characters. You can also pick a small number of abilities. Then you are done and this spinning reel thing shows up. You stop it and attack, either kicking, punching or throwing.......thats about it. Oh, and the enemy attacks!\n  Next is sound. Thsi category isn't that bad. The sounds and music are wonderful. The music being very original and colorful. The voice acting is very poorly done however. There might be 3 characters on the screen and suddenly a voice pops up. You can't really tell who it is, mostly because its a cartoon and their lips don't move.\n  I'm always bummed to see very bad RPG's. They are a waste of money, and you don't really have fun with them. Unlimited Saga could have been great. Spice up the graphics, add a new battle system, and hire the FFX voice people and this game is golden. Sorry Square, but you've built a boat with no paddle.\n  Take my word for it and don't buy this game. Its not like Square to make a RPG like this.

They are all great games.\n\nWhen it was announced a PC version of Temple of Elemental Evil, I was very excited. I remember the the thrill playing, and then DMing the PnP version of the game some 15 years ago.\n\nAnd THIS is what they come up with?!? Crap!\n\n1. Bugs. After installing the three official patches the game is still bug-ridden: clicking on a character brings up the inv. of another, spells don't work, desktop crashing, numerous clipping issues (which is very rare in 2D game), an interface that seem to do the exact opposite of what you want it to do. etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc.\n\n2. Tedious. The D & D 3.5 rules does not translate into a computer game. At all. It is that simple. In the Baldurs gate series the game play was fast, intuitive. exciting. In ToEE its a big yawn.\n\nThe Homlet quest are, with two exceptions, dumb, boring and errand boyish: Tell X to bring me a turnip, get a hammer for the blacksmith, tell X that Y really likes her, play cards with some bum at the inn.

If I wanted an exact copy of it on PC, I'd still be ticked off about wasting $50 on this pice of garbage.  I wanted a bit more \"pc game\" out of this pc game.  This game delivers when it comes to it's adherence to the 3.5 rule set and formulae, but as a video game it is a piece of junk.  D&D fans would be better served by investing in the latest books and playing the traditional way.\nThe graphics are god-awful.  The background environment in the entire game is 2D.  This game may have been on par in 1999 with the then current level of graphic complexity, but it came out at the end of 2002, when Neverwinter Nights had already been on the market for some time.  NWN graphics were and are far superior.  In fact, Baldur's Gate II graphics are\/were far superior. I dare say I believe BG ONE had better graphics.\nBuggy?  This game put a whole new meaning to the term \"buggy\".  It crashes.  And it crashes.  And it crashes some more.  Despite the garbage gui, it still slows to a grinding halt even on my up-to-date pc. Even with the patch I have yet to be able to complete this game.\nSupport?  You won't get any from the producers of this crap-fest.  In the words of the head honcho, \"...I like to put the [completed games] behind me and move on to the next project...\"  I've been keeping track.  A second patch, which is supposed to fix the problems the first patch either missed, or created anew, has been promised for over a year.  Release dates are promised, then the developers just disappear for a time.  No, I don't ever suspect I'll ever be ableto finish this game.\nLinear.  Probably the most linear RPG created in the past 6 years.  You get no opportunity to explore the world...mainly because it doesn't exist.  Despite the games strict adherance to the D&D 3.5 rules, it doesn't even give you remotely the same experience as TOEE gave when played on PnP.  The side quests are a joke.  They are the worst example of fedex I can think of.  \"Go tell him I said OK  I'll wait here.\"  \"He said OK.\" \"Tell him I said I like OK, I'll wait here.\"  \"He said he likes OK.\"  \"Good.

I use it strictly for Star Wars Galaxy. This stick is fantastic for the JTL content.  The buttons are easily mapped and stick is stiff, but responsive. Perfect for PVP.  My gripe though seems to be a common one after doing a lot of homework on way my ship was constantly rolling to the left. The twist function within the joystick doesn't seem to be durable as I've had to set up a return order.  Now this is where I really am annoyed.\n\nLogitech, one of the largest accessory companies has been absolutely horrible about the claim I filed.  I've been waiting days on end for a response and was forced to go go back to amazon.com to see what they'd suggest.  To my surprise, Amazon went and ok'd the return due to the manufacturer not being supportive.  Big Kudos to Amazon.\n\nOverall: maybe I just got a bad joy..  I really like the stick during the first few months of ownership. It's comfortable and ofters a wide variety of buttons that's convenient for your casual flyer. I've seen other sticks with separate throttle and buttons on this, but to be honest, i'm a lazy pilot and I don't want to have to figure out 2 controls vs having everything on one package. If something could be done about the poor durability for the twist function,  I think you would have a product, but like I said, maybe it's just a defective joy.\n\nUPDATE:  11\/14 -- Upon ordering a replacement, that was fulfilled by Amazon.com for a new replacement. I received a clunky oversized box and the joystick in a bag. No packing materials like popcorn. Needless to say, being livid is an understatement.  It's busted too.  Amazon has issued a refund for #2.\n\nHonestly...  Don't buy this.

Again, such people are either idiots or work for the company.\nNow, onto, Dark Alliance.  I have played the original Baldur's Gate on the p.c. and have played the first video game version of Baldur's Gate on both the Playstation and the X-box.  All of these games I found very enjoyable and would give them between 3-4 stars.\nBaldur's Gate: Dark Alliance deserves one star.  While the graphics are good, they are not as good as the first game and the makers have an annoying habit of making you fight in the dark to (1) make gameplay more difficult (pretty hard to fight when you can't see) and (2) to mask the fact that the graphics are mostly reused from the first game.\nLittle effort went into originality on this game.  The story is incredibly week.  You play an entirely different character from the first game.  Your character has some secret or mystery that must be completed that differentiates him or her from the other characters.  Once you find out your secret or solve your mystery you will be disappointed because of the anticlimactic reaction of your character and your inability to use the information you gained.\nNot all monsters (including bosses) give good or any treasures.\nAll monsters are incredibly easy to beat (you only need to press one button over and over again to beat 90% of the monsters) with one exception.  Toward the end of the game you will need to reach the two baddest bad guys.  Right before you meet them you ascend a stair case directly into a room filled with monsters who kill you immediately.  This part of the game was insanely difficult unless you have stealth.\nOverall, a disappointing game with few, if any, highlights.

I read the min requirements before I buy it...which is absolutely deceiving.\nFirst row will be the system requirement for the game, second row will be what I have.\n733 hmz processer  |  3.2 GHZ\n1.2 GB hard drive space  |  65 GB free\n32 MB video card | 128 MB Geforce II\n128 MB ram  |  512 MB\n_So I get it and install it on my computer.  Theoretically, this game should fly on it's best settings.  Especially because I see the graphics, and I have larger games with better graphics that run perfectly smooth.  But what happens?  I get into the game, and I think it's paused because I try to move and nothing happens.  12 seconds later, I'm suddenly in a new spot.  Serious, serious lag time.\n_Dissapointed that the game isn't running on highest graphics settings, I decide to put it on lowest, and progress higher until I find a comfortable medium.  Well...the game doesn't even run on minimum settings.  It runs better, but not at any playable speeds.  Clocked at about 1 frame \/ 5 seconds.\n_I figure there may have been some coding error in the game, so I connect and download a patch from microsoft.  I was almost correct.  The game runs now at 2\/frames per second.  So, I'm a lot closer to playable than I used to be, but it's still unplayable.  Wasted money.\n_I try multiplayer, thinking that perhaps it is just the campaign mode that's bad.  But it isn't.  Multiplayer is just as bad, though thankfully not worse.  You'll be happy to know, though, that once you get killed and your carcass is falling to the ground, there is no lag at all!  THAT runs perfectly smoothly.  However, I played a 45 minute game OL, and never got to leave my base.  There were 3 snipers around the base, in an 8 vs 8 game.  And I had a bullet through my head as soon as I respawned.  Lag wouldn't kick in for about 3 seconds, so I tried to run, but alas cheap cowardly idiots had me and 6 others of my team constantly dead...with progressively longer respawn times, of course.  Interesting how I never got to leave my respawn point, or even my base area.  I'm told this is par for Halo, so even the multiplayer I wanted to partake in was flawed.  The servers are chocked full of cheap snipers.\n_Don't get me wrong.  Snipers are fine if you're defending your flag or a strategic point for your team or whatnot.  But...when you kill the enemy within their own base AS they respawn...that's going overboard.  There should be a system where if you snipekill a person within 3 seconds of them respawning, you get killed and have to sit out for 5 minutes.  Because, newsflash, those people are there so they can play, not die where they spawn and watch the clock tick away how long they have until they can rejoin.\n_I know I sound crazy, but the only possible way a smaller game with horrid graphics can run that badly is deliberate sabatoge of the code.  Microsoft, I'm sure, did this to prevent TOO many purchases of the PC version, and help out it's Xbox by keeping it's only good title more afloat.  So, for now I search OL to find someone who's hacked the code and made it playable.\n_I see a man selling bootleg Microsoft software every day on my way to work.  I never respected him for what he does.  The day after I got Halo, I walked up to him, shook his hand, and donated $50 to his cause.  Told him, \"Good job\", and caught my bus.\n_This game just isn't worth the web space to trash talk it.","summary":"Sabatoge and deceit","unixReviewTime":1078963200,"vote":"5","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

It offers both single player and online multiplay.\nIf you love multiplayer games and have a broadband connection...this game is awesome. WARNING - Most of the Halo Multiplayer servers, groups and games I played were filled with immature 14 year olds that curse 4 letter words at you and accuse you of cheating all the time because they can't shoot straight. I prefer more mature surroundings!\nIf you are looking for a great single player experience...forget it.\nFirst of all the graphics are pretty...but dated. Look at UT 2003 on a high end vid card and compare it to Halo. Halo is bland, the levels are redundant. The outside levels are pretty but nothing impressive.\nEven on the hardest settings this game is way too scripted, the enemy AI is pathetic and predictable. It is not intelligent AI. All the programmers did was setup scripted actions and triggers to generate hoardes and hoardes of enemies to come at you at set intervals as you proceed through a level.\n\nWant to beat them easily? Say your in a level exploring...just walk slowly until you trigger some enemies to appear, back track a bit for protection and keep your back to a wall. Kill the enemies as they approach, then step back to where you triggered the enemies, see if you can trigger more and repeat these instructions until you are clear. Proceed and investigate further until you trigger more enemies. Repeat this strategy throughout the level and the rest of the game.\nIf you get into a heated, heavy battle, just use cover...pop out, shot some aliens and duck again. They almost never pursue you. Only the weird, mutants chase you. Just shotgun them. Nice and simple.\nThere are some tiny little parasite style aliens that are more annoying than dangerous. Don't waste your ammo on them, just let them crash into your shield, let your shield recharge and proceed. PIECE OF CAKE. I walked through this game on the hardest settings, without breaking a sweat, the AI is disappointing. Not horrible, but very PREDICTABLE.\nOnline Multiplay is where this game shines...the weapons are so-so...but having vehicles to drive around is a blast.\nIf you are thinking of buying this title...I would wait.

Yes, the levels were repetitive, but the combat was revolutionary!  For those of you that don't know - the XBOX joystick has (among other buttons) 2 thumbsticks (one for each thumb).  Halo was the first FPS for the XBOX - so the Bungie programmers had to decide what these two joysticks controlled.  They chose so well that countless other programmers have copied them, and those that didn't - wish they had!  One thumbstick controls the motion of your character based upon the direction he is looking.  The other joystick controls which direction the character looks.  Did I mention that the Xbox jostick has triggers for both of your index fingers?  Within 10 minutes of playing Halo on the XBOX - I was pretty good.  Within 48 hours - I was one lethal trash-talking Marine!  I have two problems with the PC version.  First, let me prefix this by stating that I am running Halo on a P4 2.4-HyperThreaded\/800MHz FSB\/512MB\/XP Pro\/Nvidia GeForceFX 5600 Ultra 128MB.  Suffice it to say that I should be able to play EVERYTHING (expect for DOOM 3) at the highest detail level while having processing power to spare.  Guess what?  When playing Halo for the PC and there are more than 2 aliens on the screen - my system begins to crawl under the strain.  This is in the very beginning - imagine what will happen when I reach THE FLOOD (hundreds of aliens at a time)?  This is unacceptable.  But it is a shame that somebody messed-up Halo PC, because there will be gamers that will never know how awesome the game really is.  My second problem is actually more of a realization.  I now realize that Halo was so revolutionary because of the two-thumbstick\/trigger controller.  It is extremely intuitive to control movement with one thumb while looking with the other thumb while firing your weapons with actual triggers.  The keyboard cannot begin to compete.  I read a review on a reputable gaming website that basically stated the exact opposite - he loved Halo on the keyboard.  To each his own - I guess.  Make up your own mind, but I suggest each of you just try it on the Xbox for 10 minutes to see \"what all the fuss is about!\"","summary":"Majorly loved it on the XBOX.  Less so on the PC.

On my Multimedia super killer Dell wide screen notebook with the new Pentium M processor, Nvidia FX 5650 Go Video with 128 mb video RAM and 1 gig of main memory, Halo performance is abysmal.\nI figured the others who said this may have been a bit over the top. They werent! For Microsoft to have released this piece of drek is irresponsible in the extreme. It is the full Halo game and if you set to the higher resolutions, the scenery is Gorgeous, But, But, But!\nUnfortunately, even with virtually all the pretty video features turned off and resolution set down to an abysmal 800x600, the massive frame rate (and motion update) slowing (to as bad as less than 1 frame per second) that takes place whenever major scene motion occurs (especially in the middle of gunfights and always during in battle reloading). Make the game practically unplayable. I completed Halo on the Xbox in Normal and Heroic mode. But the PC version in standard mode is going to be a real challenge because the frame rate and sluggish mouse update are so bad. Really, Really Bad.\nThere were things that could have been done to fix these issues before release, but lets face it with Halo2 looming, Microsoft had to dump it out here now to have any chance of selling it at all. Half Life works on the PC and has a truly excellent interface. They do use lower resolution figures and scenery, but the whole thing works together.

But by the time this one came out, I had either lost interest or couldn't be bothered to spend money on buying it.\n\nWhere the previous game was smooth, streamlined, and somewhat tempered in its hacking n slashing so that hacking and slashing half a dozen opponents was overwhelming yet rewarding in a way that some hack n slashes do with half a hundred opponents in the same time.  It had the original voice actors playing themselves, even unlockable interviews with them talking about it and their recording.  It even had incentives to replay levels using each character over again.\n\nNine years later, I returned to the games, and played this one.\n\nEverything about the previous game that was good seems to be completely and thoroughly wasted or rendered useless in this game.\n\nThe graphics are somewhat improved for the characters, but the drab color scheme (a questionable decision given that this game covers more areas and different characters) and stunningly awful enemy designs mean that while you could easily discern Orcs from Goblins from Uruk-Hai, including the big orcs who were like Uruk-Hai, and the incredibly annoying Uruk-Hai with no shirt who would always knock you down with his one-handed sword, in this game you can almost never tell the difference (if there even is any) between the various types of Orc.\n\nAdding to the monotony of the color is perhaps the most mind-numbingly awful methods of ramping up gameplay difficulty from the previous game.  Virtually every bad game design decision that could be implemented here was implemented;\n\n- The camera positioning is hideous and you frequently end up being unable to see your own character for long periods of time, or running headlong against the side of the screen, only to be suddenly attacked at the last moment by a horde of enemies you were apparently charging straight into blindly.\n\nSome specific examples include the wall battle of Minas Tirith, a pretty blatant copy of the wall battle of Helms Deep from the previous game, only this time with you as Gandalf and with constant annoying little secondary objectives that give the enemy far too much time to swarm the wall, such as rushing to catapults to fire on enemy siege towers, despite them ALREADY HAVING TEAMS OF MEN AT THE CATAPULTS FULLY CAPABLE OF PULLING THE SWITCH TO FIRE.  The camera angling is so terrible that you can never actually see the staircase you're supposed to walk up to find the catapults.  The game never even hints how you get to them, and it was literally only dumb luck that I found the camera shifted when I reached a certain blind spot, showing me these stairs.\n\nAnother horrendous example comes when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli arrive on Pelennor Fields, and must go through a gauntlet of taking out Oliphaunts one at a time.  Aside from the afore-mentioned face-palming stupidity exercise that this is, the game constantly goes to cut scene to show you the arrival of each and every single new Oliphaunt, as well as the Witch-King arriving, thus leaving your character frozen in place while random Uruks and Eastern Men swarm your position; if you had virtually no health (and you almost certainly will) you pretty much instantly die as soon as the cutscene is done.  And the way the cutscene is shot makes it difficult to tell which side of a massive canyon you should be on in order to shoot at the Oliphaunt.\n\n- Ridiculous difficulty levels involving health and damage.  At the very least for this game, you can purchase combo and weapon upgrades that apply to ALL characters rather than you own, with a discount to offer incentive toward this while having a need to keep upping your best characters to meet future challenges.  Despite this, difficulty isn't raised by having smarter opponents or tougher battles, but simply by lowering your health drastically and lowering your weapon damage drastically, then by doubling the amount of enemies thrown at you.\n\nWhereas the previous game's health bar was well balanced with its green for good, yellow for mildly damaged, orange for seriously damaged, and red for near-death, and a good player almost always managing to keep yellow or better, no amount of skill will keep players from spending more than half the time in red health, bordering on dying.  This wouldn't be so frustrating if not for the fact that the game seemingly doesn't expect this, and thus has the health bar constantly FLASHING at the bottom of the screen when you're in red.\n\nThis is exacerbated by incredibly bad combos.  Despite using some of the same button sequences as the previous game, combos here are poorly executed, with some of the most important ones being so slow in execution that they only work against an opponent one on one; if there is a second opponent, he need only shove you roughly to completely break the combo and send you staggering back.  This means combos are as likely to fail as they are to work properly, and even worse, don't do enough damage to kill most of the time; when there's few, if any combos that allow for sweeping attacks or splash damage, knocking one opponent down for a second before moving on to another is just as much a waste of time as simply mashing A repeatedly, with the exact same results achieved.\n\nAt the very least, you can block attacks with your attack instead of having to press B constantly (though this works best).  And even worse is being knocked down; unlike the previous game, when you're knocked down by ANYTHING (be it a gargantuan Orc champion, a troll, or a dog-sized spider) you stay down for 3 full seconds, unmoving, and take another 2-3 seconds just getting up.  In the midst of fast-hack-n-slash gameplay, particularly in the Pelennor Fields where 6 seconds is long enough to miss your chance to kill the Oliphaunt and spook the Witch King away from Merry and Eowyn, this is deadly, not to mention a colossal waste of time with regards to action.  I cannot even imagine how this decision to make rising such a sluggish action was considered and implemented unless there's a future upgrade to speed up rising time (though about 50% of the way into the game, it's not anywhere to be seen).\n\n- Long-winded missions with multiple sub-objectives and poorly spaced out checkpoints.\n\nThis section alone topples the entire game, in my opinion.  It is absolutely gamebreaking and the true definition of \"an exercise in face-palming stupidity\"\n\nThe Two Towers' missions were typically lengthy, with frequent checkpoints and clear-cut objectives, like \"Kill 40 Uruk-Hai, run this way to protect Frodo, kill 10 Uruk-Hai, kill Uruk boss\", it was mostly about rushing through maze-like levels, killing, doing stuff, killing, and boss fights.\n\nHere, they implement so many sections that in some cases bring the gameplay to a screeching halt so you can try and fail over and over to figure out their completely pointless little puzzle section, or try and fail over and over as they throw complicated objectives on top of being swarmed by hundreds of opponents.\n\nSome of the absolute worst examples include:\n\nSamwise in Shelob's lair.  There are little sections that serve absolutely no purpose except to waste time, in which Sam has to pick up a conveniently placed torch and throw it in the middle of a pile of little spiders in order to clear them from his path.  Rather than just using it once or twice to teach us to use the Z button for interactions, they implement it as a primary level feature, and there's literally one section where you have to do it three times in a row to reach a locked door, only to realize YOU HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN GOING BACK WHERE YOU STARTED in order to climb up past ANOTHER series of spiders and torches.\n\nThe Big Three in the Ghost lair.  More than once, you're forced to button-mash the Z button to turn a wheel that lowers a bridge while ghostly archers shoot at you, balancing between deflecting their arrows and working on the bridge.  Not only is this so easy that you could just stand there as half the arrows simply glitch past you due to piss-poor collision detection, but sometimes a cutscene showing the bridge lowering wastes several seconds.\n\nOther times, the game simply demands ridiculously over the top objectives and gives you literally nothing to work with.  In these circumstances, even lowering the difficulty does nothing to change the impenetrable grind in some of these levels.  The design is not one of any sort of challenge or skill or talent, but literally face-palming stupidity and repetition until you finally overcome the odds by sheer statistics.  It's the very action of the saying \"the definition of insanity is doing the exact same thing over and over and expecting different results\".  And unlike the previous game, your allies are completely and utterly useless; they will never ever successfully kill more than one enemy in the time you've taken out five or six or more and moved on.  Sometimes they won't even attack, but just stand still in front of an enemy until that enemy decides to ignore them and attack you.\n\nSome of the worst offenders include the aforementioned level in the Ghost cave, where you inexplicably have to fight some ghosts.  Random rocks will burst out of the ground, blocking your progress until you defeat a bunch of ghosts somehow.  As well, if you get too close to the ghosts, they can pretty much insta-kill you, sending you right the hell back to the start of the level or the start of the checkpoint.  There's literally nothing you can do to avoid this but try again and do the exact same thing over again.\n\nSimilarly, the aforementioned Pelennor Fields gauntlet of \"I have to do everything because everyone else is too effing stupid\" tasks, in which to start, you have to kill 60 east men, but not Orcs.  I specifically say not Orcs, because they don't count towards the 60, and because there's as many of them on the field as there are east men.  Why east men only instead of Orcs, no effing idea why, since the overall objective means you could be fighting wild deer or gremlins or inanimate objects and the result as well as the task would be exactly the same; killing these 60 eastermen doesn't matter at all; the respawn infinitesimally and after you finish this pointless objective, you move on to the real mission.\n\nAnd this \"warm up\" isn't even vital to the actual mission; you could literally just run past the field and set up camp on the cliffs overlooking the canyon where the Oliphaunts spawn, but the combination of pointless objective and incredibly awful camera angling means you're literally lost in the fray and have no idea where to even go once you've finished the objective.\n\nAnd the sheer number of Orcs and East Men spawned and thrown at you in this phase makes it so difficult that it should be in some way relevant; I've died and had to restart so often in this spot, I could have finished entire levels of this same long-winded game in the amount of time I spent dealing with flimsy combos which left me wide open to attack by the 50,000 other enemies surrounding me, being knocked over long enough for another 50,000 to trample me, and spending so much time with red blinking health on the brink of death while mashing B to block 50,000 blades all attacking me that I could reach Perfect Mode two times over just from the blocks, and have no avenue open to even attack anyone!  ALL of those events (aside from the obvious number exaggeration) happened to me in this one effing level!!!\n\nAnd the punchline is; this isn't the first time you're put in such a situation.  An earlier level has the exact same setup; you randomly thrown into a random spot of battlefield with endless swarms of Orcs spawning on you, and half an hour spent blocking and killing them by the score, with no end in sight, and no mission objective in sight.  Unlike the Pelennor Fields one where you at least saw it would end after killing 60 East Men, this level (forgot which) had NO such objective, and NO clue or insight into what you were supposed to be doing!\n\nIF you survived long enough, the mission would end up failing anyway because apparently you were supposed to go and rescue someone while fighting through the Orcs.  This WOULD have made sense if the Orcs were actually IN BETWEEN YOU AND THE THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REACH.  Instead, they're literally on the EXACT OPPOSITE SIDE, so the way to complete this objective is not to fight your way through the Orcs, but to COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM AND RUN AWAY.  And you only learn this AFTER being killed half a dozen times or having the mission abruptly fail with absolutely no explanation as to why.\n\nBack to the Pelennor Fields level, another layer of insanity\/stupidity comes with the Witch King; he randomly appears to fly over Eowyn and Merry and apparently do nothing.  They take damage, but the Witch King neither attacks them nor shoots arrows or spears or magic at them.  You're supposed to shoot arrows at him to make him fly away.  Not only does this occur while the Oliphaunts still come (and taking them down is a tedium all in itself) but if the Oliphaunts make it to Eowyn and Merry, you instantly fail the mission, and the amount of time it takes to move from different locations and fire off arrows means that there are some cases where it is genuinely not possible to win the mission, because you missed out by a second or less getting up after being knocked down, and either the Witch King or an Oliphaunt kills Merry and Eowyn.\n\nAnd making it even more catastrophically infuriating is that Orcs and East Men KEEP SPAWNING THIS WHOLE TIME and they KEEP rushing at you to attack you!  So sometimes you don't even need to be just a bit too slow; you could be distracted by them rushing you, wasting your time, while the Oliphaunt trudges closer, or the Witch King kills off Eowyn and Merry.\n\nAnd this literally happens to me every time: When I try to target the Witch King to shoot arrows at him, ONE enemy soldier spots me and rushes at me... and my bow's targetting targets HIM instead of the Witch King, and thus far I've found absolutely nothing short of completely putting the bow away and killing him that will serve to take the bow's aim OFF the goddamn bat and ON the goddamn Witch King.\n\nAt this rate, it seems impossible for the game to present anything that could lift it out of this mad mess of pointless wall-banging repetition and stupidity.  It's become for me the go-to guide on how not to make an action game.

I have played every single mission and beat them with flying colors. The original was the greatest. It had everything from sneaking into a German facility, wearing an SS unform, to the invasion of Omaha Beach. MOHAA was original, yet very realistic.\nSpearhead sort of strayed from this when it had you, an American paratrooper with the 101st Airborne Division jump into Normandy and find yourself fighting alongside British soldiers, and then a short time after that in Berlin with the Russians. You had a chance to use the new weapons of these countries, but it seemed too staged to be real.\nBreakthrough completely broke through my long-time respect for the Medal of Honor legacy. You did the same old thing you did in Spearhead, but in Italy. Realism took a turn for worse as the developers tried to make you feel surrounded. But, what happens is enemy troops will literally appear out of nowhere. Another problem I found was that they NEVER give you enough ammo...And don't say I waste, because I've never ran into this problem before. Also, not to mention the idiotic mission plots and objectives. The third or so mission requires you to liberate a fully-functional and guarded German POW camp in Italy. Not so bad, eh? It requires you to do so ALL BY YOURSELF. And furthermore, by the time I reached it, I had no ammo left. This wasn't any fluke, either. It's happened to me many times in Breakthrough.\nI think the best advice I can give to you is, \"Don't waste your money.\" This is not the Medal of Honor you know and love. It is an attempt to prolong the Medal of Honor series that, as you know, is fading away. This is just the same old stuff, folks...

First of all, the graphics are horrible for a fps of its time. The graphics are actually worse than Frontline's! Not only do the graphics suck, but so does the AI and the gameplay.\nThe game was extremely linear. You are confined to only one direct approach for every mission: Run down the only (and most obvious) path and frag every mentally-challenged Jap in your way.(Think of this game as playing the first Mario Bros. except Mario is replaced by a GI with a gun. And goombas are Japs.) This game is for single-minded people who enjoy playing games which have no depth whatsoever.\nThe AI of this game is horrible. For example, one time I left Gunny behind, and he crossed paths with a Japanese soldier while trying to catch up with me. The Japanese soldier stabbed him with a bayonet about 50 times, but Gunny didn't care because he was so intent on getting to where I was. He just kept trying to run throught the Jap while he was getting stabbed.(Gunny never died either)\nAnother thing that irkes me is that EA made every single enemy have the same death animation. The guy that you clubbed with your pistol dies in the exact same fashion as the guy who recieved a direct hit from a bazooka or hand grenade.\nI could go on an on about how bad this game is, but that would take a year at least. First person shooters are getting quite advanced these days, and Rising Sun just does not live up to the standards of other fps' like Halo or even the first half-life.\nTo sum it up, Rising Sun is a low budget, linear, boring game with no replay value. I feel bad for my uncle for going out and spending his time and money to get me this game for Christmas.  Any person with an IQ of 5 could beat this game within a day.","summary":"For single-minded, little kids only.","unixReviewTime":1090972800,"vote":"4","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Okay, for those who know nothing about the series, it's a sub series in the Mega Man franchise. The sub-series began on the Super Nintendo (or Super Famicom in Japan) which is considered not only one of the best Mega Man games of all time but also one of the best games on the system. 2 more came out (along with Mega Man 7 and Mega Man Soccer, which is not part of the X series) and then eventually went on to the 32 bit era (Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn, as Capcom didn't care for Nintendo's N64 console) and released X4. The graphics were redone but were still in 2D and along with that were cinemas and voice acting. Of course we can forget about voice acting as it was still very bad. Later, in 2001, X5 came out and the gameplay was the same but a few different things were added. X6 came out a year later and this was the final X game to come out for the PSone (Sega's Saturn had only X4 due to being a failure). People were displeased with X5 and X6 due to \"unupdated\" gameplay and difficulty level. Then This... This game came out. When I first played it I was excited to play a new X game because the X games were actually my favorite games of all time. I played through this disaster and my heart was shattered into a million tiny pieces. First of all, you can't play as X... hold on a second, you can't play as X! I later found out why Capcom did this and it was because it was part of the story as X didn't want to fight anymore so you play as Zero and AXL (Why did they make this character? he sucks!). The gameplay was way too weird for my tastes and the boss battles were just terrible. Go on YouTube and look up the gameplay and boss battles for more info. I only played this game once but playing it just once told me to never ever play this disgrace again.

As the series went on it was nearing its peek. meg man X was insanely good, great powerups, and o so much mroe to collect, as was X2, and especially the ultra rare, 125 dollar X3. The trnslation to the next gen consoles is usually the ultimate down fall of great side scrolling, old school shooter, and this is no exception. Megaman had some undoubtedly rough spots, what with megaman legends, and megaman 64, things were really looking down. Then capcom graced us with megaman X4, good ol' side scrolling fun, and megaman was good again for a brief shining moment. Then again the quality began to slip with X5 and 6, and X7 is definately the low point.\nthe problem with this game is that megaman was never meant to be a 3D expierience, it just doesnt work. The game has terrible controls, average graphics, and infuriates you past the point of caring anymore. Megaman should frusterate you, but before it fueled you to do better, now it just pisses you off and causes a lot of broken controllers. The megaman anniversery edition just came out, and is an excellent old school finger numbing smash!

Vegan","reviewText":"Being a huge fan of XSN Golf for Xbox, I decided to try Tiger Woods' game because of all the rave reviews I've heard.  I was so disappointed.  The controls are rather difficult and hard to master.  Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 is not that much different from last year's Tiger. The analog swing is unchanged, letting you control the power and direction of your shot with a back-and-forward motion on the analog stick.\nOne of the big new additions to Tiger Woods 2004 is the \"game face\" feature that allows you to create your own pro golfer with a rather painstaking level of detail. This player creation mode lets you define virtually every aspect of your player's appearance. For some idea as to how extensive it is, there are 18 different attributes that can be modified in terms of facial structure alone, not including facial hair, eye color, skin tone, and what your golfer's teeth might look like. Truly, the level of character customization offered by the game face feature is unparalleled.\nThe only nagging issue with the Tiger Woods games that EA has yet to address seriously is the game's soundtrack. For the past two years, EA has been assembling seemingly random collections of contemporary licensed songs and calling them soundtracks.","summary":"Difficult to control, no real improvements","unixReviewTime":1088985600,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

{"overall":1,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"11 12, 2012","reviewerID":"A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR","asin":"B00009WAUO","reviewerName":"Mike London","reviewText":"I've already reviewed \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" elsewhere, with both the 8-Bit NES version and the \"Super Mario All-Stars\" version.  I don't want to spend a lot of time and space on \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" specifically, but instead focus on this port (which is based on the \"Super Mario Allstars\" version).  We all know \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" is a classic title.  So, let's dispense with the cursory introduction of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\".  Basically, this is just a copy and paste job from a short blurb I wrote in my 2004 review of \"Super Mario All-stars\".\n\n\"SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3: The best selling game ever released independently, SMB3 greatly expanded the Mario universe with the introduction of several new enemies, Bowser's children (who was the mother, I wonder? Godzilla's ex?), and introduced cool new suites for Mario to wear. The game play was more expansive than ever, with cool new secrets to discover and eight tremendously large worlds. This game laid the foundation for so many other plat-formers, especially SUPER MARIO WORLD. While SMB2 felt like a weird detour, SMB3 took Mario back to the atmosphere or the original game, taking it a thousand different directions, and coming up with one of the best games ever developed. Although there were a few tweaks for the ALL STARS release (some levels got a few more coins to make it easy to access game secrets), like the other games this is tremendously faithful to the original NES release. That alone makes this essential playing\"\n\nTo further elaborate, there are a few cosmetic changes, but this is largely the All-stars port of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" that we all know and adore.  Ok, we all love SMB3?  It's an eternal classic, etc, etc. Best game on the NES. Yada yada.  Everyone on the same page?  Good.\n\nNow, let's get to the problems of \"Super Mario Advance 4\", and yes, there are problems.  Well, one problem anyway.  And it's a BIG problem.  It's a little selling point called e-Reader compatibility.  What's so great about e-Reader cards you ask?  Well, I'm glad you asked.\n\ne-Reader cards features new content than can be added to pre-existing games.  In the case of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", there were three specific types: Power-ups (which uploads specific items into Mario or Luigi's inventory list and can be used an unlimited amount of times), Demo Cards (which showed Mario speed-running, collecting enough coins to unlock a blue Toad House, or doing infinite 1-Up tricks - essentially, the hint videos of \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" six years before), and, wait for it . . . New Levels.\n\nYes, you read right.  New levels.  Yes, Nintendo made NEW LEVELS to \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", and a whole new world called, appropriately enough, \"World-e\".  Note, these are not the 15 inaccesible levels embedded in the original NES \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" code. Nintendo released ten levels in Japan, the PAL reigion, and America, with two different series.  Fantastic, eh?  Awesome?\n\nNo, not really.  In fact, as a Mario can you just feel cheated.  Why?  Well, for one, although Japan frequently gets exclusive content, Nintendo released a full TWENTY TWO additional new levels in Japan only, because (again, wait for it) . . . Nintendo discontinued the e-Card reader\n\nSo, what's frustrating here?  Mainly, Nintendo made THIRTY THREE NEW LEVELS (which, to put in perspective, is over a third of the original game, as \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" has 88 levels total), plus five re-made levels in \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" style of \"Super Mario Bros.\".  These were levels 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and 2-1.  Also, in homage to \"Super Mario World\" there are five new coloured switches which effect gameplay in different ways, but again only were released in Japan.\n\nAlthough many think Boomerang Mario first appeared in \"Super Mario 3D Land\", actually he first appeared in these one-off levels on the e-Cards, but (with only one exception, \"Slidin' the Slopes\", where you can use a boomerang on that one level only, just like Goomba's Shoe on 5-3) no one outside of Japan got to play as Boomerang Mario.  2\/3s of the e-cards appeared only in Japan.\n\nAnother problem with the e-Cards?  In World-e, there are three mushroom houses, each featuring three specific mini-games.  To unlock these mushroom houses, you must get Advance Coins found in the new levels (a precursor to the Star Coins of the \"New Super Mario Bros.\" series).  But here's the kicker.  Outside of Japan, there's only enough coins to access ONE of these three mini-games, because there's not enough currency in the ten levels that Nintendo actually did release to unlock the other two.\n\nIn Europe, the gamers got screwed even worst than the Americans, with the e-Card functionality completely disabled, inaccessible through normal gameplay.\n\nFor Mario fans, this is beyond disappointing.  Nintendo put so much effort into new content, and yet do to poor implementation the majority of gamers will not get to experience these fantastic levels.  The e-reader was also a failure, so the cards weren't available for very long anyway.  Had all this new content been released in the game proper, \"Super Mario Advance 4\" would be the definitive port of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\"; as it stands, there is only a vague sense of disappointment and incompletion for those who know about the new content.\n\nThese are the true Lost Levels in the Mario universe, still commercially unreleased and widely difficult to play legitimately.  Note that the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" had 32 levels.  These lost levels are 32 in number, along with three bonus levels and five remade levels.\n\nIn the NES days that would be a full-length Mario title!  Why oh why Nintendo????\n.\n.\n-----\nReleased Levels Outside of Japan:\n\n1.  Wild Ride in the Sky (Included with the game) (Japanese: Sky Athletics!)\n2.

It almost seems that the designers intentionally removed all of the good stuff from the first game.\nFirst, there is the way the game looks. I am not talking here about performance issues. I have a new computer with a 9800xt graphics card and 1 GB ram, and the game runs smoothly on my machine. The problem is that it just does not look very good. When you consider some of the amazing graphics that have been done in computer games in the last couple of years (Splinter Cell, for example, or even in budget titles like Devastation) it is hard for me to understand why this game looks so bad. Maybe part of it is the the artwork and design; the character animations look like weird cartoon figures. Also, the game areas are too small. Forget about the big, sprawling environments in DX. Here you will be constantly waiting for the next little area to load.\nForget about the much-hyped physics; dead bodies flop around in a ridiculous way, and bumping into objects sends them spinning through space like Babe Ruth hitting one out of the park.\nThe skill system, which made DX (and its predecessor System Shock) so awesome are gone. Why? The ability to customize your character and evolve through the course of the game was one of the most satisfying parts. You've probably already heard about the Universal Ammo thing, another serious design mistake IMO. The game is also quite short, and seems much shorter than the original. Also, without the various skill paths through the game, there is little replayability.\nBasically this is a textbook case of how to ruin a game sequel.","summary":"Textbook case of how to ruin a sequel","unixReviewTime":1073088000,"vote":"13","style":null,"image":null}

The \"plot\" is virtually non-existant. The game is basically a series of battles. There are no puzzles, nothing in particular to unlock except new battles, and very little sense of progress. There's virtually nil NPC interaction and nothing to figure out. If I wanted a game that was nothing but combat, I wouldn't be playing FF, i'd break out my old copy of the PC dos-based Dungeon Hack (which is exactly what it sounds like).\n\nThe laws are arbitrary. Restrictions on what kind of combat you're allowed to engage in SHOULD make a game interesting (they at least keep you from overspecializing in, say, warriors or wizards). But when the game arbitrarily and randomly decides \"you can't use weapons in this battle\" or \"you can't use magic in this battle\" with no real rationale, you just start to get annoyed with it. A MUCH better way of preventing over specialization is to throw the player up against a wider variety of monsters so that they MUST have multiple classes to be able to play to all the enemy's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nI also really dislike the idea of gaining skills by equiping certain items (instead of, oh, you know, USING the skills in question?). The result is that you end up equipping really weak and generally useless items for longer than you conceivably would in any other game, or you end up lacking very basic skills. Both are artificially limiting.\n\nOverall, I think the game just lacks a lot of what makes the Final Fantasy franchise such a popular one, and that's a shame, especially consider how good the original Tactics is supposed to be. This is the first time I've ever NOT finished an FF game that I bought. Not because it was difficult, but because it was mind-numbing.","summary":"A big disappointment","unixReviewTime":1227484800,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

I thought from the start it wouldn't be great but I didn't expect it to be so bland and vapid.  The story opens on a school-yard snowball fight between the munchkins of a small public school, and a clever tutorial instructs you how to play the game throughout the snow fight.  Then three of the loser kids (including the protagonist) go to a house read a book, then wish they weren't losers and were in that fantasy world.  Then while they sleep the world changes and then the main guy ask the other two to help him get the world back to normal but they don't want to because they're not losers there... then you go on a million missions, and the story dies with your motivation to play.\nGameplay 5\/10:  The battle system is pretty much the same as the first, except you have to learn skills and magic by equipting weapons that have that skill on them.  This wouldn't bother me except that you often have to equip very weak weapons to learn skills you may have missed or haven't gotten to yet.  The battles feel slower then its big brother and they just aren't as fun.\nGraphics 5\/10:  I guess they're good for a GBA game but the first has much better visuals.

Where to start...Of why I am glad I wasted my parent's money on this game instead of my own.\n\nNegatives...\n\n1. The relationships made in this game are difficult and even  harder to maintain. How come you have to interact with everyone and they do not even notice you are alive? They never intiate any conversation with you when you are at a community lot or at your house. The men in the game have a unisex personality and do not differ from the women in the house. What's the difference between making the men, men and the women, women? Their interests are the same, their conversational options are the same, \"Joke\" and \"Chat\". Starting the relationships is VERY slow, you can talk and get close to people and 2 days later they aren't your friend anymore. Snore! There is no general idea of beauty in the game, the looks don't matter, so it doesn't matter what you look like and if this is a simulation game what's real about that? Marxism in its truest form.\n\n2. The language was cute at first but it got annoying when you had to analyze the thought bubbles to figure out how the talk was going. I made a teenager and she was the stereotypical look of beauty and she was treated no different. If you are buying this game because you want to be defiant and deviant, then you have the wrong game. The sex in the game is so far and in between, the most I got out of these lame characters was one lame kiss. You are not treated any different if you have money or not.\n\n3. The game is made for girls, its got the frivilous collecting and decorating.\n\n4. The neighborhood is small and on your block where your house is, if you step out of your house and look down the road its blankness of emptiness. The sims AI is weak most times when they have a problem or need like a bathroom emergency, they are standing right next to the toliet and they don't react until you direct them. They need too much food to live, too much sleep to live and too much social to live. If you are looking for a free environment in this game, how bout all the people that want this idea take it, harness it and put it into the living world!\n\n5. The jobs & the school the sims go to are invisible. So they just disappear. The books they read are only 3 subjects to earn a skill, Mechanical, cooking and cleaning.\n\n6. The DNA code is not really that, its a standard code dictated by the Aspiration of your parents. That is not DNA its just a computer generated code that makes for the same signs are the parents.\n\n7. The balanced aspiration characters are boring as people, the other unstable ones act like addicts. They stay up until the dead of night when they know that they have school or work the next day. So they stay up and obessess over whatever they are lacking in, if it be creative or fun. Then their whole cycle is thrown off because they are offset, not enough sleep, comfort, social or fun.\n\n8. Once you get behind in homework there is no catching up.\n\nPositives...\n\n1. You can fence your sims in the backyard and starve them to Death.\n\n2. You can put a dead Sim family member's grave in the fence with your starving sim.\n\n3. Death comes to all terrible Sims. The animation for Death was the best graphics in the game.\n\n4. The graphical detail was high in the game but what you saw got boring.\n\n5. If you abuse your brats in the game the social workers come and pick them up. That is a great feature.\n\nStill better than Animal Crossing, but that game was a turd on a stick.","summary":"Worthless & Lame","unixReviewTime":1103846400,"vote":"8","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is NOT a Final Fantasy game.  It doesn't even come close to the Legend of Zelda in terms of action\/adventure.  It is a waste of time, space, energy, and money.  All together.\n\nI made the regretful mistake of putting this product on my Amazon Wish List when it first came out.  After testing it at stores and reading about it, I quickly realized the game was cheese.  I forgot, however, to remove it from my Wish List.  My brother and sister bought it for me for my birthday one year!  Aye yie yie!\n\nSo because of the $50 they scrounged together in my honor, I figured I'd give the game a thorough shot.\n\nI couldn't take it anymore by the time I got to the second level.  It was atrocious.  I felt sorry for the Final Fantasy name and for my relatives for dropping the cash.\n\nEnough of the emotional banter.  Let me try to give an analytical review of this game.\n\nFirst of all, it does not meet the definition of a classic role-playing game.  (Within the last couple of years, however, I have noticed \"RPG\" taking on a new meaning.  Now it means simply playing as someone else.  Grand Theft Auto, for example, is now classified as an RPG.)  But with today's loose definition of \"RPG,\" you can call it that, I guess.  But I grew up with real RPGs, like Dragon Warrior, the Final Fantasy titles, Lufia, Breath of Fire, etc.  (These were all turn-based RPGs.)\n\nSecond, FF:CC does not develop your characters sanely.  Sorry, but whoever programmed this atrocity embarrassed the genre of action\/adventure.\n\nThird, I recommend you boycott any GameCube title that requires the use of the Game Boy Advance to play multiplayer.  It is asinine to expect people\/kids to pay money for such an inconvenient, expensive, and improper method to simply play with your friends.\n\nLastly, this game is best suited for gamers who do not like real RPGs but prefer an action game with unique challenges in gameplay.  Yes, FF:CC is an action\/adventure, but unlike most others, the gamer will simply have to learn this somewhat different style (it is more hack & slash than anything - the multiplayer functionality should have saved this game from a bad review, but it was disappointing at best).  But other than that, the game will offer essentially ZERO to true RPG gamers, especially those who love the Final Fantasy series.  Stay away from this game if you love Final Fantasy titles.","summary":"Worst...game...ever.","unixReviewTime":1156896000,"vote":"14","style":null,"image":null}

Unfortunately, the side effect of this weapon strike is that hell's minions now have an easy exit to the earth's surface. In addition to that is an escaped experimental supersoldier, developed by Spawn's primary earthly adversary, Jason Wynn.\nNow that you know what the game is about, you can know how bad it is.\nFirst off, you have an extremely lackluster fighting system.  Press punch once and you'll swing Spawn's axe.  Press it twice, and it does a different one swing attack.  Press it three times and you get 1 combo.  So basically it goes (1) uppercut slash, (2) a forward flip attack, and (3) a jumping axe slam attack. How exciting is that?  There's also a one swoop jump attack, but you will only need this in special cases and even then it becomes repetative.\nSecond, the guns are pretty useless, when it comes down to it.  I'm curious why no one in the production team thought to ask why have guns, if you can't find enough ammo to use them adequately?\nIf the game has any saving grace, I would have to say it lies in both your chain attacks and the special moves as they are fairly interesting.  The chain attacks are by far the best thing this game has going for it.  You can either use them to simply pummel your foes back to the underworld or you can send them there in pieces, literally splitting them to the four winds!\nThe special moves are called \"Hell Attacks\" and there is a meter to regulate how much you can abuse it, because let's face it, you will.  Most of them are various projectile attacks, but the most useful ones would be the time-dilation effect and the furies from hell.\nThe time-dialtion basically gives you the ability to move faster than everyone else, or slow everyone down, depending on how you look at it.\nAs for the furies, Spawn has the ability to summon a group of spirits from hell to attack an intented victim.  A very satisfying move indeed.\nThe absolute worst part of this game are the jump puzzles.  Who puts jump puzzles in a superhero game?  It defies all reason.  You will need to use your cape and chain power to pull off these ridiculous yet necessary excersizes.\nDon't expect good music either.  This game has the most dreariest hum tones I've ever heard.  There's simply no life to it.\nFinally, if you want a repetative poor excuse for a superhero game, or are just a die-hard Spawn fan, then this is the game for you.","summary":"This game is trash!","unixReviewTime":1087084800,"vote":"7","style":null,"image":null}

DBZ: Taiketsu, sadly, joins their dismal ranks. If nothing else, Taiketsu succeeds somewhat in capturing the simple visual charm of the show. The large characters look clear and visible on the tiny GBA screen, but overall they can't compete with the superior graphics of GBA champions MK:DA and Street Fighter, and Taiketsu's herky-jerky animation is also particularly distracting. To save battery juice, go ahead and mute the muffled background music and scratchy sound effects-since the game lacks character voices, you won't miss anything important. Taiketsu's button-mashing gameplay is shallow and simplistic, even for a kid's fighting title. There are 15 characters total, including favorites from both the series (like Cell and Goku) and the movies (including the popular Brolly). Aside from the occasional super-move, each character boasts only a meager handful of attacks and combos. Worse, there's very little difference between the various fighters. Players can also occasionally take to the skies during combat, but that gimmick burns out quickly. On the plus side, the game thoughtfully includes several play modes (like Tournament and Endurance) to help extend the replay value; unfortunately, none of the game types are interesting or particularly enjoyable. Another nice touch is the Soul Calibur-esque secret system, which allows players to earn Z Points to unlock bonus modes, settings, and pictures.

I just couldn't see myself ever inserting the disc again after the first few days.  The gameplay is silly, the story is silly, the voice acting is ... well, it's actually decent.  But I don't buy games for the voice acting alone.\n\nThe \"innovative\" lift-and-throw feature is interesting the first couple of times, but once you learn how to exploit it all the time, it becomes more of a chore, like something you're being forced to do instead of something fun.  Same with the ludicrous geo-color-nonsense.  Yes, you CAN kill everything on the screen with it, but how is that engaging or immersive?  To me, it just makes everything ridiculously simple, and it gets old fast.\n\nAnd the bit about leveling up items?  Ugh.  Seriously, I cannot be bothered.

The elevator battle towards the end of the game is the most poorly designed aspect in recent memory.  After more than 20 tries, I just couldn't beat it.  Whenever that happens, you know that a game is fatally flawed.\n\nLet's break it down, shall we?  You encounter this elevator battle about 80% into the game, and you're stuck in it with Farah trying to slay hordes of monsters.  You not only have to stay alive yourself, but you also have to make sure that Farah doesn't die (an impossible feat).  If you don't die, she does; and if she doesn't die, you eventually do.  It's a lose-lose situation, especially within the confines of such small a space.\n\nThere are fountains on either side of the raised area within the elevator, but do you think you can use them to restore your life during the battle?  NO!  That's flaw number one.  Number two:  the camera angles are AWFUL.  Every single time at some point(s) in the battle, the camera would move behind a curtain, thereby obstructing your view and leaving you open to needless attack.  Three:  this game has HORRIBLE jumping mechanics.  Where you want the prince to jump, he jumps the other way.  Performing precise wall-run attacks during this battle is near impossible to execute on point each time.  Then, vaulting over enemies doesn't work all the time either.

Basic Geometry, how Michael Bolton became successful.....and how a great and iconic character like Batman can never have a decent video game. The first Batgame for Playstation 2, Vengence, had it's moments. Though it wasn't \"great\" it at least felt like a Batman game. Batman Dark Tomorrow was an outright disaster. And now it looks like Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu continues the downward slide for the Dark Knight.\nRise of Sin Tzu's biggest downfall is it's gameplay. Where as Vengence attempted to be more of an adventure oriented game, Rise of Sin Tzu takes an entirely different approach. It's pretty much a straight forward beat 'em up game. But unfortunatley it doesn't know how to keep you interested in it to make you keep wanting to play. The game descends into punching and kicking your way past various non-descript bad guys and the occassional gas bomb lobbed in to the fray by the villain the Scarecrow. Two players can play in a co-operative mode simultaneously but it does little to change the gameplay. The game is interesting for about ten minutes then boredom quickley sets in. After the first few levels I could see that there was pretty much nothing else this game had to offer.\nThe graphics on this game are decent. Batman, Robin, Batgirl and Nightwing all move with convincing ease and fluidity. But the environments are rather plain and sterile. They look like they could be just about any street anywhere. There was nothing to indicate that this was Gotham City. It could have been Cleveland for I knew. The sound was also very generic. Sure Batman and company uttered some pretty good \"one liners\", but it got old fast.\nThe controls are very easy to manage. They are however wasted on a game like this. The time it will take you to become accustomed to the controls is maybe about five to ten minutes.\nThis game managed to let me down on just about every level. I'm not even sure if a hardcore Batfan would even enjoy it. Ubi Soft has shamelessly squandered the potential for this licence. At this point the only thing that I think would inject new life into the franchise is if the game license changed hands and went to a company like Activision, Electronic Arts, Eidos or anyone else. If you can track down a copy of Batman: Vengence, you would be better served playing that. Though not perfect it's the better of the two Batman games.","summary":"Terrible!!

UBI Soft as a \"feature\" on their PC software that prevents installation from any drive with write capacity.  Why they feel that will slow down a game cracker, and why they don't mind blowing off an entire segment of the market, is entirely beyond me, but that's not the point here.  Call UBI Soft tech support BEFORE buying this or any other PC game from them, and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install.  Software (such as Chessmaster 9000, to grab a random UBI product as an example) doesn't come with a warning on the box (in \"some\" cases, they claim -- I haven't found a single box that does), nor is there a warning on the Amazon product pages (short of reviews like this).  One could speculate that they're perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some won't be able to install it, but I'll leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imagination.\nUBI Soft's tech support has said that this \"feature\" extends to *all* of their PC titles.  So fair warning, particularly to folks with laptops where DVD\/CDRW drives came standard, ask before you buy.  Perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy, UBI will smarten up.  \"Flawed\" because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isn't going to slow a determined game cracker\/pirate down, it's only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game.  Worse, they don't find out until they've opened the package and tried to install, which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the seller.\nI'm certain this game deserves more than 1 star, and suspect it will see some good reviews from people who are able to install, but I can't give it more than a single.  That's a commentary on UBI Soft and their \"feature\", not about the game itself.","summary":"WARNING to all CDRW drive owners","unixReviewTime":1079049600,"vote":"236","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

I installed this game without any difficulties and the game would not launch. So I uninstalled the game, disabled my anti-virus, and reinstalled the game. Still would not launch. So $20 completely wasted because I cannot even start the game. I wrote technical support for the Adventure Company - we'll see if they even bother to respond. They didn't the last time I wrote them about a completely different problem with another one of their games.\nI ended up having to get a new video card in order to play this game. Although, I'm sure it will come in handy for future games it was a complete waste of money regarding this game.\nI hated this game and I admit that I could not even finish it. The graphics were absolutely terrible, bad enough that it made gaming more difficult since I often couldn't make out what I was looking at. I attempted to play this game right after playing Syberia II. I don't expect every game to look as beautiful and detailed as the Syberias but this game looks like something that could have been produced 10 years ago.\nThe other thing that drove me crazy was the music. For some reason the game had a jazz-like soundtrack. That would be fine if the game took place in New Orleans or Chicago instead of some planet elsewhere in the galaxy.\nI do my best to finish games (after all who wants to waste the money) no matter how bad they are.

Like the saying goes, 'there's no such thing as bad chocolate'.  But, at this point, I'm not holding my breath for some Godiva-like quality with this one.\"\nWell, the game did finally arrive and after playing it for a couple of hours last night, I can honestly say that this game is actually like the product \"Mocklate\" in the 'Friends' episode where Monica is hired to cheerfully promote the faux-product.  It looks just like chocolate, but it leaves a really BAD taste in your mouth!\nMy wife and I really love to play adventure games, it is the only game genre we play.  If you've seen some of our other game reviews, you will know this is true.  While the initial episode of Crystal Key was inexplicably a strong seller, the game itself was not exactly earth-shattering.  We've played a lot of adventure games and 'The Crystal Key' ranks well down on our list of favorites (but, by all means, not at the bottom).  It was just a good, solid, average adventure game.  When they announced a sequel, we figured that they probably learned from the competition, grown along with the technology of gaming, and created a new chapter of the story that matches or exceeds the original.\nBoy, could that NOT be further from the truth.  This game is truly awful!  With the delays and price-chopping factored in, we had set our expectations exceedingly low.  But, some how, they managed to sink even well below that level.  The pre-released screen shots and trailer for the game cannot prepare you for how bad the actual gameplay really is.  Here are just a few of the CONs to the game (there are no PROs):\n-The graphics are even worse than the original game (which is almost five years old now).  Like the first game, they are pre-rendered, 360 degree panning shots that you are forced to navigate from point to point.  However, the textures and details of these graphics are far worse than in game one.  Every scene looks washed out and out of focus.  Plus, the cylindrical views actually \"jumped and popped\" as we turned which got exceedingly annoying after a while.\n-The music soundtrack, I am not kidding, sounds like it was dubbed from a porno movie!  I think they meant to give the game a \"hipper\" beat but, oh my, I don't think they intended to make THAT association.\n-The characters of the game are immovable, pixilated add-ins that show absolutely no emotion.  The voice-over acting is adequate, but the dialog is sophomoric at best.\nThis drivel looks like it was created by a twelve-year-old, indy game developer using an old 386 computer.  Unfortunately, the list of credits for this game includes many members of a professional creative team!  I would have been much more lenient with my review had it actually been an independent creation.  ...","summary":"Not worth the wait...","unixReviewTime":1079308800,"vote":"14","style":null,"image":null}
{"overall":1,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"05 3, 2004","reviewerID":"AJ35UKIVBT23T","asin":"B0000A344P","reviewerName":"thomasbc","reviewText":"An old Ross Perot quote pretty much sums up this game: \"You're going to hear a giant sucking noise\" as you play this game.  Whoo, baby, does this game stink!  I thought that 'The Crystal Key II' (another recent Dreamcatcher\/Adventure Company game) was pretty awful, but I did not know there was a whole other level of bad below that!  Holy cow, how does dreck like this manage to get published with such flashy and professional packaging and marketing?\nJeez, where to start?  How about with the incredibly bad interface.  The game is a standard point-and-click adventure game where you navigate from point to point and then pan around in 360 degree views.  Panning requires you to hold down the left mouse button while dragging the mouse in the direction you want to pan.  What is so awful about this interface is that when you have dragged your mouse the entire width of your mousepad, you have only panned about one quarter of way around the view.  You then have to lift and reposition your mouse to drag it some more in the direction you are panning!  Most games have an option to correct this by letting you set the mouse sensitivity to a speed that you (and your video card) are comfortable with.  Is that option available here? NO! Can you pan with your keyboard instead? NO! As a matter of fact there are absolutely NO games options whatsoever!  You are stuck with one panning rate, one music volume, one dialog volume (a real shame since the dialog is putrid), and...you get the picture.\nGetting an item into your inventory is pretty easy (just click on it), but getting it out is absolutely painful.  You first have to click on a screen icon to pull up your inventory list, click on an item to see a larger view of it in the middle of your screen, click on that large image to change your cursor into a representation of that item, and then click on the exit button of the inventory screen.  Finally you then have to click on the game spot where you think the item might be useful.  Unfortunately, you typically have no clue as to what might work at a specific hot spot, so you end up trying EVERYTHING in your inventory to see if something works (and there is a lot of junk in there sometimes)!\nThe puzzles of the game are a joke.  As a matter of fact, the very first two puzzles you encounter are pretty much the same thing: try to find the correct sequence of clicks to get all the way through the puzzle; if you guess wrong, start over!  They don't get much more imaginative beyond that.  My game came with a \"limited edition\" game strategy guide included free.  I'm guessing that all of them will come with this guide because, otherwise, nobody will be able to (nor want to) finish this embarrassment.\nAs a final insult, the developers thought they would try to spice up their incoherent game by adding a lot of humor.  Done well, humor can add a very entertaining aspect to an adventure game.  The classic Zork games are excellent examples.  When done badly, as in this case, it just becomes irritating to the point of distraction.  Most of it is just not funny (okay, maybe to a six year old) and does not \"fit\" in the atmosphere of this game.  Jive talking jungle natives?  Please.\nAgain, like Crystal Key II, this looks like the work of an independent game developer who has spent years putting together a workable game using \"knives and bearskins\".  If so, I would have admired the work and enjoyed the game for what it was.  Unfortunately, this game was, again, developed by what looks to be a large team (Hexagon).  Games like these give the game genre, which I love the most, a huge black eye and are probably the reason why so many people get turned off by adventure games.  What a shame, because there are some really good ones out there.  Unfortunately, you have to dig through a lot of dung like this to find it.  Avoid this game.","summary":"Don't let the packaging fool you!","unixReviewTime":1083542400,"vote":"83","style":null,"image":null}

Take for example \"The Mystery of the Mummy\", a Sherlock Holmes mystery game that made the world's most famous detective seem insipid.  As lousy as some of their attempts have been in the past, high concepts keep players coming back to The Adventure Company.  \"Jack the Ripper\" has a concept so ideal it seems impossible to ruin, and yet the game is phenomenally atrocious.\n\nThe game is set in New York City in 1901.  A couple of poverty-stricken showgirls have been murdered in a fashion similar to the Jack the Ripper killings of 1888.  Jimmy Palmer, a na've young reporter, is assigned by his editor to write a series of newspaper articles on the killings.  As Jimmy looks into the murders, he discovers that the same serial killer might be responsible for both the 1888 and 1901 murders.  There's the high concept.  The game play is from the first-person perspective of Jimmy from beginning to end.  It consists of returning to the same locations and talking to the same people repeatedly, using dialogue options that aren't really all that optional.  Occasionally, Jimmy can collect items such as keys and money to appease stubborn suspects.  There are only one or two actual puzzles in the entire game.\n\n  The game parades many characters based loosely on actual suspects in the real-life Jack the Ripper murders, but Jimmy never seems to come any closer to solving the mystery.  A game called \"Jack the Ripper\" should at least guarantee a creepy ambience, and the game seems to succeed in that area initially, but it soon becomes apparent that ambience isn't enough.  Menacing footsteps when no one is following you, whispered dialogue that is unintelligible and unimportant to the storyline, and shady characters that can't be interacted with and don't contribute anything to the plot become annoying after a short while.  In one room, a hushed, secretive whisper resembling \"I can sell you the most beautiful radishes\" can be heard repeatedly.  Dark, blood-stained alleys lose their creepiness after a while.  The score is beautiful and unnerving, but it only adds to the misleading feeling that something frightening is going to happen, and it hardly ever does.  There are also several moments in the game where Jimmy appears to have a psychic connection with a raven, leading to trippy graphic sequence with no pay-off.\n\nMany critics have noted the series of Irish folk tunes performed by one of the game's characters as a bright spot.  The songs themselves are beautiful and haunting, like the game's score, but the animated performances that accompany them are less varied and more mechanical than a floorshow at Chuck E. Cheese's.  Also, be warned that there isn't a twist ending, just an anticlimactic one.  Maybe someday still The Adventure Company will redeem itself.  In the meantime, avoid this game.","summary":"The Adventure Company Drops the Ball","unixReviewTime":1149897600,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

The combat is dumbed down from the original Butokai, forcing an unnecessary and tedious RPG element. The difficulty is horribly scaled and no preset difficulty option exists. The game strays as far as it can from the story without straying far enough to make the game a unique and enjoyable experience. I get what they where trying to do with changing the game from a linear story to a board game but the execution was just awful. The original budokai had a better story and tournament mode and also more of a character selection with each character having better and time appropriate move-pools (when you fight Frieza the first time you will have access to the spirit bomb). The more modern Butokai Tenkaichi 3 has the series' best combat and this game just is not worth your money when both it's predecessor and successor are vastly superior.

I loved him and the other Natural Born Thrillers in WCW and it's a shame WWE didn't do more with his devil's advocate character. Also, Ultimo Dragon was in this game, which I remember seeing online that he was coming to WWE. As far as I knew, those two were never in any other WWE games...And the main reason, I bought this game is...................................\n\nThis game is from pretty much the exact time RIGHT before I gave up on watching professional wrestling. I watched from like 96 to 2002...some of 2003 and 2004...and it just wasn't the same at all. I feel sad saying that. Like I'm now discussing a past romantic relationship that ended very horribly with feelings being deeply hurt. But there, I said it! So yeah, I got a burst of nostalgia looking at the roster and thought, for the price a used copy goes for, why not?\n\nWell,let me tell you why not to buy this game.\n\n1) As another reviewer said, I think he was more generous and gave the game 3 stars, this game is SO UNBALANCED. So yeah, I'm Shawn O' Haire and Roddy Pipper is my tag team partner. We have one match, and then win the tag team titles. I am fine playing against the Guerreos. But then the game keeps putting me against Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit...you know those guys who have like 20 points higher than I do on all my stats?!? So yeah, no matter how good I was I couldn't block a LOT of their attacks. Also, their momentum to gain a finisher builds up faster and their finishers do more damage than mine do. So I went to RAW and the game threw me against STEVE AUSTIN, THE ROCK, and GOLDBERG...Same thing happened. Couldn't beat any of these guys, but other opponents, with stats similar to mine, I could have a good match with.\n\nI fought the ROCK in the gym area, and after like 4 to 5 finishers, he wouldn't stay down long enough for me to pin him. Then the Rock gives me 1...REPEAT 1 Rock Bottom and I get pinned. VERY FAIR!!! Did they even test this??? Wrestlemania 2000 had a better career mode! Enuff said.\n\n2)So many animations. There are a lot of times the game will go into a mini movie to show someone pulling off a move. LET ME PLAY THE GAME!!!\n\n3) The referee will never count a pin if someone is in the ring, WRONG PLACE TO BE REALISTIC IN, GAME, but he will ALWAYS Get in the way when you are trying to strike, which then leads to your opponent getting a second to recover and attack you.\n\n4)The TAG MATCHES. The AI opponents outside the ring gain momentum and gain finishers. So you can be schooling your opponent and they make the tag. Then their partner comes in and does a finisher on you and BAM total 360...the match is over and you have lost.\n\n5)The controls feel very loose and are horrible. I can't tell you how many times I meant to climb the turnbuckle, and my character starts running. Then when you start running there is no way to stop running unless you attack your opponent or the air.\n\n6) Damage. When you take extreme damage. Your opponent gets up and holds themselves. Giving your opponent a COMPLETE opportunity to beat you down.\n\n7) Story mode is dumb. MY MAIN GRIPE IS STORY MODE IS GLITCHY. I've seen the same person scheduled the match before mine, and then he's in the next match with me...HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED IN REAL LIFE??? Also, the game showed the Rock talking to me about our match that night, but then Goldberg was in the match.???\n\nYou can move, but a lot of times there is no one to talk to in the outside arenas. I thought when I bought this game I could choose which superstars on the roster I wanted to interact with. In reality, you can watch and react to a bunch of spontaneous little cutscenes...that give you Superstar points which then let you challenge for different belts. But if you aren't a main guy, you will probably get beaten a lot and not get very far...like I did.\n\n8) I think graphics look horrible. I think the Day of REckoning graphics, which was released like a year later, actually looked good. This looks like garabage.\n\n9) Create a player is dumb. Seriously, you can't pick entrance music for your star!!! WWF ATTITUDE DID THIS BETTER AND IT WAS RELEASED HOW LONG AGO??? YOU WOULD THINK YOU COULD TURN OUT A BETTER PRODUCT THAN THE OLD DESIGNERS CAME UP WITH, RIGHT???!!?\n\n10) Superstars songs just trail off. Yeah, WWF ATTITUDE, again how old is that???, let you actually listen to the whole song in create a player. Here I listen to my characters music after he wins and it just stops mid way in the song...LAME!\n\n11) Legends don't even come out to their music.??? WHY???\n\n12) OMG SO MUCH BUTTON MASHING. Seriously, my wrists still hurt. There is just so much button mashing. Button mashing was invented by lazy game developers. Instead of putting in real ways to get out of holds. TAP ANY BUTTON AS HARD AS POSSIBLE. So yeah, eventually you get carpral tunnel syndrome. THANKS GUYS!!!\n\n13) Taunting does nothing!!! Remember in the n64 games where at least your attitude meter went up??? NOT HERE!!! NOTHING!!!\n\nYeah, so I think that's about it. I was just totally let down by this game in nearly every sense, and I seriously feel I got ripped off for the $5 I paid for this used. Everything was just so lame and seemed broken almost. To put it mildy, TNA IMPACT is a better game than this...and way more fun, too. I thought I was going to get a sense of nostalgia from when I used to love wrestling, but this only helped confirm what I already knew, WWE was getting lame and stupid around then. Thanks for help ruin the few good memories from back then with this atrocity of a game, guys!!!\n\nTHE PRO's??? I got to be in a relationship with Sable for a bit without being Brock Lesnar. So that was cool. And since I bought this used, Vince and co. didn't get financial gain from my purchase.

What happened is, I had to take the controller back 3 times to have it replaced because the analog sticks would give out or get stuck in a certain postion. Now, in MVP Baseball, for example, you need the right stick to dive\/slide with. Well, the analog stick stuck to the right in 2 of them I tried, so that ends up leaving you to have automatic fielding because you can't get to the ball when the player is diving for no reason. With Need for Speed, I found that the 1 controller where the left analog stick went out, the cars were just out of control.\n\nThere are many reviews online as I have found that confirm that Logitech never addressed this controllers issues. Even Tech. Support kept telling me I had just bought a bad controller when I called them on each one.\n\nBe aware, once the analog stick goes, whether it is 2 days or 2 months, you can't calibrate it.

You come up with a good concept, which in this case has spawned an impressive game dynasty whose first three games were absolute classics, and then you screw it up.\nThis game, luckily, doesn't try to be a 1st-person shooter; I haven't found a single good 1st-person shooter on the Game Boy Advance and am convinced that the GBA simply doesn't have the response and accuracy of controls necessary for games like Half-Life, Counter-Strike, No One Lives Forever...or Medal of Honor.  It retains the excellent Michael Giacchino score which had distinguished this game series from the pack.  And the World War II locations and weapons remain accurate.  So what's the problem?  The level design, for one thing.  It made precious little sense to me why they would have two fairly player-friendly missions of low difficulty, allowing you to feel out the game, and then launch you into a multi-tier mission where you have to kill about 30 enemies back to back without being able to save.  Difficulty is a necessary part of any game, but this is just ridiculous -- so you survived an onslaught of 40 enemies?  How about we take away any ammo replenishments and send four bombers your way that can attack you behind barriers and kill on contact?  This game also has a hyper-annoying map system where you could take one step into an area and the game \"seals off\" your escape route so that you may find yourself suddenly cornered.  It makes no sense realistically speaking, and it certain does nothing except to frustrate your gameplay.\nThe weapon aiming system is very poor.  Why would they veer your shots to the right?  To be more \"realistic\" because your soldier is right-handed?  This makes diagonal shots very difficult.  Also, your shots don't go straight -- they spray sideways, maybe in an emulation of gun recoil, but that's like saying to the player:  \"You can aim, but not really.\"  Your enemies don't mind -- they have unlimited ammo, and they come in groups.  Having to charge towards your enemy a step just to shift your aim is already annoying, but this \"right-hand bias\" is just dumb.  And the minute an enemy shot hits you, you bounce back and lose control of your character...but you remain vulnerable to attack and so can lose your entire life from just one bullet hit.  Ridiculous.\nSomehow no Electronic Arts game I've played on the GBA has been without fundamental annoyances like these, and it's getting just tiresome.  I *was* going to give this game two stars, but after having played one level 30 times with the same result of being killed by flights of bombers, I simply said \"*&^% this\".  I'll bet the ... game developers had a wonderful time devising ways to kill off the player with hordes of enemies.  Well, this is the last Electronic Arts game I guy, and this game is going straight to a second-hand store.","summary":"Horrible control scheme and a bad map system.","unixReviewTime":1076112000,"vote":"2","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Everything else is just a rotten imitation of that fine game.  The graphics are well drawn, but poorly animated.  The music is lame.  The story is weak, and worst of all, the play controls are horrendous.\nThe ring menu system from \"The Secret of Mana\" was a thing of beauty that let you quickly use items and equip your characters.  \"Sword of Mana\" has ring menus as well, but they're sluggish, and they flash for no apparent reason.  Also, it seems like it takes forever for the guy to swing his sword after you have pressed the button.  If you play it with the GameCube GameBoy Player, you'll even notice a bit of flicker.\nAnother minor irritation is that no matter what kind of creature you kill, it leaves behind something that looks like a bull skeleton.  I could understand that in 1992, but it's 2003!  Surely ROM is cheap enough by now for the cartridge to hold an assortment of remains.\nI doubt that the original Mana team even worked on this thing.  In the opening, it mentions Brown & Browne, which makes me suspect that Square is just a publisher for this game, not a developer.  They pulled the same dirty trick with \"Breath of Fire\" which was an okay game developed by Capcom, but it was not as good as a Square game.\nIf they couldn't be bothered to do it right, they shouldn't have done it at all.","summary":"Feeble Offspring","unixReviewTime":1072742400,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

It's not even Children of Mana.  It's a totally different beast of a game.  I tried on two separate occasions to get into this game, but one single thing turned me off:  time actually passes during the day.\n\nRemember The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask?  Remember how time passed during the day, and people might or might not be where they're supposed to be since they could be away from their house at that time?  Yeah, I HATE that.  And since Sword of Mana revolves around the same time based system, I HATE this game too.\n\nSo in reality, I can't give you a true game review.  I can only tell you that I couldn't even play it due to being utterly frustrated at having to walk back and forth through areas to wait for the time of day to change to get something done.

This is a brand new computer, with more than plenty of hard drive space & RAM to spare, with a 64mb graphics card.  Unfortunately, there are only TWO graphics cards that this game will recognize.  You can have the most powerful card in the world, and if it isn't NVIDIA or ATI Radeon, you are out of luck.\nDo we want to blow $100-$150 installing a new graphics card, all for the sake of one lousy game, especially one that has gotten the mixed reviews that this game has?  I really don't think so.  We have never had any problems with any other programs we have installed on this system.  The idea that I need to drag a brand new computer back in for an upgrade just strikes me as ridiculous.  This game's designers need to be more flexible when configuring the system requirements.\nOur son never got to play this game, but I know that he would have been driven crazy by the lack of a quick-save feature.  Once again, the game's designers display a profound lack of flexibility.  They must live in some fantasy world where people have all day to kill, slogging through an entire level before being able to save the game.  Get real folks.\nWe have a couple of other EA games, and I have generally been lukewarm about what are obviously console games that have been reconfigured for a PC in a sometimes slap-dash manner.

Let me kep it simple.\nPC GAMER magazine gave this game a rating of 58% out of 100%. That is bad!!!\nLet me quote some lines from their review in the January 2004 issue.\n\" Frustrating camera controls, not enough diversity in character play styles, disappointing failure, stupidly difficult\"\nNeed anyone say anything more? Don't listen to the reviews that gave this high marks. They are LOTR extremists - the same guys that go to Star Trek conventions all dressed up like Kirk or Picard!!!\nFirst of all, most of the guys that gave this game 5 stars wrote reviews before the game was even released!!!! Second, most of them admit they have not even played the game!!! They just love LOTR. Ok..so do I, but don't go suckering some people into blowing their hard earned dollars...\nAre the graphics good in this game...YES. They are truly outstanding and unbelievable!! That is all the nice things I have to say about this game.\nThe game play is terrible. You have to fight in 360 degrees which means that the enemies are between you and your guy. You cannot even see what your doing!!! Oh by the way, you cannot quick save. You can only save at the end of the level! Generally this is fine by me, but since this game is so hard and camera angles constantly make your life miserable....you absolutely need to be able to Quick Save!!!!\nTHE ABSOLUTE WORST THING OF ALL - THE CUT-SCENES!!!!!!\nELECTRONIC ARTS force you to watch all the cut-scenes. NO SKIPPING THEM!!!! And some of them are over 5 minutes long!\nHere is how the game starts - You have to go through all the production credits from EA Games, among others...get through the horrible THX ear blowing intro and about 3 other stupid intros...then the first cut scene happens - this one alone is about 5 minutes of scenes from the last movie. Then you get dumped into the game in the ehat of battle. Talk about confusing as all heck!\nGuess what...if you screw up the game or just want to start over...you have to sit through the credits and all of the games cut scenes all over again!!!!!! NO CHOICE!!!!!!!!\nThanks a lot EA GAMES!!! You milked the MOH franchise to death and ruined what could have been great and now you are just out to milk money from the LOTR saga.\nI played this game through all the way. I normally would want to play a game all over again. Not this time!!!!!!!\nBorrow a copy from a friend or at the very least, download them demo and try it out before you buy!!!!!!!!!!\nHey if you don't believe me...read the comments in some of the LOTR game forums out there! MANY, MANY other people that own this game will agree with me 100%!!!\nSend EAGAMES  a message, send them some e-mail and tell them to allow skipping past cut scenes, send them a message and skip this game.\nTrust me, your money is better spent else where...\nGet Halo, GTA:Vice City, Medal of Honor, or BloodRayne which is a blast and sells for less.","summary":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!","unixReviewTime":1070236800,"vote":"20","style":null,"image":null}

I don't own an Xbox (original) anymore, so I got it for the PC. It looks though to me a terrible port from the console version. The graphics can be up'ed a bit more and it does look nice compared to the consoles, but the car itself controls like crap. It just doesn't feel responsive and it seems to want to turn right on its own sometimes and sometimes when you turn it just wants to keep turning even though you let off the controls. This just makes the game unplayable, especially for a racing game where accuracy of your turns are everything. This is a problem with both the Xbox 360 controller I'm using and the keyboard. Just to make sure it wasn't just my equipment I found this game on a Gamecube emulator and tried it there, it worked perfectly.

I love the old Sim City games, especially 3000. They obviously put a lot of effort into the graphics on this one and they are very good, but the game is a train wreck. They should have stuck to the old engine, but beefed up the amount of things you can do. They should have just added more and more detail, more buildings, more control over city functions, control over climate (global location) when building terrains, more detail in running a city, and then some better graphics. Being able to build cities in arctic surroundings or deserts would be neat. But no, they have to make it so convoluted that just getting started makes you want to scream. Some of the things they added are OK ideas, but it's such a bad game that none of that matters. I found building starting terrains to be an extremely long process in this one. I could have definitely done without the driving around saving the day and using helicopters to fight crime. That whole aspect really seems to belong in some other game. I know that some people may like it, but I think they should have focused on what has made the series what it is. It's only my opinion, but this game gives me a headache just thinking about it and compared to it's predecessors it's a joke. It's like they tried to jazz it up way too much. Isn't part of the reason these games have sold in the past been because people like to just build away? It doesn't need to be slowly morphed into grand theft auto in order to improve it. Definitely the worst of the series that I've ever played.

However, it ends up as a disappointment to anyone who has ever played superior first-person shooter games like Timesplitters 2 or any of the James Bond games.\n*The graphics of this game are the worst I have seen on the Gamecube. Gameplay graphics are \"ok\", but the cut-scene graphics are absolutely terrible. Why even bother with the cut-scenes? The storyline is ridiculous, but that wouldn't bother me if the game offered more in the gameplay department.\n*Controls can be very frustrating, falling from what seems like very short distances can take away more life than you expect. But even with these frustrating controls, the game turns out to be very, very easy. You could beat it in a day if you want.\n*However, there are some cool things. Talking to individuals you come across can be very entertaining and helpful. Some of the objectives you pick up on your missions are actually pretty fun. The \"auto-aim\" is not as annoying as it can be in other first-person shooter games.\n*In short, I'd advise you to rent this game first. It is certainly not the best, or most entertaining, shooter on the market. The language in the game is very strong, as if they added many excuses to drop the \"f-bomb\" just because they could. If you're a die-hard fan of the \"Die Hard\" series, then you might want to check it out. If not, you probably shouldn't bother.","summary":"Disappointing; Rent first!","unixReviewTime":1044489600,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

The graphics are stunning -- unlike anything I've ever seen before.  The music is great, especially the opening sequence which would have worked magnificently on the silver screen.  (I won't go into story details; you can get that easily enough.)\n\nBut, fellow TRON-fans, this game just isn't worth it.  The gameplay is fun only to a degree.  It's addictive, certainly, but only in so much as you keep on wanting to see that pay-off cut scene (which sometimes come and most of the time do not) or that grandiose image or situation that has a big connection to the 1982-hit film -- which, let's face it, is the whole reason why we're playing this game in the first place.\n\nAlso, there is no payoff at the end.  I watched the ending animation clip and thought, \"That's it?  That's all you're going to give me for all this trouble?\"  For, make no mistake about it, this game is a lot of trouble.  I played it on \"Easy\" (there are also \"Medium,\" \"Difficult,\" and \"Insane\" levels) and it was tough.  After awhile, I felt like I was just being challenged for no reason and my character was wandering around.  It was like reading an 800-page book that could have been condensed to 300 pages.\n\nI think most people who bought or will buy this game are doing so mainly because of the unique opportunity to explore the TRON universe.  The gameplay is just an added bonus.  Unfortunately with this game, the universe you're exploring occasionally looks like the film you saw as a kid, but overall it's been revved up with extra icing and eye-candy and less actual substance.\n\nI think the game could have been a lot better if it had looked much more like the movie.  Or perhaps if there had been gameplay scenarios like the movie.  Yes, there are a few.  For instance your primary weapon is the memory disc (that frisbee-looking thing) and there are light-cycles galore.  (These things earn this game two stars from me instead of one).  Perhaps we just weren't ready to jump immediately into the 21st century.  Maybe they could have divided the storyline into segments: one key chapter of the game taking place in the 80s (perhaps right after the film takes place), one in the 90s, and a climactic finale present day.\n\nThose are my two cents' worth.  And I hope for the sake of a possible sequel that they echo many of the desires of other fans as well.","summary":"I'd hate to say it: But it doesn't really deliver","unixReviewTime":1214870400,"vote":null,"style":{"Platform:":" PC"},"image":null}

Two buttons are used for attacking and your monster has the ability to grab various objects and use them either to throw or club an opponent, which is at first interesting, but soon becomes boring. I was hoping that the game would somehow incorporate the TMB's scrolling of various weapons (do I want to blast the enemy with zoomy or use environmental to zap him with a blimp?) but I found the attacks and fighting aspect of the game to be boring and routine. Even the monsters super attacks are uncreative and bland (where is the creative attacks like SweetTooth's Special Attack?)The environments are cool, but not as large, interesting, or moody as TMB.

Jongeling","reviewText":"Resident Evil 2 is easily one of the most fun and enjoyable games that has come out in the past decade. It scares you enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, but the difficulty level is set exactly right so it doesn't get you frustrated. Not to mention that both of the playable characters have two missions, and once you complete those, there are several different gameplay modes rewarded to the player for completing the missions. This enhances the game's replay value quite dramatically.\n\nSo assuming that you have played this game on the original Playstation, I bet you're wondering what is different about the port offered on the Gamecube?\n\nWell, disappointingly enough, not much. The RE2 port is just that - a port. Naturally, however, the Gamecube is a much more advanced system capable of handling much faster polygonal rates, shading, texture, and load times. The overall look is a bit smoother, but not enough to make you say \"wow!\". More like \"hmmm...interesting\". The blood is not so polygonal, and the characters are a bit smoother. If there really is any difference in the load time, it is minimal. The controls are about as good as the original - pending that you can get used to the game on a Gamecube controller. The CMVs are not changed at all. Nothing smoother, nothing overdubbed, nothing brighter or duller, not faster or slower. This can either be a curse or a blessing for you, depending on how devoted you are to the original CMV's, as the CMVs are identical to the Playstation's in every way.\n\nSo while I can't really justify owning a copy of Resident Evil 2 for the Gamecube, I would recommend it to anybody who has never played the game or does not have access to the PS version of it. Resident Evil 2 is a great game, and it continues to hold its value even to this day. If Capcom would have just done the same thing for RE2 and RE3 that they did for the original, I think we would have probably the best series in history on our hands. However, CAPCOM got lazy and decided to port the rest of the titles. Too bad, so sad.\n\nSo to sum it up, if you currently own Resident Evil 2 for the Playstation, save your money because the Gamecube version is really not all that much better.\n\nOriginal game rating and contents = 9\/10\n\n\"lazy\" Gamecube port rating = 2\/10\n\nfinal score on the re-release for the Gamecube = 4\/10","summary":"Resident Evil 2 for the Gamecube","unixReviewTime":1139356800,"vote":"3","style":{"Platform:":" GameCube"},"image":null}

I was really looking forward to it, having for many years owned Chessmaster II for the Playstation One. I was dismayed to discover that in many ways the Playstation 2 version is a step backwards. The graphics and interface of the Playstation One version are far more user friendly, with many more options for customization.\n\nThe most irritating thing about Chessmaster for Playstation 2 is the size of the chess board, which is tiny. This means you have to strain your eyes to make out the pieces, which all look alike - unless of course you like sitting 10cm in front of the screen, which rather defeats the object of using a game console rather than a PC. It is as though the designers thought of everything except the one thing that really matters: the comfort of the viewer. I find myself using the 2D display, ignoring all the 3D options, simply because it is easier to make out the pieces, but even on the 2D display they are uncomfortably small.\n\nWhat's so frustrating is how much space is pointlessly wasted, which means that the chess board could easily have been twice as big if only the designers had given the matter of viewer comfort some thought. For example, the designers included displays of the pieces that have been captured. Now how pointless is that! As if it isn't obvious which pieces have been captured simply by looking at the board.\n\nThe overall interface isn't much to shout about either. For example, you might have thought that taking back a move would be possible at the touch of a button. But no, you have to bring up a separate menu, scroll down it and only then can you take back your move. There is no way to reset a game to the start, so analyzing finished games can only be done by taking back each move (which means bringing a new menu up each time, remember). If it was a rated game, the computer won't let you take back moves even when the game is finished.\n\nCertain preferences, such as your preferred time controls, do not appear to save, which means that you have to reset them each time you load the game. Don't even get me started on the controls for playing through master games or browsing the list of opponents, which are so confusing and unintuitive it is almost a joke.\n\nOf course, at the end of the day chess is chess, and once you get used to the irritatingly small board and clunky interface then this game is obviously enjoyable if you enjoy chess. But it is so frustrating that this game could have been so much better, if only a small amount of thought had been given to addressing the issues above.","summary":"Dissappointed","unixReviewTime":1149292800,"vote":"5","style":null,"image":null}

Mok","reviewText":"The concept had seemed interesting ever since the first Dynasty Warriors game hit the shelves, but it wasn't until now that I tried actually playing this game.\nAs with all other one-against-many fighting games -- like Final Fight or the granddaddy of them all, Double Dragon -- the computer basically keeps trying to get at you from the back to disrupt your moves.  That's fair game and to be expected.  What I hadn't expected was that you would have a game camera that steadfastly refuses to look where you want it to.  Sixty per cent of the time, I'm swinging at enemies behind me when I can't even see them, because the camera idiotically stays in its own angle, so that when you're battling a particularly powerful enemy, he could all of a sudden land someplace you can't see and you'd have to run around begging for the camera to go back to a 3rd-person perspective behind you so you know where you're going.  Also, the 360-degree pan when you execute a super move only serves to disorient your controls.  Maybe these camera problems serve to fulfill the game designers' feeble fantasies of being filmmakers, but in a game, it's just irritating.  The fighting \"system\" is pathetic -- lots of button mashing in all directions.  Most of your combos are useless because you're receiving attack from all sides, so you end up using one combination over and over because anything else would be suicide.  So I played through the entire \"Shu\" story by doing one combo.  Yeah, I'm passing levels, but it's monotonous as hell.\nAs the Amazon editorial review noted, there's also a lot of running around in this game.  The programmers love designing level maps chock full of dead ends, forcing you to run all the way around to get where you want.  Even on horseback, it takes friggin' forever.  And then there's the game's charming tendency to magically make three powerful enemy platoons appear right beside your commander whom you're supposed to protect...if you happen to be launching an attack against the enemy base at that time and can't find a horse, good luck.  Oh yeah, and the enemy can do the ol' \"block you to death\".  I had Cao Cao cornered with only 5 per cent of his health left, and all he did was put his back to the mountain, hold down block against all my eight bodyguards and myself, and waited for five minutes straight until troops from his side appeared right beside my commander and took him out in a flash.  This was 95 per cent through the level.  Call this fun?\nI've been able to advance very well through this game, but it's really not a good gaming experience.  And I'm willing to bet Dynasty Warriors 5 is just on the horizon...with the exact game mechanics.  Koei has made it a habit of releasing the same game over and over without making any real improvements on sequels, so I seriously doubt I will ever play another Dynasty Warriors game again.","summary":"Awful camera, repetitive controls...what else is new?","unixReviewTime":1086739200,"vote":"2","style":{"Platform:":" PlayStation2"},"image":null}

So I went and bought a walkthrough guide, took three days and completed everything.\nAnd I'm sorry to say, I now think less of Heather and her ensemble cast of cliched characters than I did before.\nSH 3 is a game only to be played by fans of the series, and even then, only if those fans can get it cheap. It follows the story of Heather, a young girl thrown into a nightmare world of androgynous, ambiguous creatures and hellish ocations, in the search for who killed her father. Of course, there are plot twists, but only those of us that have completed SH 1 will understand them fully - and even then, they're about as predictable as a wino with a $10 bill outside a liquor store.\nThis game is all mouth and no trousers - or, in game terms, all graphics and no substance. I guess that criticisms against the PS 2 are fairly levelled, then, when people say Sony's developers aren't concentrating on originality anymore.\nSH 1 (on the PS 1) is a magnificent title, and, despite the now-poor graphics, still packs a creepy, dramatic punch, full of melancholia and tense atmosphere. Silent Hill 2 (PS 2) is an Opus, going far deeper into the psychology of fear than many films and novels do, and show exactly how affecting a Survival Horror game ought to be. It wasn't action-heavy, but was all the more affecting because of that.\nSH 3 does none of the above. It takes some highly-accomplished character models, throws them into anonymous backgrounds that lack character and originality, poorly-designed, and rehashes some of the best-loved levels from the prequels (as I remember, SH 1 had 2 hospitals listed on the map - why are we still stuck in the same one now??) and really pointless characters. Where are the endearing, innocent Cheryls and Lisa Garlands? The morose, powerfully enigmatic Angela Oroscoes? The magnificently disturbing James and Marias?\nMissing. And what we're left with is Heather (consummately annoying), Douglas (hopelessly underdeveloped as a character) and Claudia, a cult member whose total lack of reason and sense of purpose is matched only by the weakness of the game's 'explanation' of her raison d'etre.\nControls do nothing new, Survival Horror in this incarnation will always be a slightly flawed system, but does the job just fine. Sound is good, too, with the voice acting being of a slightly higher standard than before. Shame the script is so awful, then.\nI have played Silent Hill 2 repeatedly. I will not play Silent Hill 3 again. Five times through this mess is enough for anybody. If you're into gorgeous graphics without any substance or atmosphere, knock yourself out. If you're looking for something a little more mentally challenging, get Fatal Frame 2 or wait for Silent Hill 4.\nVery poor indeed.","summary":"Reviewed Review, New Opinion","unixReviewTime":1085011200,"vote":"11","style":null,"image":null}

But like someone before me mentioned, it was too easy -- I finished playing it in about 4 hours. There are too many hints and the clues are blatantly placed (even if you aren't into the game and you just want to win, all you have to do is drag your mouse over various areas and wait for the mouse pointer to turn green, collect the clues, and then it all comes automaticaly together). Spoon fed.\nI do think, however, if it was too hard, people would get frustrated with it. But for fans of forensic shows, or even someone who has basic knowledge, this game is a breeze. Which is frustating in itself, because you play the game, anticipating it getting harder with each level, and that just doesn't happen.\nHopefully if they make another version of this game, they'll take some time and think up more complex plots that require greater deduction in order to win.","summary":"Too easy, over fast","unixReviewTime":1064188800,"vote":"13","style":{"Platform:":" PC"},"image":null}

I have heard nothing bad about Neverwinter and with a second expansion coming out I bought Neverwinter Gold since it was the same price as Neverwinter.  I finished Neverwinter Night last weekend.  It was a great game.  I love every part of it.  It is the best representation of D&D in a computer game since the early days.\nBut....Shadow of Undrentide is seriously lacking.  First, you start out being \"trained\" as an adventurer.  My character was twenty second level by the time I start this add on so I would hardly say that a player of that level would be in that situation.  It seemed like the creators wanted this to be a separate game using the same game engine, but decided on an add on instead.  This can be the only reason for the next flaw, which is they dump the hench men from the original for a new set which are seriously lacking the depth of the original ones.  I only raise this issue b\/c Bioware brings back the original Henchmen for the next add on; Hordes of the Underdark.  So why else would they make this change in the middle?\nSo in short, this is a fair enough game if you buy the Neverwinter Gold edition, but do not waste you money on buying it on its on.  It is simply not worth the money.  I gave it two stars since this add on has my favourite prestige class, the Blackguard.

A 244 page script and an unprecedented 60 minutes of original cinematic footage was produced so gamers and movie watchers alike could learn the story of Ghost and Niobe (played by Anthony Wong and Jada Pinkett Smith.)  Their time on the big screen was limited, but their experiences in the game supplement the Matrix story and fill in gaps the movie left out.  The concept is pure genius, but the finished product ends up a failure because it's just not fun to play.\nFrom the start of the game, you get this unnerving feeling that developer Shiny Entertainment was in over their head.  The game engine itself has sub-par graphics considering its high system requirements and the number of bugs are atrocious (more on that later.)  I knock off another star for the bloated 3.6 gigs of hard drive space this game requires.  Running music and cutscenes off the CD's could have saved a lot of space, but we're not given this option.  Hard drives are cheap, but this is ridiculous.\nAfter spending the half-hour\/hour necessary to dump this behemoth on your hard drive, you'll find yourself starting out watching a movie clip involving Ghost, Niobe, and their cynical ship dwelling sidekick Sparks.  The clips are faithful to the movie and, to their credit, Shiny added well done computer animated cutscenes of their own.  Your first mission involves infiltrating a post office to pick up an important package.  From this point, Sparks whines about the difficulty of the mission (as he does throughout the game), you choose whether you want to be Ghost or Niobe, and the game begins.\nAs you proceed through the post office, prompts flash on the screen which provide \"tips\" on performing various functions such as controlling character movement and performing special fighting moves.  It would have been nice to simply hit a function key instead of Esc, select option, scroll down, select tip, etc... An extremely linear game, you're subjected to following a green arrow at the top of the screen which points which direction you should be headed, punching and kicking cops and security guards along the way.  After reading twenty tips and punching and kicking 100 security guards as you follow your little green arrow, you find you have returned right back where you started.  In fact, you'll run in circles three times just to complete the first level.  In another level, you run from one end of a level to another to flip a switch and turn a conveyor belt on.  Halfway back, you get a prompt saying someone turned the switch off.  As a result you have to retrace your steps and repeat the process all over again.  Other levels have you climbing staircases all the way up to the top floor of some factory, running to the other side of the room, then climbing staircases all the way back down again.  This mind-numbing backtracking is a persistent problem throughout the game.\nCharacter movement is mostly annoying.  Yes, you can slow things down to the now famous bullet-time and hit special key combinations to perform cool moves, but here's the problem.  It takes a lot longer to perform these moves and you're subjected to so many faceless, nameless cops and security guards that it's quicker just to run up to them and mash buttons until you knock them out and move on.  Considering lost health restores automatically by standing still long enough, it's easier this way too.  Even more problematic, the game tries to think for you when you've got your guns drawn and you end up firing at stuff you're not even aiming at.  In one level, I was supposed to destroy three control panels.  I stood pointing directly at them at point blank range while my bullets were wildly firing in every direction other than straight ahead.\nBugs are prevalent.  You'll run into clipping problems (heads and arms appearing through walls) and unrealistic gameplay issues, like a door or elevator not working until you've killed every guard in the room.  In one level, I got to my objective (a telephone) before everyone was eliminated and found myself completely unable to continue the game or even move away from the telephone.  Best I could do was shut down and start over.  Sound issues are a problem for those with EAX and cutscenes are lower in volume than the sound effects.  You'll find yourself playing with the volume knob a lot.  At times, the game muted my sound card for no apparent reason at all.  A patch addresses some, but not all of these problems.\nMost laughable are the so-called driving sequences.  Pretty much the only difference between playing as Niobe or Ghost, completing these levels is an exercise in frustration.  As Niobe the driver, the view is limited and the controls are sluggish.  As Ghost, riding shotgun with a shotgun, Niobe's driving is so bad you're safer keeping yourself inside the vehicle.  Strangest of all are the other cars on the road, violently gyrating left and right even at a complete standstill.  You'd think they were filled with horny teenagers.\nAfter about an hour of this inane running, killing, running, killing, and following the little green arrow just to watch the next cinematic, it dawns on you that that's all there is to this game.  Out of sheer boredom, I entered a cheat so I could avoid the guards and get through the cinematics.  Even the current Hollywood fad of girl-on-girl liplocking (Monica Bellucci and Jada Pinkett Smith) couldn't keep me interested.\nAll this said, I still think the Wachowski Brothers had the right idea.  If the right developers (Id, Valve, EA, Monolith) were involved, this could have been impressive.  Unfortunately, Shiny Entertainment couldn't hack the Matrix, and neither should you.\nHope the review helped.","summary":"The concept is innovative, but ultimately the game isn't","unixReviewTime":1064275200,"vote":"11","style":{"Edition:":" Standard","Platform:":" PC"},"image":null}

Jen is taken to these realms by Scree, a gargoyle, and told that she must restore order to the realms in order to save her boyfriend.  There are four of these realms, and the graphics are very good, the environments are very creative, and there's a lot of exploring to do.\n\nThe first realm is mostly a forest at night, though there is also a city, coliseum, underground caverns, etc.  I didn't care for this realm too much, it's very maze-like and I spent the whole time having no idea where I was supposed to go or what I was supposed to do when I got there.  The second realm is underwater, and you'll spend the whole time swimming.  It's also very tough to navigate as you have to go from place to place and it's a big puzzle as far as how to get there.  At least the mission was straightforward, you have to achieve a number of objectives one after another.  The third realm was by far my favorite, you travel through an incredibly gloomy village and eventually wind up in a marvelous castle.  It was worth it for the scenery alone.  The fourth realm was so-so, it's a bunch of underground volcanic caverns and you'll spend a lot of time trying to get from one place to another.  The challenge in this level is fun though.\n\nProbably the biggest problem with the game is the combat - it's the most basic button mashing imaginable.  Just press R2, over and over and over.  By the end of the final boss battle I though the middle finger on my right hand was going to fall off.  You basically get one weapon on each level and use it throughout, so there's absolutely no strategy when it comes to combat.  Though to be fair, in the third realm you could run away from your enemies, then get a powerup from your gargoyle pal, kill one enemy, get another powerup, repeat until they're all dead.\n\nThe story is another problem - you start out trying to save your boyfriend, but spend the whole game trying to restore order to the demon realms, which doesn't seem to have much to do with the original story setup, and left me feeling totally uninvolved.  They should have just ditched all the boyfriend stuff and instead come up with a different setup that would have made more sense and been more relevant.\n\nOverall, good graphics and characters, lots of (often frustrating) exploring, and repetitive combat.  It's a pretty game and some portions of it are certainly quite fun to play, but overall the bad outweighs the good.","summary":"Good graphics and characters, crummy gameplay","unixReviewTime":1189555200,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

The game had plenty of bonus features and special teams, cards etc. but misses on basic pieces to sports games that make them fun. Acclaim has always been somewhat of an overacheiver when it comes to games. They always seem to focus on one or two things and then miss the simple basic elements to a game that make them fun. The reason why many of us bought SNES and Genesis games when we were younger was not because they were realistic and full of features but because they were so basic that they were fun and exciting. SImply put ASB2004 is not exciting or fun, but becomes quite boring at times and makes you want to take it back to the store you got it from. There are plenty of other baseball games out there to fill your needs, this isn't one of them.\nASB 2004 is weak in one particular area that bugs me. The gameplay. While the chracter faces are done very good. The bodies have no texture to them, abd the physics in the game are very much laughable at. Sometimes when a great diving catch was done you may see it in instant replay. However when you see it, the outfielder or infielder may be 5 feet from the ball but somehow someway they are able to rob you of a great bloop single or a supposed to be double. This bothered me alot. It seemed like every hit i got was robbed from me and in a split second I could find myself looking at no hitter in favor of the cpu. Another bad thing about the game is the franchise mode can be a little annoying. Lets say you happen to lose a player to an injury and you want to add a minor leauger onto the roster. It can be very tiring just to add a minor leauger onto your team. Not to mention the fact that you have to add a new free agent to your team. Now this all may seem easy but trust me it's not. You will constantly be told that you have one too many player on the 40 man roster. You take that free agent off the team and now you have one too many! Ugh this got me mad enough to turn off my ps2 and go play something else. The only way to avoid this is taking injuries off or letting the cpu do it for you. Unfortuantley if ou let the cpu do it for you they most likely will change up the roster. Like if you had an AL team with a DH the DH may be changed because hes not hitting as well as a bench warmer when in reality you want the bad DH to hit so he can get experience. Or if you have 2 good 2nd basemen one lefty, one righty you may want to have the lefty to go up against right handed pitchers and the rightys vice-versa. All of this can be changed if you let cpu do things for you. It becomes very tiring and very boring at times.\nEven though ASB 2004 has its annoying moments it does shine at times. The commentary is done well, there aren't alot of repeats whisch is great. The special features are also excellent, there's plenty to do (it'd be even better if the gameplay was better but oh well) if you don't feel like playing a whole game or going into franchise mode. Sceanario mode is very good giving you actual games to change like a game where Piazza went 0-4 and his mets lost after being in a 4-4 tie, change that by getting the mets a win.\nAll in all ASB 2004 is very much worth a rent but not a buy. Try it out though (especially those who have been into the franchise for a long time.) It's not exactly a bad game just  game that needs alot of tweaking.","summary":"Acclaim tried a little too hard","unixReviewTime":1061769600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

As with any other MMORPG you create an account and pay your monthly fee. Next you create a character and log into the huge massive world. Perhaps the massive world is the only thing I liked about this game, as it was always a pure joy to just walk around and seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldy go where no other Everquest nerd has gone before! Honestly though I did find it fun and enjoyable to walk around the world.

I can tell you for a fact that it will take around 1,000 hours for most people. In order to get that valuable XP you have to kill animals and fantasy monsters. You do so by endlessly typing into your USB Keyboard (NEEDED ITEM!) asking for a group. Once in your group, you walk to an area to kill go kill these monsters. You kill monsters by pressing the X button. Each monster takes about 20 button presses. It takes about 500 kills to level up. To most sane people this is just too much. To top it off, if you cannot find a group, you cannot kill these animals and so the game becomes usless if there isn't anyone else playing. This game becomes very, very, very, stressful in the later levels, which is why I canceled my account just days ago. As icing on the cake, the game graphics are very poor.

GOODWIN","reviewText":"This game was on my top 10 wish list for games I wanted. I could not wait for it to come out. Now that I have it, how dissappointing it was.\nWhen I first got Lords of the Realms 2, I played it the first day for 15 staight hours. It was my first taste of real time strategy and started my conversion from puzzle games to RTS and FPS games. With Realms 3, it took all of the good things from Realms 2 and got rid of them. You can no longer control the resources you collect like rock, trees, and your food. You now place a vassal on a vacant plot and you get either gold or food. Thats it. You also can't raise an army. The only way you can get an army is to place a Knight on a vacant plot or buy mercanaries. But if you don't own enough land, you can only have so many Knights or you will not have enough money or farms. If you are short on farms, your army will abandon you. The longer your Knight is on the board, the more men he will collect, but it takes a very long time to collect a very small amount of men. You used to be able to control your lands easier and make your city grow, then raise an army. But not now.\nThe most irritating thing is fighting. If you go to an enemies lands and take out his farm, if you don't leave an army back, they will instantly place another vassal for a farm. Even if you take out their castle, you still can't take over their land until you do more damage to their land.\nThe next irritating thing is the armies. You can kill all of the enemies armies which leaves his plot open. He will then place another Knight to replace his beaten Knight and then attack you and somehow he has an army twice your size. I beat one enemies Knights completely 3 straight times and he still came back with 2 large armies and force me from his land. Not sure how that happened as I went through every Knight of the Realm and never found a large army once. When an army takes damage, their color changes. When they get to red, they are discouraged and they disband during the fight. So how he can keep coming back is beyond me becasue your army needs time to heal.\nAnd the last irritating thing is the battles. It seems like every time I go to the battle screen, another army attacks my lands. That is because there is no pause in the game when try to fight the battles yourself. If you let the computer do it for you, you lose alot more than you should plus you don't get to play the game. There needs to be a pause during battles so you can enjoy the game more. You also can't build siege weapons. You have buy siege mercanaries. Not cooll at all.\nThe games doesn't totally suck. It is challenging (although very repititious) and the graphics are pretty good (although I haven't been able to see the intro movie or any other cutscenes even thought I downloaded the patch. not sure whats up with that), but that is about it.\nIf they plan on making another, they better go back to what worked for Realms 2 & 3 and incorporate it in Realms 4, otherwise this franchise is dead if it isn't already.","summary":"I was dissappointed.","unixReviewTime":1084233600,"vote":"64","style":null,"image":null}

I can only assume that it gets an extra 3 automatically for being the sequel to the \"1999 Game of the Year\" (as Sierra is so fond of advertising).\nI'm a big fan of the Homeworld series and enjoyed the two previous installments greatly, so needless to say I was quite looking forward to cracking open HW2.  The demo wasn't exactly inspiring, I wasn't really fond of some of the modifications that were made to the game's basic formula.  Namely the inclusion of unit \"squadrons\" and a more emphasised \"paper-rock-scissors\" balance scheme.  Even so, I managed to talk myself into shelling out 40 bucks for the game... d'oh!\nDespite all the \"its too hard!\" comments floating around, I was undaunted, I don't mind a challenge.  Unfortunately, the challenge in HW2 is afforded mostly by a test of how fast you can click your mouse and navigate around the (nicely updated) interface.  A typical campaign mission in HW2 consists mostly of you constantly trying to repel a ceaseless barrage of enemy ships... while trying to complete both your mission goals, AND without sucking up every single resource unit on the map before you get there.\nI'm giving it 3 stars, for the following things:  Graphics, Sound, Design, and an at least moderately fun Skirmish mode.  Everything else, in my humble opinion, is just nonexistant.  I shudder to think how well a newcommer would fare in HW2, I consider myself a pretty decent RTS gamer and I still find it a frustrating experience. Not to mention, there is only a single campaign, rather than one for each faction... I hope this doesn't become the next RTS trend.\nIn short, HW2 has everything going for it except what matters - gameplay.  I play games to relax and enjoy, not to be irritated and driven out of my mind.  Very disappointed, I hope Relic lets Barking Dog Studios (who did HW: Cataclysm) handle the next installment of this series.","summary":"Let's be objective","unixReviewTime":1067731200,"vote":"25","style":{"Platform:":" PC"},"image":null}

Just today i started playing it again, and i remembered why i stopped playing.\nI guess the biggest flaw is this game is HARD.  For some reason it seems that pc games only have two settings these days: easy and impossibly hard.  This game is definatly the latter.\nThe units in this game are evolved around the old silly theory that one unit is strong versus an other type of unit, but completly helpless against some other type.  Which always seemed rather stupid to me.  A .50 m2 machine gun was designed to be an anti-vehicle weapon.  Does that mean it's completly useless against personnel?  Uh no...it just happens that it's MORE effective against personnel, because of its obvious over-powerment.\nSo In the game you have to figure out what the enemy's strengths and weaknesses are, and exploit them with the appropriate unit.  However...the enemy rarely has just one type of unit, in fact it usually has a pretty well rounded force.  So you have to create a well rounded force yourself to deal with them.  However the enemy is much faster than you, and can pick and chose your ships while you're trying to make sense of the battle.  It amazes me every time how surgical the ai is when it comes to wiping out your force.  You'll have a large, well rounded group one second, then notice the enemy is targeting solely one type of unit of yours.  Once that unit type is gone, you're force is essentially crippled as it now has a large hole in it that can be easily exploited.  It amazes me how the enemy can target those single unit types in a group of 50 other ships, when you can barely even SEE what types of units are in their groups.\nAdd this to the fact that the enemy also has unlimited recources and ships, and you have a rather frustrating puzzle.\nEvery mistake you make is cumulative as well.  You cant just barely win a battle.  As you'll go into the next battle with basically no units.  You always have to find a way to win the battle without crippling your chances for the next battle.\nThe battle really does not give you much time to think either.  You have a research capability to improve your units...but you're rarely given a single uneventfull minute to figure out what you want to research.\nThe graphics in this game are pretty stunning...i guess.  I run a high end computer (2.6 p4, 1 gig ddr ram, geforce ti 4600 128 mb ddr ram) and the graphics are still EXTREMELY choppy in parts.\nIt's ok if you zoom all the way out, but if you zoom close into the ships everything becomes choppy and the game slows down significantly.\nThe story completly escapes me.  I read the little overview of the story in the manual, and i still have no idea what the game is talking about.  I never played the original homeworlds, so sue me.\nOverall...it's just another game i have around that takes up space.","summary":"Just another game i WANT to like","unixReviewTime":1066435200,"vote":"18","style":{"Platform:":" PC"},"image":null}

I agree with them completely about the first half of it, it's fun, it's pretty. The graphics, control system, and gameplay are all very good. And for the beginning, the story is excellent.\n\n Where I disagree is in the rest of it. The second half of the game involves amazing amounts of guesswork, and very little encouragement, making the game lose most all of it's wonderful momentum. I started out overjoyed and having fun, then it all drained away.\n\n Every time I started really enjoying myself - in a fight, a jumping puzzle, a dungeon crawl, I ran into something that just got in the way of it. Most often, it would be something that was tricky to figure out, and then you get that proud feeling when you do, but then doing what you figured out proved tedious and aggravating. I was ok with the sailing, I liked the graphics, I liked the story, and I liked the controls; but this game was designed in large part by a sadist. I've heard reviewers say it was easy, a lot of it is, but the parts that aren't are not difficult because the puzzles are complicated, they're just designed to be just hard enough that knowing what you have to do was less than half the battle.\n\n I've played every Zelda game made, they've all had nasty tricky puzzles, but this is the first one where the puzzles are harder to complete than to figure out. Last time I checked, the point of a puzzle was solving it, not writing down the solution.\n\n The story is all right, most notably because it is different from every other Zelda game made before. The unique flavor adds a lot to it, but the story remains pretty sparse considering the amount of leg-work between plot moments.\n\n I have to say, having played through the entire game and gotten through every side quest, that it's good aspects are seriously hurt by it's overly irritating nature.\n\n (Plus, one of the characters you have to rely on very heavily not only empties your purse, but is just damned obnoxious, good old pal Tingle!)","summary":"Every time I started to have fun, the game got in the way","unixReviewTime":1167177600,"vote":"4","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Shelton","reviewText":"Think back the fall of 1999 when \"The Blair Witch Project\" was released.  The elitist movie critics were in a full-fledged campaign to convince the public and themselves that the movie was the best thing since \"Citizen Kane\".  Back in 1999 so much praise was showered on the film that the voices of dissent were drowned out and ridiculed.  Then a funny thing happened: time passed.  Like the rest of the superficial Hollywood crowd, the elitist critics have moved on and this has allowed people to freely rethink the movie.  Now it's hard to find anyone who's filling to admit they liked the \"Blair Witch Project\".  Why do I mention that?  Because the story's nearly the same when it comes to the near universal praise of Nintendo's \"Wind Waker\" game.\n\nSince \"Wind Waker\" is a Zelda game, and since the Zelda franchise is amazing, the \"Wind Waker\" must be amazing too, right?  Right? Unfortunately, no, but equally disturbing is how the gaming community answered \"yes\" to that question.  They went into a full-fledged campaign to convince themselves, and the public, that this game deserved a pedestal next to \"Link to the Past\" and \"Ocarina of Time\".  Only now, years after its release, do I hear consistent complaints about the game.  Below is a list of problems with the game:\n\n1) The sailing aspect of the game takes up at least 50% of the adventure and it is extremely tedious.  Nintendo didn't even attempt to streamline this process.  You can literally set your direction, put the controller on the floor, and sit back and watch the minutes pass as Link sails along to your destination.  In order to further extend the playtime of sailing, the user is forced to embark on numerous mini-quests where many must be performed numerous times through the game.  The most annoying are the \"fetch quests\" where you dredge the ocean floor for items.  *Yawn* Are we having fun yet?\n\n2) The game consists of only a few dungeons, and some of them are extremely easy.  Important aspects of the game were replaced with time-consuming fetch quests from the ship.\n\n3) The game has an unexploited storyline.  I can think of numerous examples of storyline elements that seem like they should conclude in something big, but completely fizzle out.  (Between this and the lack of dungeons, I am convinced this game was rushed to market)\n\n4) I might as well say it: the graphics are terrible but otherwise fit the overall-quality of the game.  The Link model is the worst: a massive head, massive eyes, and eyebrows that somehow float over his hair.  At least you spend most of your time staring at the back of Link's head.\n\n5) Before release we were told that the NPC (non playable characters) were going to be far more advanced than others we've seen in the past.  I have no idea where Nintendo got off promoting that idea because they are identical in sophistication to those in OoT and just about every video game I've played.  They certainly aren't as interesting as those from Majora's Mask.\n\n6) And I've just grown tired of games where you must constantly switch between the game and an item selection submenu.  Metroid didn't need this and neither did Star Fox Adventures.  I'd love to see Nintendo incorporate something that would minimize this behavior in their Zelda games.  The problem is especially bad in The Wind Waker because an entire item slot is wasted on the sail.\n\n7) Fighting non-boss enemies is extremely easy.  Just Z-target and swing your sword for a few moments and the green A button icon will change to a green star and flash.  Press the button when this happens and Link does an incredible feat of acrobatics and destroys his foe.  It looks awesome, but you quickly learn that this ability makes it extremely easy to fight nearly anything.  It also makes the game feel like its playing on autopilot and you are just a bystander watching.\n\nSo this is a review for those interested in Twilight Princess.  Whether your itching for a Zelda fix while waiting for TP or have played and enjoyed TP and want more Zelda, I've just gotta warn you that Wind Waker is not worth the trouble.","summary":"Tedious and overrated","unixReviewTime":1159142400,"vote":"9","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Unfortunately, many people seem (for some unknown reason) to have been won over by the game after its release; I, however, found the disappointment of playing this game to be exactly commensurate with my expectations.\n\nI decided to give the game an honest chance; I thought, \"Just look at it as Ocarina of Time with different graphics and different levels.\" Sadly, the only thing carried over from OoT were the horrible controls (funny how technology advances and Nintendo still can't manage to achieve correspondence between controller inputs and character actions; oh well...), though one could stretch a point and say that OoT did introduce gratuitously bizarre new elements to the Zelda world (the Goron race comes to mind), but TWW takes this to such an extreme that I cannot forgive it for its eccentricities as I did OoT.\n\nTWW is boring and embarrassing. Boring because the story has virtually no connection to the prior Zelda games, so the hardcore fan really has to make a mental leap to even consider this as continuous with the other games. Boring also because the game starts out with sheer tedium; it took what seemed like forever to get the sword, only to lose it in the first level. And the game actually starts out with a Gerudo Fortress-like level where one must evade detection. One would think that Shiggy would start the game out with the most fun and pleasant puzzles he possibly could, to encourage immersion in the game before challenging the gamer's patience, but the worst trials of my patience came right at the beginning of the game.\n\nThe game is embarrassing because it is extremely immature in a way reminiscient of Majora's Mask. I'm not sure if it's just the way the Japanese design games, but the bizarre childish characters and graphics were very off-putting. While I'm on the subject, the graphics are terrible. There is no sense that this is a Zelda game; it's a cartoon. There is certainly no sense of darkness in the game either, something every Zelda game before this has had. The game is very lighthearted and giddy and yet tedious. Excellent combination for boring me to death.\n\nI kept playing, hoping for a break to the boredom, but it never came.

It was one of the best games I have ever played.  But what happened here?  Its like a wanna be paper Mario, or something.  The new graphics all the magazines claim are \"revalutionary\" are really really sad.  The puzzles and stuff in Wind Waker borrow too much from OOT.  They basically took the old ones and stuck them here in the hopes that noone would notice they are the same.  The fighting is all right, but it wasn't as satisfying as previous titles.\nOverall, its not that bad of a game.  Its zelda, so its got to have some value.  However, it just wasn't the old run around with Link and kick butt feeling.  It was more of a ride a boat with a geek and hit people with a stick feeling.  Rent it, don't buy it.

I was like the game is older but has great reviews and the screen-shots\/videos looked good enough. But I should have listened to my inner voice trying to warn me that there must be a reason that this game never got a expansion or sequel. Even though I got the game at a really low price but after playing it for few days I regret even spending that money. Anyways here is what ails & doesn't ail me;\n\nCONS\n\n1)Repetitious to the nth degree. You do get to visit different worlds but other than a scenery change the missions are the same over & over. You pretty much fly to a way-point; dog-fight with pirates or attack other ships, maybe destroy a space-station sometime, you can also mine or destroy a derelict ship to get upgrades for your vessel but in the end all these missions are just variations of the basic premise of a space-shooter on rails.\n\n2)If you want to be a trader, or pure mine or find some other non-combat way to advance your character that is not really possible. The game is designed in a way that for you to progress beyond star systems you have to complete part of the required story-line as well as have certain threshold of money. That is only possible via doing combat missions of the main plot\/side-quests otherwise you will not have enough money or enough progression to move to the next zone. So in all this is at-heart a pure action space rpg.\n\n3) They are also 4-5 npc's at best in the game who you will meet all over the galaxy saying almost the same dialogue and handing you over essentially the same missions just worded differently.\n\n4) Even though you will be visiting different planets, sectors etc. you really can't travel anywhere other than pre-assigned rooms where the above mentioned npc's gives you newer missions making the game feel confined rather than open-world.\n\nPROS\n\n1) Graphics of space-ships, stations, planets etc. are impressive and holds well even to this day.\n\n2) You can upgrade your ship with armaments, equipment or buy better ships over-time which gives a decent rpg feel to the game.\n\n3) The cut-scenes (though repetition abounds here too) helps propel the story and gives the game that quint-essential rpg feel.\n\nIn the end this is a ambitiously conceived sci-fi rpg yet a poorly executed game. I actually came here expecting a Eve offline but alas it's more of a action rpg that is designed for people looking for immediate gratification.\n\nEDIT: I got my hands on X3:Terran Conflict and it's the space sim that I have been looking for a long time. If you are looking for a open-ended, single player space simulator rpg with incredible visuals or essentially a Eve Offline than check out Egosoft's X-series games.","summary":"Repetitious and ultimately a shallow game","unixReviewTime":1336003200,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

Powell","reviewText":"...and that gets old pretty quick with the relatively small universe. I think everyone should just face what this game is. It's a repetitive, boring, gameplayless wreck. You spend more than half the game flying from place to play hitting the F3 key to jump in trade link after trade link. Calling this open-ended is a total joke. There really are only three things you can do, you can be a fighter, trader, or pirate. The most interesting, of course, is the fighter. You get missions to do, but unfortunately, every. single. one. is go here, and fight these ships, and possibly a base and turrets. You can always buy better ships and the ludicrously powerful hidden ships, but doing missions nets in a pitiful amount of cash, so you'll be forced to start the game being a trader. Being a trader defines mediocrity. You travel from place to place clicking buy, then clicking sell at another place. This nets the easiest cash so you can buy a better ship of your choice later. The next step up to a flying joke is being a pirate. Choosing this occupation serves no purpose. The point is to destroy other ships, preferably trading ships, and taking their cargo. The cash you can receive this way is pathetic, and if you choose this, everyone will hate you and you won't be able to dock many places. Since the whole idea is to destroy trading ships and hit that button that tractors in cargo, this gets old reeeaaaal fast. You can't even dock on the other ship and hijack it, even when disabling them. If they decide to make a sequel, there absolutely HAS to be a more personal ship, something you can wander around in, and for heaven's sake it has to be bigger than the teeny-tiny ships you get, even the supposedly massive trading ships are pathetically small. I would also love to see multiplayer done better, it would be a godsend if you could board and hijack other ships as a pirate, or just to climb aboard someone else's ship or dock on a trading ship to get a free ride somewhere, and to act as a deployable fighter escort. Rather than acting as a ship, it should be more as acting as a player, one that can contribute to other players. Anything would do. Being able to assign roles to people on ships, particularly trade ships, would be wonderful. A deeper systems management would be great, someone to worry about the engine powers and to fix any malfunctions, someone to worry about the weapons and the power they sap up, and someone to worry about steering. To think about the huge amount of things they could've done with this game, it's sorry to see how short they sold themselves, particularly considering the development time. Next to worthless.","summary":"The fun is in the exploration...","unixReviewTime":1080864000,"vote":"5","style":null,"image":null}

I got bored of it in just a few months. Basically, the game is about when you are trying to get a position of a fighting actor or actress by the director who has been a complete failure.\n\nThe GOOD THINGS about Kung Fu Chaos:\n\nThe selection of things to do- Instead of just fighting, you have adventure mode, and also a fighting time where you fight about 15 minutes and see how many people you have killed for the last 15-30 minutes.\n\nThe creativity- The creators did a great job of making up places where they would have auditions. Falling down a escalator then explodes and all of that kind of stuff. It is very cool what they did with that.\n\nThe BAD THINGS about Kung Fu Chaos:\n\nReplay value- Basically, replay value means how long you will be willing to play it. This game has a bad replay value. I stopped playing it in a few months. I found another game and started playing that instead.\n\nThe controls- When you first play, it should be a little bit diffucult about how this game is supposed to be played. Instead, there are so many controls that you don't know what to do. It took me a good week to understand the controls.\n\nThis game is alright for the price.

But it's pretty much exactly the same anyway.\n\nFirst off, I hated how hard it was to stay alive in the first level. I went searching for codes on the Internet and surprisingly there is no codes, F.A.Q's, walk throughs, help guides ...nothing! (Ignore a code that says if you pause the game and type \"best kept secret\" it makes you immortal. It does not work at all)\n\nI managed to find a site that had a download to run during the game that gives you max energy, power and ammo (invisibility). Found at [...] download that trainer thing. I give it 5 stars for working flawlessly.\n\nNow that I couldn't be killed (except when I got squished in a thing) I was free to test out Robocop. I thought the game was pretty good. I played a level each day cause I'd have enough by the end of each level. I loved getting to level 3 and confronting ED-209. the graphics are decent 3D stuff. The quotes are amusing for a while, especially when you kill a good guy and Robo says, \"sowwwwwwreeeee\"\n\nHowever, a few of the levels I really grew tired of. Playing out like a Duke Nukem\/Doom kinda game, it kinda got annoying on a level down in a mine where you have to destroy all the boxes before a certain door will open. A map would really help navigation out instead of wondering around till you wing it. The levels are too big to become instantly memorable so that you know where everything is in future. Sometimes they're just confusing as hell or annoying.\n\nCONTROLS\nThe controls aren't that bad. You use your mouse to aim and shoot. The right button can be changed; I used it to open doors. You use your arrow keys to move. And various other keys do different things; Like a zoom feature. Or press 1 on the num pad to make Robo twirl the gun around.  \"Can you do that, dad?\"\n\nGRAPHICS\nCompared to similar sort of games like Duke Nukem, GoldenEye, Wolfenstien ect... this ones nice on the graphics in its own way, the 3D graphics look awesome on some stages, others there quite boring. Tho, some stages have had more time and effort put into them. In some stages sometimes you can shoot various things like lights, signs, cars and things, but on other stages there just a graphic. Ed-209 looks great, but there are some things added for the hell of it I think. I didn't understand what a giant rat in a sewer was about. It's like someone developed a rat on their computer and decided to put it in a game just to see what it would look like.\n\nThe videos look dodgy. I'm ok with it that they're just to tell the story. But they looked like they where made and then there was no room left to add them to the game after it was completed so they got compressed to hell to fit on the disc.\n\nSOUND\nA lot of people complained about the sound of this game. I didn't complain about much of it. I didn't take much notice of the music, the quotes where amusing for a while. But in the end I was just playing without the sound on. It doesn't help with anything you need to do.\n\nLEVEL 9\nOverall the game was OK until the last level. For starters, it took me a few minutes to work out what the hell I was supposed to be doing. It seems Robo freezes in spot while you wait for the bad robot to climb into his diplodocus neck, robotic machine. You cant skip this bit which sux for this reason; Once you've killed the robot by standing in the middle and shooting at the red things on the neck when it's shooting its lasers at you; the robot dies, it plays a video and then you have disarm the bomb going off in one minute. You walk to 8 different machine's and choose which code you think de-activates it. If you get 3 wrong, the whole lot restarts and you have to do them again. I thought I might find the correct codes out first, write them down and then restart the level and get them right. But nope! After waiting boringly for the robot to start up, I finally got back to the bit to disarm them, and what do you know, codes aren't the same! That really sux when you can't finish the game without LUCK on your side. There is no skill I could find to it other then a good memory, you just have to be lucky to get through it. Other wise the clock runs down and Robo says, \"OH, S###\" and the whole city blows up. Yet some cop is still alive to say \"I wouldn't want you on my team, go back to the police academy\" then you have to wait too long for that robot to start up again when you start the level again and for me, I have no patience, i want to get into these things instantly, not be made to wait.\n\nOVERALL:\nThe game was fun to begin with. I thought it was cool. That was until I clocked it. And realised it has no replay value. Once you beat the game there is nothing to do. Why it lets you save it after you've beaten it is beyond me, cause all it does is lets you see the crappy 2-second ending of a TV report and then goes back to the main menu when you load your saved game. What's the point of that? You can go back and re-do missions you didn't get all the stuff for, and maybe when you do that and get them all 100% complete it unlocks something? But quite frankly I don't care if it does or doesn't, I'm done playing it. Once I beat it, I had no desire to play it again. It was cool while it lasted, but nothing to redeem it like other shoot em ups have had. Plus, something other then walking around shooting would've helped the game a bit. Like driving, boating, flying, something other then 9 levels of the same thing.\n\nSomething that I heard about this game was that they had ignored the movies part 2 and 3 and said this was like they hadn't existed. This was the follow up to the original movie. Honestly, I couldn't tell AT ALL. I didn't see anything that looked familiar at all apart from ED-209 and Anne Lewis of OCP. (so ignoring the fact she got killed in the sequel is reason enough to say that stuff is it?)\n\nPROS\n- Decent graphics\n- fun quotes\n- huge levels\n- good controls\n\nCONS\n- sux without the cheats to stay alive\n- levels can be too big to be bothered navigating\n- no replay value\n- no ending after completion\n- no multi player mode\n- not enough levels\n- needed something other then just walking and shooting all the time\n- Needs more guns\n- No spike (that thing in Robo's hand)","summary":"PC version review (same game)","unixReviewTime":1147392000,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

However that's enough to know this game is worth only $..., not $....\nThe shooting action and killing action are fairly [bad].  When you shoot, you don't get the sense that your doing the shooting.  It feels more like your pushing a button on a controller which is activating an animated gun on your television screen.  The same is true for when you hit someone (shooting them).  When you hit a bad guy they just fall-no dust blowing off of their jackets or blood. If you played and liked Medal of Honor or the oldies like 007 goldeneye(N64)or Perfect Dark(N64), then you will be disappointed.  I consider realistic gunshots(a sense of recoil and power coupled with good sound effects) to be the most important element of a good 1st person shooter, if that [is bad] then there is not much worth playing for.\nOtherwise the graphics were just OK.  Nothing to right home about.  Controls were decent, learning curve pretty short (10min).\nOverall this game brings nothing new to 1st person shooters.  It would have been better if released in May 1995.

You could do neat little tricks like cartwheeling while blasting away your enemies, cool hand to hand combat moves, and of course, do it all in slow motion.  But the fun ended shortly, just like the game.\n\nThe game quickly got repeditive.  There was only a small number of moves in your aresenal, and once you used them a couple of times, it got boring.  And, like the fun, the game stopped as abrubtly.  I finished the game in one afternoon, then found out you could play as another character, which was stupid anyway because the gameplay with different characters was only MILDLY different at best, usually only a different setting, and then beat the game again the same afternoon.  The multiplayer was boring because it was only hand to hand combat which got old fast.\n\nOverall, the game is somewhat amusing, for about a day.  Not much more fun after that.  There's no replay value iun the game, not an ounce.  And to top that off, the coolest thing you can do is run on walls at r e a l l y s l o w s p e e d s.

The hacking section was a good idea, but in the end fairly pointless.  Unlocking the multiplayer was cool until you realized that the characters you coudl fight with in these new environs didn't have the \"focus\" (bullet time) feature enabled, so they just did regular kicks, punches and throws...all of which, by themselves, was not up to industry par in a game with this much buzz.

I don't like this because that leaves two sources to go through to get the movie. The game was rushed to market and there are many, and I do mean many glitches and bugs in game. Many levels are just your characters walking through a hall way but here's the kicker. The game controls are old school. ONE ANALOG STICK controls your character. That leaves the camera in automatic and yes there are times you can't turn around to fight an enemy behind you. There are some glitches like the Sewer flashlight thing that can be worked around. You can't move forward without the it. Yet, you can't pick it up. (shoot some rounds off of your MP5). The way-point arrow is slow and deceptive. It doesn't point to where you really want to go and when you get there resets to another location entirely.

I'm not too big of a Matrix fan. I thought the first movie was great and I thought the sequel to be kind of a flop. The game Enter The Matrix, in my opinion, follows the second movie down the same dissatisfying path. To be fair, the graphics are great and the kung-fu\\gravity bending gameplay is unprecedented and fun to watch. The action moves you can perform play like some of the fight sequences in the films. Unfortunately, the action combos and the wall walking gets old really fast. After about an hour of doing the same martial arts combos and jumping over bullets I began to grow bored with the gameplay. I found myself doing the same thing over and over: Follow the trails, shoot the same guards, do the same moves. There is no variety in this game. You fight and easily kill dozens upon dozens of generic swat cops and security guards.  You easily get an auto-lock on your target, jump through the air and shoot them.... OVER AND OVER AND OVER, LEVEL TO LEVEL TO LEVEL. Gameplay is much too linear, and the lack of any sort of rush coupled with the same recycled orchestral music playing in an endless loop left me wanting more. The game didn't convey any real 'get up and go.' Just the same bad guys for you to kill in different rooms. In summary:\nPros: Great graphics, great gun and explosion sounds, exceptional gameplay as far as manipulating the environment(wall walking, bullet dodging etc..), Agents are intimidating and fun to fight, clever interposing between gaming and movie clips gives you a better understanding of The Matrix.\nCons: Poor lighting and shadows, TOTAL lack of variety from level to level, recycled enemies and recycled musical score resulting in monotonous levels of easy shoot-em-up gaming, Unchallenging combat interface: Enemies are weak and predicatble, lacking any sort of surprise tactics or skills equal to your own.\n If you're a fan of The Matrix and are just dying to get any sort of Matrix fix before the next film, then you will probably make this game work for you. If you're a first person shooter fan looking for anything to bridge the gap from now until Halo 2, maybe this title will keep you interested for a night or two. - It's no miracle in action gameplay.

I have loved 4x games since I played the first Civ, but this game leaves a lot to be desired. I get the impression that the designers were really focused on having a good AI (which is nice), but along the way they left out a lot of other things (which was not so nice). Galactic Civilizations seems much more like an experimental prototype for a later, more sophisticated release, rather than a fully developed game in its own right.\nOne thing that is completely missing is the ability to improve your territory. This is normally a big part of 4x games, and I never really realized how important it is to game play until now. During the course of the game you colonize planets, and each planet has a simple \"quality score\" that generally varies from 1 to 20. All planets of the same quality rating are exactly alike in game terms; you don't have some planets that produce a lot of trade resources, other planets that produce a lot of minerals, and so on. They are all just \"generic planets of quality X.\" I think this might have been acceptable (maybe) had this game come out in 1990... but for a game released in 2003, this is just not sufficient in my opinion. The interface is also not that great... sometimes it would be nice to able to use the keypad for maneuvering your ships, rather than the mouse. However, they didn't include keyboard shortcuts for commands, so you have to constantly switch back and forth from the mouse to the keyboard, or just give up and use the mouse constantly. Also, the game lacks many customization options: for example, you always play against the same 5 alien races, no matter how large or how small the galaxy is, and you can't turn off \"features\" like random effects that can have a huge effect on the game. There is no multiplayer option, which was puzzling a couple of years ago when Civ 3 came out without multiplayer but is almost unbelievable now. Finally, despite all the talk about the \"non-cheating AI\" the fact is that the computer players start out knowing the location of all the good star systems, while you have spend quite a few turns stumbling around trying to find good spots to colonize.\nAltogether I rate this as something of a disapointment: a good AI in search of a game.","summary":"Read the negative reviews carefully","unixReviewTime":1063584000,"vote":"92","style":null,"image":null}

Graphics looked great, and the ability to fly 60+ aircraft (including some real rare birds the like F-104 and the F-86) made this game appear all the more like an outstanding title. Well kids, It is not. Thankfully, I rented this one before I bought it. My biggest complaint the the control, or lack thereof, especially in the training missions. Completing the training missions is required to unlock various aircraft. Training missions consist of things like take-off, landing, rolls, loops and so on. Later training missions involve combat maneuvering, formation flight, and weapons. There are also training modules involving rotary-wing (choppers) and VTOL aircraft. Sounds fun and involved, right? WRONG!!! The training requires you to be so precise in your control, that even the slightest mistake will cause you to fail and re-take the \"test\". Yeah, I know that the REAL jet jockeys and chopper drivers go through the same thing, ... Maybe I'm just whining. Also, while you are in \"school\" you can be \"scrambled\" to respond to airborne threats. You may be required to simply identify and unknown aircraft, or you may have to shoot him down. You never know when you get the call. That part was kind of cool, although the radio voice vectoring me to the target did get a bit annoying. Other than that, I must admit, there were a wide selection of aircraft (all with Japanese Air Force markings) and great graphics. On one hand, I have been known to complain about the Ace Combat series of fighter plane shooters, stating that they are painfully unrealistic. But, I guess that there can be an overdose of realistic, and (in my opinion) this game suffers because of it. But again, the myriad of aircraft (including combat choppers and heavy transports) gave this game a nice variety, and prevented me from giving the dreaded one-star review.

At this point, you can K.O. them if they're weak, bu if they're strong, you'll probably end up losing the fight. You'll die over and over again in the same part, and get frustrated, and if you're like me, just put down the control and leave the game alone and never play it again. The graphics basically suck. No other word can describe them. They look like something from a Nintendo 64 game. This game had potentioal, but not enough belief in it from the creators.

What if we take our old amazing product, the Action Replay Max for the GameCube, and make it so that our buyers can no longer input their own codes!\nBoss: That's the dumbest, most shameful way of making money I can think of! Great idea!\n\n=__=\n\nSHAME ON YOU CODEJUNKIES! This version of AR does not allow users to put in their own codes. Oh, so you wanted to buy an Action Replay to play as Amy or Chaos 0 in SA2B like I did? Too bad! You have to deal with the codes you're given! That also means that if your game isn't even listed on the disc then you're totally screwed, because you don't even have the cruddy selection of codes you're given with the other games on the disc. The only way around this is to buy a copy of the GameCube AR Max that comes with a memory card for saving your new codes, which is rare and not currently in production. Prepare yourself for a hefty price tag ($100+) if you've got your heart set on one. This is made even more shameful due to the fact that other discontinued consoles (PS2) still have an AR Max in production, so you can add new codes on those, but not this one.\n\nThe only reason this isn't a one star review is because what codes you are given work well, without crashing, and there is also a freeloader on the disc, so that you can play imported games with or without codes. **Be aware that when saving imported game data, your memory card will be re-formatted to that region, and you will lose all of your save data currently on your memory card! Be sure to have an extra one and label it!**\n\nIf you're looking for a simple Gamecube cheat code device, this is really the only one available right now, and last I checked it IS compatible with my Wii, and I do play online with it. But BE FOREWARNED that you won't be able to do all of the cool stuff you see on YouTube. Hopefully one day CodeJunkies will turn their brains back on and start re-producing the AR Max again, but until then we can only hope and wait.","summary":"BOOOOOO!","unixReviewTime":1395187200,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Those giving this title 4 stars and over must not have played the THQ N64 WWE games, or are simply giving this game high stats for the characters and SOME decent models.  This game is loaded with horrible glitches.  It's almost hard to believe that THQ allowed this sloppy, choppy game out the door!  When the computer has a player down, they'll repeatedly proceed to do a routine number of stomps and pins (the player's character is left stunned for a few moments after being pinned, so they're basically left lifeless to the computer).  Also, on tag matches, when the player has an opponent pinned, their partner will often at times leap into the ring and stomp the opponent down on the mat pinned, breaking up the pinfall.  Seasonal mode was a good idea, but was executed very poorly.  The player is given choices to make during matches, but very few of them are carried out (with the exception of resting during matches) and end up  unsuccessful.  With no dialogue or voice-overs (with the exception of the chanting from the crowd and the ref's) the game just doesn't make the player feel like they're in total control of the action.  I often at times spotted my enemies intefering in my matches only to later find them helping me along to win the match.  Also, when the referee's count for the pin, they take an eternity.  Creating character's is pretty fun (there are some wonderful outfits, and designing arena lighting for character's is a blast along with custom soundtracks for theme songs) the player can create a ton. As of to date, Raw 2 may very well be the best wrestling game on xbox, however that's not saying much.  The game feels very rushed and when all is said and done, Raw 2 is simply a disappointing game that had high hopes.  Best if settled for a rental.  However, if desperate to own a WWE game on your xbox, it's probalby best to own a used copy of this game or wait impatiently for a better installment to arrive in the future on the xbox.

I wish the developers of Sonic Advance 2 had understood that. The Sonic games for the Megadrive\/Genesis were all platformers that relied as much on exploration and tactic as speed. There were hidden treasures to be found to reward you for exploring the well-designed levels, as well as considerable challenges facing you on your way. SA2 feels more like a roller coaster ride; a fun one, but ultimately that's it.\n\nThe basic level in this game is thus. You start with a countdown to 'GO!', at which point you take off at lightning speed unless you try to stop. It's impossible to explore. Even if you try to take but a few steps to explore for hidden treasures, you usually wind up triggering a hidden springboard that propels you down the nearest slide, thus far out of reach of your previous area. How are you supposed to find anything in a game constructed like that? The levels are designed with speed in mind, not gameplay. I have turned the time limit off just so I could explore the very first level for a port to the Special Stage. And after almost an hour of searching, I'd finally had enough. That was just the first stage, too; imagine how hard the other ones must be to find!\n\nThis game is all about the speed. It's quite obvious. The faster you go, the bigger a bonus you get at the end of a level. All boss fights take place while Sonic is running, and I admit that that is where the speed is an innovative feature, building on the first Robotnik boss battle in Sonic & Knuckles. For every other Robotnik fight, you rescue one of your three companions; Cream the rabbit, Tails and Knuckles the echidna (whose character is completely negated by having him been duped by Robotnik again). The short cinema screens after each of these battles are a welcome touch.\n\nIn fact, where Sonic Advance 2 shines is in its style. There are a lot of interesting courses; my favourite is an ice world with a city in the background, set during the night. There is also a fascinating hi-tech zone and of course Robotnik's Death Egg, whose battle is the toughest before getting to the final boss. The music is quite good but not inspiring or memorable enough to compete with other Sonic soundtracks. The final boss battle consists of all of Robotnik's battles in one go, plus a very final master robot battle which, in a completely contradicting fashion, brings you to a full stop. It's ironic that the game's final boss should finally wipe the grease off your shoes, but therein lies the challenge; suddenly you must revive your precision instincts from the Sonic classics. You might say it's too little, too late, though.\n\nThese are the game's best points. Sadly, Sonic Advance 2 doesn't allow you appreciate it to the fullest, because it just hurls you on at too much speed for you to be able to. It's a game ultimately lacking in any depth to be really rewarding to play. Speed is not what made Sonic great, and his games can't sustain themselves solely on that - Sonic Advance 2 is proof enough. The previous title, Sonic Advance, has a far better idea on what made Sonic great.","summary":"A Terribly Designed Game","unixReviewTime":1261008000,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

This is the second Action Replay I've purchased from Datel (the other being the Action Replay Max for PS2) and this is also the second time I am supremely disappointed.\n\nFirst, I'll say the good things. This Action Replay is tremendously more friendly than the ARMAX for my PS2. While it is impossible to enter new games and codes on the ARMAX (or hell, even codes for games that are already there), it is very much easy to do so on the GameCube AR. The second is that the interface allows for easy access.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. That's all the good things I can say about this package. My first problem with this AR is that there is no easy way to enter codes. If you make a mistake, then you have to use the C-stick to go back, but the damn thing moves ridiculously fast. The other problem is that if you hold A, then the letter you inputted will repeat itself. Why put this in? There is no code to which this would be a useful feature.\n\nFinally, my second and worst gripe is that there is no convenient way to input codes. I am NOT one of those guys who buys a cheating device and is content with the codes already there. I am an avid gamer who looks for the best possible codes, so I am constantly typing codes in. The problem here is that some of the best codes are extremely long. For example, the Resident Evil Inventory Editor code was 32 line long and it nearly killed me to put it in.\n\nNext, the other problem is with the included memory card. It is completely unstable. When I first used the AR, I was so happy that putting cheats in actually worked that I made the horrible mistake of forgetting that I was dealing with Datel. By forgettng this, I had also forgotten to back up all the cheats I created. So what happens? The memory card gets messed up and I had to reformat it, thus losing all my cheats, including the 32 line RE code. I kept in mind what happened and decided to re-input codes for SSB:M (debug codes, of course). What happened? I forgot I was dealing with Datel again. What I was going to do was backup the codes after I was done inputting it. Well, when I was done, I immediately turned off the GameCube and turned it back on with the lid opened so I can backup on two other memory cards. My day was completely ruined when I discovered that the Action Replay memory card needed reformatting again.\n\nFinally, my last gripe is that Datel has the worst code hackers I've ever seen. They have simple codes like infinite health, unlock everything, and stuff like that, but nothing truly special. By special, I mean codes like the Debug code. For those of you who don't know, debug codes allows you to have complete control over a game. For example, in Super Smash Brothers: Melee, you could use a debug code to play six players melee. And here is where the problems lies. You will NEVER see Datel input codes like that. This is why I recommend people to go to other Action Replay code sites, such as GSCentral or Action Replay Central. Don't bother using Datel's website, it is slow and useless.\n\nOverall, Datel is probably content with what it has because it has a complete monopoly over the cheating device market on the GameCube. There is no CodeBreaker here to challenge its dominance. GameCube players are stuck. Datel also released the Action Replay MAX for GameCube (most people don't know this) on their website, but it sucks just as much as this one. The only difference is that it has newer codes.\n\nI honestly wish that Pelican would release their awesome CodeBreaker device on the GameCube, but currently, there is no plans for that. I recommend the Action Replay ONLY because it is an excellent device to bring out the most out in any game, but I also recommend getting the MAX drive with it. The MAX drive will update your cheats quickly. Of course, this product is also made by Datel, so who knows? Not to mention it is also wildly expensive. If you plan on not buying the MAX Drive, then for the sake of your sanity, save your cheats on a regular memory card!","summary":"Datel never fails to disappoint in some way or another","unixReviewTime":1109030400,"vote":"47","style":{"Platform:":" Wii"},"image":null}

That's probably realistic, so no big deal.  However, the loving citizens also ignore your siren, routinely crash into your police car, and at one point after maybe a couple hours playing ran me and an AI controlled cop down in the middle of the street and kept going.

There may be a way to change the radio station, but I haven't found it yet.  That's a problem with the game, it doesn't have what you'd consider a real \"tutorial\".  A lot of stuff you'll only find if you read some guide or the hints on the load screen.\n\nAdd to that a shooting mechanic which is utterly awful, and a system of getting upgrades that punishes you if you fail the tutorial for getting them by deducting a badge, and it's like someone designed it to intentionally be frustrating.

The replay value consists of playing as Snoop Dogg. Whoop-de-stinkin-doo. The controls, while aren't the worst kind of controls, they definitely should have been tweaked better to outmatch GTA,MP, or DTR. The driving isn't bad, but it certainly not going to beat Grand Theft Auto. The fighting is very weak,depending on button-mashing more than skill and the moves are extremely slow, unlike Dead to Rights, which requires actual skill. And finally, the shooting. The aiming is cumbersome and will require patience and a keen eye. Plus, it rips off both Dead to Rights and Max Payne with the slow-mo dodge, but fails to outdo either one. Also, is it just me or does every pedestrian fight like they've spent time in a Shaolin temple? Believe me, you'll be in tears when you're getting (...)kicked by winos and Martha Stewarts-lookalikes.

One thing the driving does have on GTA is the ability to aim inside your car, which is neat too. The graphics are pretty good. The voice talent, consisting of Christopher Walken, Michelle Rodriguez and Michael Madsen, is interesting to hear. Unfortunately, the bad outweights the good.

I was not impressed by it.  It seemed mostly that the person that could hit the fire button the fastest was the winner.  No real strategy.  Seemed bland, and seemed to be missing something.  It was the same feeling I had when playing MechWarrior online.  It was fun the first couple of games, but just had no substance.  I've probably played over a thousand games of Halo online, and I still find it to be a fun experience.  At least you have to think and use strategy a little.\nAs for the story mode.  It was pretty [bad] also.  The graphics seemed ok, but the voice acting was pretty bad.  Also, I could have really seemed to care less for the story.  The whole game just couldn't hold my interest.  Really wish I would have waited for it to become a bargain game before I bought it.","summary":"Not what I was hoping for","unixReviewTime":1052697600,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

The story goes on from there to tell of the unearthing of a Sith artifact that could destroy the Republic.\nIn the game, you play as Obi Wan, Anikin, or Mace (Samuel Jackson). There are a variety of vehicles to pilot: hover tanks, land-walkers, droid tanks, speeders, and assault ships. And while all of that may sound like a lot - the game actually feels pretty constricted. Through most of the game, you're doing the same three things: straffing, firing missles, and occasionally zooming in on targets. (The exception being on 2 missions where the emphasis is on racing in your speeder, which is pretty cool).\nAlthough the cutscenes are pretty nice, the rest of the graphics are sub-par. The sound is pretty much straight from the movie, but you'll get annoyed at hearing blasters all the time.\nThis game is a fun little distraction. I beat it in about two days on the medium setting - which is not a long time at all.

The graphics are pretty much the same as The Getaway.  Anyway, you're playing the character of an annoying Asian guy who's mean as hell and somehow passed the psych evaluation test to become a cop.  The game is definately a knock-off on the whole GTA series, yet it's not as addictive or fun.  The gameplay isn't really a freeroaming thing, it's set up like The Getaway with levels where you can free roam, but you have a certain place to be, you just don't have to go there, which is what I prefer to do.  Since you're a cop, random crimes will pop up on the map such as, rape, gunfights, carjacks, illegal street racing.  These are the most fun since you are free to do what you want when dealing with these crimes.  A car chase might lead to a wreck, and then you'll be chasing the perpetrator on foot down the sidewaks as he shoots back at you hitting innocent pedestrians making the police experience very entertaining.  There's different ways you can deal with criminals, such as holding up your badge.  They might drop their guns, but if they've already downed a few uniform cops they'll probably ignore it, or run.  You can also take your guns out and shoot a warning shot into the air.  At this they'll either break into a run or surrender.  One interesting and innovative feature is that while driving you are able to shoot out of the window ahead of your car at the car you're chasing.  This usually leads to popping the tires, and then going for the gas tank.  Also, for in-car and on-foot fighting you can use bullet time to focus as the fighting is pretty fast and it's easy to get quickly shot to death.  One of the gimmicks of this game was that it was a fighting, shooting, and driving game.  I'd have to say the worst would be the fighting mode, since it's just too annoying during the story mode.  You could just pull out your guns and shoot the people, yet you are forced to fight them.  One of these instances is a very pointless fight in a hobo house with hobos that are harder to fight than your brother who knows kung-fu.  The driving is probbly the second worse, since it's so unrealistic.  I heard that the damage would be really realistic, yet when you hit a tree you don't even slow down.  It just fades away.  The shooting is really cool though, since you can go to a semi-first-person mode with bullettime, and aim at a person possibly just disabling them instead of killing them outright.  Well, the game would be at my house if it was cheap, but it really isn't.  This XBOX version lets you put in your songs, and it is actually cool to hear your music play at random during fights and driving.  Buy at your own risk, I take no responsibility.","summary":"What the...","unixReviewTime":1116460800,"vote":null,"style":{"Platform:":" Xbox"},"image":null}

I find; however, that it is not much like Ghost Recon at all.  GR requires tremendous patience, and success is largely based on equipping your team properly, and mostly positioning them in strategic locations.  With GR you can move almost anywhere you want, and attack targets from any angle.  In Ghost Recon you can control any player, but in RB63 you are stuck with Domingo Chavez.\nI find that RB63 is more of a shoot e'm up type.  Enemies appear seemingly out of nowhere, and you have to shoot quickly.  The choices of where to go in this game are much more limited, you pretty much just follow down the assembly line and shoot who pops up.  In Ghost Recon one enemy bullet can often kill you, but RB63 is more of a health meter type game.\nAs for the graphics, I was sorely disappointed.  Neither enemies nor your team look very real, and they all move with a skittish, too-fast shamble that looks really odd.  Play Ghost Recon, look through your rifle scope, and study the detail on your fellow soldiers.  You will see camo patterns, triggers, boot laces, CamelBak, etc.  Try that on RB63 and you will see a black, shifting mass with a play-doh face.\nI do like the huge weapon selection, and is something I wish Ghost Recon had more of.\nMy final summation.

About me and seven of my friends bought it at the midnight release and went to my buddies house where we played it all night and my friend and I beat the co-op storyline around 8 or 9 the next morning. There were some things I liked and hated about the game.\n\nStoryline: If you played the first one the storyline is lacking and really straightforward. You play the \"hero\", fight against aliens and save humanity\/earth whatever. For the second one when they released video clips it made it sound as if the aliens found earth and are attacking it and you (master chief) were turning earth into a crazy urban war between humans and aliens. Its been a long time since I played the storyline, actually the night of its release was the last time, but you only end up fighting on earth for the first one or two levels (I use the term lightly as halo has no \"real\" levels). Then you end up going into one of the alien ships or something like that. You also get to play as one of the aliens, which I found to be rather fun but also a \"played\" story gimmick as this has happened in other games as well. The ending was very dissapointing as it just left you hanging and wanting more and hoping there was actually more to the story left. Bungie could have done a better job and made the story more developed and the game a bit longer.\n\nGraphics: I've read a lot of reviews saying that the graphics are awesome but I didn't see a great deal of difference between halo and halo 2. However, I also didn't play either game with HD cables on an HDTV. They used the same engine and just added what seemed to me a polishing effect to the \"levels\" and characters.\n\nSound: I love the music to halo and I was happy to hear the music back in Halo 2. Also the human and alien voices are fun to hear. The multiplayer firefights and single player firefights are wonderfully done as it helps to make you feel like you're actually there in the game.\n\nWeapons: I was dissapointed in the weapon selection as there seemed to be no imagination to what they did with them. Humans have a sniper rifle so lets give aliens a sniper rifle. Humans have rocket launchers (the rocket launcher now targets and follows enemy vehicles-nice!) so aliens need a rocket launcher. The plasma rifle was given an unneeded change as it no longer froze your enemies in place to circle around them and hit them in the back, which made the rifle now another useless weapon in your arsenal. I enjoyed the sword in single player but in multiplayer was a very frustrating weapon to fight against. In single player the sword ran out of charge after so many hits but in multiplayer it lasted the whole game which was a very annoying thing. If you've ever played halo 2 multiplayer you know what I'm talking about. The pistol was toned way down but with few updates they gave it some power back but was nowhere near the \"horror\" like the first. Grenades were the most and saddest thing they changed in the game. I loved grenades in the first one and ended up using them more than anything in the game. So when I played halo 2 the first time I couldn't wait to throw my first grenade and when I did I literally freaked out. Master Chief \"dropped\" the grenade right in front of me and when the explosion happened I was still alive??? They turned Master Chief's powerful throwing into a \"toss\" or \"drop\" and the explosion of the grenade......well lets just say I might as well have been throwing waterballoons at the aliens with the damage that one of those did. The last thing they did was duel-wield which was a nice feature but the balance of duel-wield and other weapons was crap. The duel thing could've been left out and was a much over-hyped feature.\n\nVehicles: Like I said with imagination- Bungie seemed to be lacking in that department. Humans have a tank and a warthog so lets give the covenant a tank and warthog. I know, I know the covenant tank was in the first one but could you drive it?? Nope. I liked the fact that vehicles now could be blown up and that you could kick people out of the vehicle and take it or if you were crazy like me you could jump in a warthog with an opposing team driving it, thats always fun. I do wish they would have given you the option to turn vehicle damage on or off. In multiplayer you would destroy the warthog and a few minutes later they would have a brand new one waiting for them, so that was annoying too. The last thing they changed that I didn't like was I couldn't run over people anymore, well you can but its a 1 in 6 shot that you'll actually do it.\n\nPhysics Engine: I hate the physics in halo 2, one thing that made the original halo so fun was playing \"warthog basketball\" in blood gulch or blowing up a ghost over the middle of sidewinder and watching it fly.\n\nMultiplayer: Multiplayer is chaotic and can be fun but 70% of the time if you're not playing with a friend it is frustrating to hear people cussing you out, making really annoying background sounds etc. The addition of \"team chat\" only would've been really nice. Most of the upgrades they did to the multiplayer levels were nice and done really well, the name changes weren't really necessary though. I liked the setup for the xbl matching, I just wish that the players had more control over what levels, weapons, radar and such would go on during the game instead of the pre-made matches (that counted to your ranking) that you ended up playing over and over and over and over again. Also the hacking and modded xbox's that you would play sucked too, that was neither bungie's nor microsoft's fault, but did hinder the fun of the multiplayer experience.\n\nVision change: For the longes time I couldn't figure out why halo 2 seemed visually different than halo 1. One day, it hit me, I was playing multiplayer and was running around getting p'wned as I usually did in halo 2 and I realized the levels were closer to me than in the first one. I realized the developers went for a tunnel vision view instead of the periphial expanded look as in the previous one. In halo when I walked around, I had a periphial view and the levels looked so much larger and massive. In halo 2, however, they give you a more narrow view and make everything seem closer for a more \"unreal\" look, by unreal I mean like the unreal series.\n\nSingle player exploration: This is one of the things that made the original halo so awesome. My friends and I would spend countless hours in the single player mode going to areas we really weren't supposed to go and do things that were absolutely fun and crazy. You could actually get online and see things people would do and it made it all the more entertaining. In halo 2 they \"controlled\" the areas that you were not supposed to get to by putting skulls or I think in one level there was a huge ball or something. That made me lose the appeal to actually go and explore the level like I did in the first one. Now the developers want me to go find these \"hidden\" places that I wasn't supposed to......puh-lease!!\n\nSo to sum it all up, the cons seemed to outweigh the pros for me as an avid Halo 1 fan. The lack of vehicle and weapon imagination, physics engine change, tunnel vision with the short and dissapointing ending storyline made the rush of halo 2's release makes Halo 2 an average to below average first person shooter experience. Halo 2's multiplayer is fun with friends and the added detail in the levels makes it more tactical and visual treat. If you're looking for a game that has a good story and imagination this is NOT the game for you but if you just wanna play a fun shooter with some friends its not to bad of a game.\n\nIt only gets 2 stars from this dissapointed halo fan.....","summary":"Halo 2 left me puzzled....","unixReviewTime":1223424000,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

From the moment I picked it up it \"spoke\" to me like no other game ever has. And, I've been playing video games since pong. For 2+ years me and my friends would spend EVERY weekend playing online using XBC. Even with all that game play, it never got boring for us. Normaly, when I play a game and beat it, it then goes to the shelf to sit next to the rest of the games to collect dust. Even games that are fun to play online have never kept my attention for more than a couple of months.\n\nSo, when I tried out Halo 2, I was vastly dissapointed. I felt like I was playing another sega of the Unreal franchise. Master Chief has new low gravity jumps. Multiplayer now has gravity pads. You no longer take damage when falling from up high. Part of the strategy of Halo multiplayer was using objects to break your fall. The new weapons that I will talk about shortly make for a much faster game with a \"spray and pray\" feel to it. I thought I was buying Halo. Had I wanted Unreal, I would have just bought Unreal. Part of Halo's charm for me and many others was the fact that it wasn't Unreal or Quake. It was a skill based shooter that stood on it's own.\n\nI had a few problems with the campaign mode. It was very dark compared to Halo. I don't mean sinister, just dark. Not very many bright sunny days in Halo 2. It was rather short. And they did things with the plot that I could have done without. But, even with this said it was alright.\n\nThe major problem for me is the multiplayer. The multiplayer is where replayability is a huge factor. When my friends and I played Halo for 2+ years, we didn't sit around playing the campaign over and over. The main problem are the new weapons. They have removed or changed EVERY single weapon in the game. The weapon that made Halo what it was, the pistol, is no longer. This wouldn't have been all that bad, but no good substitute is offered. They said that they did this for \"balance\". But, when everyone has a pistol, there isn't a balance or overpowered issue. After all, you need some weapons more powerfull, or you might as well just only have one weapon for the whole game. Now they have a sub machine gun as the mainstay. It's a very weak weapon with a very short range. So instead of playing and shooting and having fun, I now have to chase people down to get into range. That, or wait around for a couple of minutes for a decent weapon to spawn. The plasma rifle no longer \"freezes\" an enemy. The physics of the rocket have changed and the splash damage has been reduced. The grenades have been toned down to being almost worthless. Even the sniper rifle is a little different. There are a couple of new mid ranged weapons, but at mid range you'll be lucky kill your target in a full clip. The new weapons worked fine in multiplayer, but don't translate for multiplayer. By making such a severe change in the weapons, they also made a fundemental change in the game play. It is no longer a mid ranged shooter, it is now a short ranged shooter. This is another reason it gives Halo 2 that Unreal and Quake feel. Halo 2 offers duel wielding where you can use a single hand weapon in both hands. This was a novel idea, and tried with other games before. The problem I have with it is that most of the weapons seemed toned down to force you to use duel wielding. You can't swing a dead cat around without hitting some ammo for a duel wieldable weapon. But any medium range weapons you'll be scrambling to find ammo.\n\nAnd there are a couple of new vehicles. They are fun, but my problems are in the changes to the vehicles we already had. Now you can board vehicles and they take damage. No more shooting a person out of a warthog as it drives by with your flag with your spawn weapon. Now you pretty much have to blow the whole thing up. GOOD LUCK! And well timed grenades no longer flip them over or stop them. Now you'll just do some damage to it instead as they drive by. And a persons shields are directly involved in when the vehicle is destroyed. You could shoot a rocket launcher at a Wraith tank and wait for the persons shield to recharge. Well, after 40 rocket launcher shots you would think it would be ready to explode, but no. Running someone over in a vehicle is much hard. I have hit people head on and simply bounce them off my vehicle about 100 feet without killing them. Boarding a vehicle is a novel idea, but a good player won't get into range of you.\n\nI could go on, and on, and on. All I have to say to end this is, try it before you buy it. They had 1.5 million pre-order sales on the first day. Not because Halo 2 was good, but because Halo was good. Those 1.5 million people hadn't even tried the game. I too was one of the unlucky. I fell for the hype and thought Bungie would make a quality game worthy of the name Halo.

Ranzoni","reviewText":"I've never considered myself a real-time strategist. Since Westwood's seminal *Dune II*, I've beaten about every major RTS on the American market. Yet game play hasn't evolved enough to sustain my interest.\n\n Same goes for turned-based strategy, though I've been clicking \"Next Turn\" since the original *Civilization*. These too, have stuck by the formula with insufficient innovations to maintain replay value.\n\n So when PC journalists began to herald an RTS\/TBS revolution last year, I took notice. Developer Big Huge Games and game `zines alike trumpeted a game to bridge the gap between the excitement and mechanics of real-time war games with the scope and sophistication of turned-based empire builders.\n\n Folks, I am still waiting. In the meantime, I received Big Huge Games' *Rise of Nations*; beneath all the hype it's a disappointingly conventional RTS.\n\n From the get-go, it's necessary to sort game from advertisement. Favorable reviewers all around have gushed some variation of the following:\n\n 1. *RoN* is a sophisticated RTS.\n\n 2. *RoN* is an epic RTS.\n\n 3. *RoN* is a hybrid between RTS and TBS game types.\n\n 4. *RoN* is a sophisticated, epic hybrid between RTS and TBS types.\n\n While I haven't tested these claims online, my single-player conquests invalidated these claims.\n\n *RoN* rigidly adheres to RTS tradition. Gameplay confines to the B3 principle: Build bases, Build units, Blow up. The developers include a Risk-style \"Conquer the World\" mode which offers raiding party actions, but otherwise missions are solved by building a base, amassing resources, and then smashing a computer-controlled base with a large, clumsy army. Like most modern RTS games, *RoN* offers rudimentary diplomacy, research, and economic features to upgrade your forces. Likewise, it offers a choice of combatants distinguished mainly by military power and texture skins variations. Finally, *RoN* arrays stereotypical unit types and superfluous gimmicks... like most RTS games, the player will quickly learn that building a bunch of tanks and rushing the enemy base works most of the time.\n\n *RoN* rushes with Blizzard-style play mechanics founded back with the original *Warcraft*. Players use a central building to generate labor units, units who mine a small range of archetypal resources from battlemap hotspots and typically hoof them back to the central building (though *RoN* mercifully permits players to build collection camps on-site). Players then spend these resources by ordering labor units to build factories, laboratories, and fortifications around the central building. Each has its own build queue for military units, and\/or unit upgrades as well.\n\n Bases are not sprawling, well-defend affairs as in the Westwood model. Fortifications lack sufficient range and hit points while costing too much to build; discouraging base-camping and encouraging aggressive play. One usually wins by destroying selected enemy buildings. A 200-unit population cap per player constrains their entire infrastructures.\n\n Frankly, I find this game-style dated. That doesn't stop Big Huge Games from trying to adorn their product with trappings of the turned-based empire genre. *RoN* notably introduces a \"library\" of additional building and unit upgrades. This library also improves caps and modifiers for resources, and improves the next notable introduction, national borders. National borders act strictly as a weapon, by inflicting \"attrition\" damage on any enemy unit or building caught on the wrong side of a shift. Per *Civilization*, a number of \"wonder\" buildings unlock special powers and modifications. And the players can advance through levels of technology called \"Ages\". BHG emulates Stainless Steel Studios in offering peaceful technology or resource races as an endgame option for skirmish and multiplayer modes.\n\n And that's it. Big Huge Games might call its combatants \"civilizations\", its labor units \"citizens\", and its bases \"cities\"; in practice it's still the Blizzard RTS military model. The intricate tech trees of the *Civ* and *MOO* series are here trimmed down to lines of yet more unit upgrades. Borders have no cultural or political purpose-they just act as a force shield. Economy is still a shallow matter of collecting resources and uncovering crates to build powerful armies. Missions are limited mostly to combat, the non-military options being woefully underdeveloped. Yes, *Rise of Nations* is straight RTS, no more sophisticated than *Starcraft* or epic than *Empire Earth*.\n\n With *RoN* put into perspective, I can see its virtues more clearly. It's a fast-paced entry into the \"historical\" genre, for those who want to upgrade armies from the stone age to modern times in an afternoon. A plethora of civilization-specific units and advantages lends a style choice to whichever side you play. BHG keeps base buildings to a minimum, and players can immediately build all units available for a given age, so long as they have the resources and the factories. Resources are widely available and players have plenty of room on each map to spread their bases and amass armies. BHG also incorporates good unit AI and path-finding. If the player doesn't want to worry about an extended campaign or story-line, *RoN* is all about skirmishes and multiplayer.\n\n Perhaps as much as the hype these traditions fail to please me. I'm tired of the arbitrary 200-unit population caps and mindless B3 routine. Westwood games may be even more dated in their play mechanics, but at least they concentrated each game on a story and well-executed themes, instead of developing a loose collection of skirmish variations beneath a thread-bare claim of being \"historical\".\n\n BHG could have broke the mold; the idea of a true epic RTS is one of the great unrealized ideas in PC gaming. They played it safe instead-but had the gall to call it something it is not. Make no mistake; dedicated RTS gamers will probably love this game for the same reasons I dislike it. But serious TBS gamers may be disappointed all around. *Rise of Nations* is no real-time *Civilization*; it's as conventional a military RTS as they come.

I figured the size and the Logitech name would guarantee a little longevity. I'm not especially rough on my toys, but my gaming area is rather cluttered with numerous projects, games, books, CDs, computer parts, etc. so wires, mice, game controllers have a tendancy to get tangled and like any lynch pin, move one and they all come crashing down.\nWhile the headset works, it's a little wonky in its functioning. It sounds just fine, but the microphone shaft is too short and ends up sitting on my cheek a half-inch shy of my mouth and doesn't pick up spoken word all that well. worse, it's kinda flimsy, the plastic too soft. It has a bulky volume control with mute button about a foot down the cord from the headset while at the other end is a small box with the Playstation logo on it. I suspect its a pre-amp or a signal changer, but it seems kind of obtrusive and gets in the way.\nIs it worth owning? Not at its current price- if it were ten bucks cheaper it would be worth it. It does what its supposed to do, but not very well. There must be a better substitute somewhere.\nJust great! The headphone & mic just fell of my desk and broke! A grand total of 1 meter.

While there has also been a great deal of negativity about this game, and moral condemnation, it has usually been from people who don't much actually play computer games and from many who did not take much time to see what this game is about or understand its context. That doesn't mean these people are entirely wrong, but it does mean they are mostly wrong, and, actually, one of the very clever things gta vice city does is actually lampoon the hypocrisy of its critics.  This, along with some excellent music, is done on the game's brilliant radio stations that play randomly in any of the cars you steal. I was a little surprised that the in game radio was perhaps my favorite thing from the game.\n\nAnyway, that's a pretty wordy preamble. You maybe just want to know what I thought of the game, so I won't go into an essay on morality in computer games.  I'll tell you what I thought.  I thought the game was all kind of a joke, which is fine, just, it was a mean joke.  Its meant to be played as a mean joke.  I didn't like that so much.  From here I'll just rank it according to some categories I devised reflecting issues important to me.\n\nStory:  C-  never very great in computer games, but, taking that into account it was pretty nicely done, ridiculous at times,  the free roaming thing integrated well with it, you sort of intersect with different lines of the story as you like,  still linear- don't know how you could have a story without that- but, like I said, it's all a bit of a mean joke and I got tired of it. I cant say how well it developed as I only managed to play about a quarter way through this game.\n\nCharacters:  C-  clever, very well voice acted, colorful types but completely lacking in any emotional connection whatsoever.\n\nGameplay:  C  here is where I really expected this game to be so great but was surprised it wasn't.  The variety of things to do was good, driving, shooting, very different kinds of missions, etc, but mainly I never much liked the shooting stuff. I thought it had a stiff jerkiness to it, found it unnatural and not as good as an average shooter.  The city was neat but I never felt like it was very satisfying, like, you could really only be a thug and that's it. I guess that's the point, you could do a lot within that, just, there wasn't any feeling of richness or depth, just breadth.\n\nGraphics: C-  again disappointing. I was expecting something terrific, but was surprised to find that, though the city was beautiful in its way, the character modeling was pretty unimpressive and seemed sort of out of date (even more so now). The stylish, cartoony characters of the box are not a fair representation of the more graceless figures in the game.\n\nDreariness factor:  D+  personally mugging people and shooting and vandalizing and stealing my way to power kind of brought me down.  It was nice to do it by the ocean though.\n\nTechnical issues:  did not have problems. That's just me.\n\nLearning factor:  C+  the game helps you along pretty well with a while-you-play sort of tutorial.  But quite a few things you're left on your own to figure out and controls for keyboard on certain missions (like an awful remote control helicopter) were very difficult to learn and handle.\n\nProduct materials:  D+  a good example of stylish but sort of useless.  Just tell me in detail about how things work and about controls and stuff.  All too often in pc games I get either almost no info or, like this, a bunch of setting the stage. Cute, but useless.\n\nChore factor:  F  see below\n\nDifficulty:  F  yes, I am all alone in this maybe, but most games are too hard! Difficulty levels are god's gift to a diverse population!  Especially useful difficulty levels.  This had none whatsoever.  Some things you do are easier, some are hard and, SINCE THERE ARE NO IN GAME SAVES, you (I) have to do them over and over, from the start.\n\nGame saves: F  no.  there are these save places you can go to or you can sort of lose a lot of stuff and just come out of the police station or hospital, but either way creates quite a bit of tediousness, often involving a bit of a drive just to get there.\n\nOther: if the concept of this game sort of leaves you cold but you're curious because its such  a well reviewed game I really say, don't bother.  If it sounds hilarious to be a rising young tough driving around `miami' in cars you stole I do sincerely recommend it.  It totally got the whole weird pulp fiction gangster movie amoral thing pretty well.","summary":"not as fun or amazing as i thought it might be","unixReviewTime":1108684800,"vote":"5","style":null,"image":null}

Games must be created with various difficulty level in mind. If they want to reach out to mass gamers, that is just what they need to do. People like myself aren't expert at games but enjoyed playing and completing it to experience something that could not be experienced in TV, movies or elsewhere.

My lovely lady advised otherwise and for once the crack of the whip was a good thing.  I rented the game and played about three hours into it before giving up all hope.  The graphics were beautiful, but that should go without saying -If you're going to delay a game for months upon months to tweak it, and then ask 50 bucks for it, it had better look nice and purdy.  So whoopty-hey on the gorgeous animations.  Software designers have no excuse for not raising the bar graphic-wise with all the computer technology they now have at their disposal.\nThe gameplay is linear and stagnant.  - \"Fight these three brown ninjas! Here comes a white ninja! - Fight this monster, oh wait, more ninjas!!\"  About the only rewarding feeling while playing the game was getting to run up walls and flip over people onto ledges etc.  But you can't have fun flipping around all day long because that damn \"random ninja generator\" is cranked to 11, and wave after wave of generic ninjas will keep attacking you as you play.  - So you can't enjoy the wall hopping without having to participate in Ninja Gaiden's stale fighting system. (Maybe they should have done a Ninja Olympics game??)\n**There is no ragdoll and the ninja's, when killed, die in about the same three or four poses.  This makes for very monotonous gameplay.  They attack the same way, and then they die the same way.  Zzz. (Ps - The camera\/view system is bearable at best. - Which is funny, because the game constantly emphasizes how a true ninja must be extremely observant and adept at looking around. - You'll spend a great deal of time wrestling with compromising camera angles.)**\n\nThe bosses, as I'm sure you've heard, are ridiculously hard.  But not in a fun advanced AI sense, where you feel the joy of battle... No, I'm afraid not at all.  The bosses are hard in the sense that they know what you are about to do before you do it, and constantly thwart your every attempt to attack them.  To defeat the bosses, you have to waste about 6 or 7 tries finding out what moves not to do, and what pattern it's okay to attack in.  To me, that's not a fun challenge.. that's more of a math equation done with an Xbox controller instead of a calculator.  Tecmo thinks it's funny to waste our time ;)\nTo end on a good note I must say that the story is solid.  And of course, the character artwork and animation is beautiful and fluid.  Very fun to watch.  (Sorry Tecmo, I just ran out of compliments.)\nIf you're a hardcore fan of the original games, hey, buy it. - You're bound to make it fun for yourself.  But if it was the hype train that brought you here, I would advise that you rent this one before buying it. - Metaphorically, this game is a shiny new Corvette with my craptacular 4 cylinder Ford engine powering it.

Sprague","reviewText":"Ever since Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance came out for the PS-2 it spawned many similar action\/rpg hybrid clones. For example there is the Champions of Norrath series and even Hunter the Reckoning. These games attempt to take the themes we enjoyed about Ever Quest, Baldur's Gate, and the world of darkness and make them into entertaining hack n slash co-op fests. In that regard Brother-Hood is more of the same. While it may wear a cheap Vault dweller uniform you can tell it is more \" loot n shoot\" than it is Fall Out 1-2 or Fall-out tactics.\n\nI understand why the Fall-out fans were peeved about Brother-Hood of steel. It was at a time Fall Out 3 had been promised many times only to let us down. Of course Bethesda FINALLY answered our prayers so bitterness and skepticism are things of the past.\n\nThe main thing you should know is this is NOT going to stand up to Fall-Out 3. Fall out 3 has a great series of plots. Brother Hood of steel doesn't. Fall out 3 has interesting non player characters to interact with in myriad ways. Brother-hood of Steel's NPCs are a cliche nasty bar tender, a prostitute, a cowardly mayor, and an old gnarled military vet missing an arm. Yup, I'd say Carbon has about 6 NPCs to talk to and that's it.\n\nHowever keep in mind Brother-hood of steel was not even trying to be Fall-Out 3 to begin with. It simply wanted to provide a fun 2-player destruction fest in a post apocalyptic world setting which is interesting. On that level it does succeed. Assuming you have a friend over it can pass the time. However I imagine playing it alone is a drab task of monotony.\n\nEach brother hood of steel initiate has different strengths and weaknesses. The girl is fast and agile, the tribal male is the proverbial slower power-house, and Kain the cool ghoul can actually walk through radiation without it harming him. When he upgrades certain attributes rads even heal him.\n\nI'd elaborate more but that's it. None of these characters have profound connections to their world. There is no stellar story line on the horizon. You accept a mission, kill raiders, ghouls, mutants, scorpions, rats, and death claws, upgrade equipment, and repeat that in tedium about 50 more times.\n\nWhile this game is supposed to follow the formula of a Fall-out Diablo a little innovation would have been nice. For example it would be better if some missions were personal to certain characters or that you could actually make pivotal choices instead of just being given the illusion of choices through giving those you talk to varied responses.\n\nI believe even 2-player action RPGs can have lovable protagonists and deep plots but apparently those in charge rather crank out the same dull uninspired engine over and over again.\n\nIf you have a friend over all the shooting and smashing is fun, then again the same can be said of almost any game using this same premise.\n\nIf you find this game in a bargain bin or for dirt cheap pick it up but if someone is asking for a high price laugh at them, extend your middle digit, and proceed to getting FallOut 3. (Aka how Fall-Out SHOULD be done!)\n\nPros\n\n+ A decent 2 player hack n slash fest.\n\nCons\n\n- Nothing to offer a single player and lack luster in almost every regard. Cussing, profanity, and kinky clad raider girls does not automatically make a game worthy of the name \"Fall-Out\".","summary":"Great for 2 players but bland in every other regard.","unixReviewTime":1228608000,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

I've noticed some good things and bad things. The campaign is as I said nothing special. Seems pathetic compared to ROC. They couldn't even work in the orcs, so they made them a \"bonus\" campaign, which involves you do some boring tasks, than ends. People say later you download more, but thats just a rumor. Anyways, the problem isn't building. There are 2 types of missions. Get a hero, fight to the exit, while rescuing units of yours who for some reason still have their weapons even when in jail. Theres also get a half built base, upgrade your townhall or tree or whatever, than attack. Most missions are so easy to complete with the starting units you are given. The real problem is the characters. There are no backgrounds to any character or development. Maiev wants revenge over some dead guards so she hunts illidan, that is her ENTIRE story. You never learn anything else about her, except she has some real problems with being nice. Kael hungers for magic, which is stupid. Arthas is boring, wants to get his power back, and help the king of liches. Pretty boring. Then theres the crypt lord, ana'narub. He says \"I was sent to aid you from the lich king\" and bam thats it. You never learn anything about him. He is so boring. Then once you finish campaigns there is NO ending, and you learn what happens to NONE of the characters except one. Yes you have to wait for a new game because there was no ending really. It never says \"Kael decided to eat, so he stopped being hungry\". It says nothing about any of those characters.\nBattle.net seems to be boring. Every game is usually a rush now. They downgraded most unit costs, and now it is incredibly easy to get mass units and attack. Out of the 100 or so ladder games I have played, only a few involved zero rushing. Tournaments are boring, match after match, people love chatting about nothing. Clan support has added the new constant spamming. Every public channel involves tons of newb clans talking about how they \"pwn\" everyone and are \"1337\" so we should all join.\nThe new units are boring. Spell breakers got old. Dragonhawks were in ROC just you couldn't build them, the AI could. Wyverns have had their name changed to Wind Riders for some odd reason. Batriders are fun, except noone goes them. I hate having to take down mountain giants, but they aren't too bad, same with those spirit walkers. Some units have been changed. Tanks are now engines and gyros are now flying machines. Boring.

I mean you can do things like blow off a cops head with a shotty, piss on people, urin on animals, set dogs and cats on fire and LITERALY throw a moltov at a marching band and have them go crazy, running about screaming for help while they're running around in fire...The game is indeed sick AND FUNNY.  Other then the games violence, another plus is the friggin humor, it's hilarious with some of the vulgar and funny stuff postal dude says.  The game takes place in a(not so huge)town where you can go around freeroaming and doing random things like going to the arcade or getting some milk in the convenient store.  Now of course that's not what you're suppose to do in the game...basicly everyday you come out of your trailer house and have abunch of errands to do(some which are very funny)and some(well acctually alot)of them will have funny misshaps causing chaos and violence.  Overall the game is pretty funny, the missions are somewhat pointless at times and the games violence makes GTA look like an E rated video game made by Disney. First of all I will get this out of the way, I had a really fun time with this game but overall it's not a game you should shell out 50 bucks(well I should have said that at the time I was playing the game cause it was indeed 50 bucks).  I for one did not spend the 50 dollars, I had it burned from a friend and now I'll get to it....\n\nFirst of all I loved some of the missions, especially the one with Garycoleman and a few others, they were some pretty funny stuff right there, and some were abit disturbing(like the one where you have to visit your fathers grave)but overall everymission was quite entertaining.  Visualy, the games average, no wows, not Greats nothing special JUST average.  The weapons are awesome especially the one with the cat silencer and the areas and places you visit were splinded to see at some points.  Now other then the funny missions and the game weapons, over the top violence the humor does get a LITTLE stale at some points and I will say this and I don't care for your flaming but THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY LOAD TIMES AND THEY TAKE FOREVER!!  There are some points where I could go downstairs and get a drink and come back up and the load time would still be there!  And alot of the missions become very very boring and repetitive.  The load Times are horrid, the humor does get very stale and the gameplay may get boring REAL fast to some(heck maybe many!)and the game is just TOO SHORT(If you ignore the friggin load times and the stupid A.I you will notice the game is ridiculously short and I beat this on Normal mode, not to mention the game takes place in a 5 day period\/scenario)..To some you will like it, to many you will hate it....and to others like myself you'll probably find it to be a below average FPS..But overall...I DID have a fun time with it..\n\nThe Good\n\n-The humor gets at times is pretty funny\n\n-Gary Coleman...nuff said\n\n-Some missions are really really really funny\n\n-You can use a cat as a silencer!!!\n\n-If you like a game with horrible acts of violence, and animal abuse you will love this game\n\nThe Bad\n\n-Gets Old REAL fast\n\n-Load times are just........horrible..\n\n-Some missions in my opiinon were just plain LAME\n\n-This game may offend ALOT of people\n\n-Some missions were abit frustraiting\n\n-Nothing els to really do other then mess around, after you beat the game\n\n-very short, just borrow it from someone you know, who owns the game\n\n-In my opion...just a below average game(only to be played for kicks and fun)\n\nWell I'm done with my complaining and ranting, the game is 20 bucks now and I still think it's not worth the cash, its short, not a very great game but the humor and jokes at times are hilarious but get stale later on...some of the games missions were just plain boring, only the violence, Gary Coleman and some of the missions kept the game entertaining for me at some points...but overall all I just didn't think the game was really that good...

Only when all nine planets are in perfect alignment is it possible for me to hate a Square-Enix game. For the game to come from the much-loved Final Fantasy franchise, there has to be a lunar and solar eclipse at the same time. Anyone's heard the story right? Square was a struggling developer back in the eighties facing bankrupty. They made a RPG styled after Dragon Quest, Japan's top-selling RPG, which turned into a mega-hit, saving the company and launching one of the most revered videogame series ever.\n\nIt's strange that I never played Final Fantasy when it first came out on NES. I know that my family owned the cartridge, but I'd never played it. I figured that the first game would be something special. Final Fantasy to me has always been the epic stories, the memorable characters, and the solid gameplay mechanics. Those were the qualities that just enthralled me when I became hooked on Final Fantasy II (the 4th one really) for the SNES. Unfortunately, the story is barely there and the characterization is nil. You are a band of heroes that is plopped down in a medival fantasy world and given the task of restoring the four crystals which will save the world. That's it. Most of the time you are wandering about aimlessly, trying to figure out where you are supposed to go. The method of exploration is go into cave, if monsters kill you in one hit, leave cave and find another. There are some towns you can visit and be treated to wonderful dialogue like \"Bless the Crystal!\" only thing half the idiots in this world say.\n\nIf that weren't frustrating enough, this is a really hard game. Unfortunately, the difficulty feels like it comes from poor game design than actually being meant to challenge you. Perpare to spend tons of time leveling up. You'll be attacked often, after one or two steps sometimes, the monsters appear in droves, and your attacks will miss as much as they hit. In dungeons, there are no save points for you to save and restore your health with a tent. The healing items and magic is woefully inadequate most of the time. The magic system is also messed up. Instead of having magic points to use as you please, Magic is divided into 8 levels and you can buy 3 spells from each level. You can only use magic from each level a certain number of time. This annoying because by the time you reach level ten most of the low level spells are practically obsolete but you'll have tons of them and few higher level spells. There are also no items to revive fallen party members, so you have to leave the dungeon, track back to town, and get a priest to revive you. This is really annoying when the town doesn't have a priest and you have to go halfway around the world to find one.\n\nI managed to play for 10 hours before I could stand no more. Final Fantasy II is a little better. You play as a group of youths fighting for a rebel resistance movement. The characters have personalities and the game actually gives you missions to accomplish. However, I didn't like the leveling system. Depending on how you fight, your stats increase and decrease accordingly. You'd think that would have the characters highly customizable? Wrong! The characters are still inclined towards certain jobs and weapon types. Maria has low HP and can't hit the broad side of a barn, so she has to be a mage. Give her a javeline instead of her bow and arrow and some animals will have gone extinct before she lands another hit. It takes forever to get the stats to increase.\n\nThe presentation of the games are pretty good. The graphics and spell effects are bright and attractive. The music is still exceptional. If you loved Final Fantasy I when it first came out and have been itching to play it again, ignore this review and buy this right away. These games have never looked better and they come will a host of unlockable extras. For everyone else looking to play the RPGs are yesteryear, get Final Fantasy Chronicles or Anthology, as Square has perfected the formula for RPGs by then.\n\nFinal Fantasy Origins is a relic of a long-ago era in gaming that has aged like Buddy Hackette. It's a definitely a historic benchmark for the industry, but for me it's only novelty is that it shows that \"You've come along way, Baby!\"","summary":"The games that launched an empire....","unixReviewTime":1100822400,"vote":"30","style":null,"image":null}

The camera is wonky and the controls aren't nearly as smooth as they were with the Dreamcast's controller.

As advertised, Sonic Adventure DX contains a slew of extras, like every Sonic game ever released on the Game Gear handheld, a brand-new Mission mode with 60 objectives, and Game Boy Advance connectivity options that let you raise Chao and unlock links for other GameCube Sonic games. Those are all cool features, but it's a different story when you get to the main portion of the game. The graphics have been polished with detailed textures, but the already problematic camera angles have gotten worse. The visuals also break up and have serious collision detection issues. These collision hiccups also adversely affect the controls, which otherwise feel good.\nThe audio has been spiced up with a Dolby Pro Logic II option, which sounds great albeit a tad too loud. The dialogue is the same as in the Dreamcast version and is not intended to be as goofy as it sounds, but it's certainly not irritating.

Each new Final Fantasy's story, world, and characters (give or take a Gilgamesh) were designed to be exclusive and limited to that game, which was made to stand as a complete work in itself. If people clamored for an elaboration on somebody's backstory or wanted to know what happened to Cecil or Terra after they saved the world, it was up to the fanfiction and doujinshi hacks to provide it. Square was too busy creating new worlds to continue dwelling in their old ones.\n\nOne of the reasons snobs like me (re: overeducated and underemployed) tend to be so violently dismissive of sequels in books and film is because they're just too easy. It takes a considerable amount of time and sweat to create, out of nothing, a fully-formed cast of characters, a world for them to inhabit, and the complete story of the crisis that will define their lives. Most people can't do it, or can't do it well. But it takes a whole lot less work to take an old story, wind up the crank, and get it moving again (which is incidentally why fanfiction and doujin have so many practitioners).\n\nEven though Square produced sequel after sequel, they were actually pretty bold in how they went about doing it. In addition to its steadfast refusal to listen to character-obsessive fans' demands for more of the same, Square earned international renown for reinventing what Final Fantasy was from game to game. Whereas rival developer Enix clung to a very specific formula in making its Dragon Quest games, SquareSoft liked taking risks. Final Fantasy II was a console RPG that completely nixed experience points and character levels (in 1987!). In designing Final Fantasy VI, Square brushed aside seven years of lighthearted medieval fantasy predecessors to present an apocalyptic steampunk saga with an aesthetic inspired by the European Renaissance and industrial revolution. VII ventured into cyberpunk territory during a time when RPGs were mostly rooted in basic swords n' sorcery settings, and carried with it something extremely rare in video games back then: overt social commentary. And Final Fantasy VIII -- well, regardless of how much anyone likes or dislikes VIII, it's practically a checklist of flaunted console RPG conventions.\n\nBut in 2001, SquareSoft took a risk and lost big. Enter Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, the failed experiment of a movie that cost SquareSoft $98,000,000. This is not a loss anyone can walk away from easily, even a powerhouse like Square.\n\nThe instant success of Kingdom Hearts in 2002 must have come as a relief, but Square was still hurting. It would still be a few years until a Kingdom Hearts II could start generating wealth, Final Fantasy XII was stuck in a developmental purgatory, and the corporate brass was still wrangling with Enix over merger details. Square needed a quick, easy way to make money. These were desperate times... and desperate times call for direct sequels.\n\nLike anyone crossing over to the dark side for the first time, I imagine the folks at Square must have been astounded at how incredibly easy it was putting together Final Fantasy X-2. The story was already 80% written, considering how there was no need to pay a brain trust of artists and writers to design an original fantasy world and its history from scratch. There was likewise no need to pump tens of millions into a budget towards programming and map design, since virtually all the areas from X could just be recycled and thrown into X-2 as they were. (In order to keep from looking completely cheap and lazy, they did design three attractive new areas, expanded a few old ones, and whipped up some simple textures for a handful of assorted unimportant \"branching paths and dead ends\" dungeons that could be assembled with your most basic level editor software.) The character models and animations? Recycled from X. Monster models and animations? Recycled from X. Battle effects animations? As many as possible recycled from X. Battle system? Well, rehashing X's might have been too obvious, so they went ahead and used a bootleg, watered-down version of Grandia's instead. And as for the practical considerations, they probably reckoned they could amp up sales amongst female gamers if all of X-2 featured all-female player characters, and they could do it without scaring off male consumers as long as Yuna and her friends showed a lot of skin. It's equally likely that Yuna's redesign was implemented with Lara Croft's enduring popularity in the overseas market in mind. And it probably wasn't until a bit later that they decided to additionally feature her in glamorous pop performance sequences that would lend themselves to television ads and soundtrack sales, and increase the game's overall marketability, since glitzy commercial pop was huge on both sides of the Pacific.\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 began development in early 2002 and was released in Japan in March of 2003. It has sold somewhere in the neighborhood of four million copies worldwide, and has 86% and 85% rankings on Game Rankings and Metacritic. IGN gives it a 9.5, calling it \"brilliant and addictive\" and praising Square for \"finally beginning to listen to the outcries of its fans\" and producing a direct sequel, while Gamespot calls X-2 \"every bit as poignant, endearing, and engrossing as its forebears.\" The now-defunct Official U.S. Playstation Magazine evidently gave it 10 out of 10 -- a perfect score.\n\nCritics. What do they know?\n\n~THE STORY~\n\nEvery opening to every Final Fantasy game more or less epitomizes the whole experience following it. Final Fantasy X-2, sadly, is no exception. The truest mark of Square Stockholm Syndrome is buying X-2, saying \"what in God's name was that?\" at the intro, and still deciding to go ahead and give the rest of the game a shot. Fans of Final Fantasy X might already be complaining that throwing a pop concert for a throng of adoring fans is tremendously out of character for X's vestal heroine -- but hold the phone! The Yuna we see onstage is actually her sneaky rival Leblanc, who has stolen her garment grid and is posing as Yuna to throw a sold-out pop concert and smear her image in the public eye.\n\n...\n\nAnyway, so after Rikku and Paine chase Leblanc around a while, our modest, clergy-raised priestess Yuna finally shows up to set the record straight and prove she hasn't sold out by backflipping onto the scene in a halter top and hot pants and unloading a few clips into her rivals' faces. Sass is exchanged, poses are struck, Yuna reclaims her garment grid, and she and her buddies victoriously return to their airship.\n\nNowadays, Yuna is running with the Al-Bhed side of her extended family. Calling themselves the Gullwings, they travel Spira's skies in Brother's souped-up flying eyesore and scour the world for spheres, the home movies of the ancients. See, at the end of Final Fantasy X International, Yuna discovers a sphere containing a video of someone who looks and sounds exactly like her vaporized boyfriend and wants to see if she can find more information about him. Secure in the belief that her beloved blonde beau still out there somewhere alive and whining, Final Fantasy X's heroine, dons her hot pants, halter top and combat boots, grabs a pair of pistols, and embarks on a quest for the truth with all the sass, charm, and you-go-girl power she can muster.\n\nSince Final Fantasy X-2 gives you the airship right from the get-go, the first chapter consists of tracking down new spheres and stopping by familiar locations from X to how Spira's changed over the last two years. The first sphere is in Besaid, where you can catch up with two of Yuna's old party members (gothic superbabe Lulu and her pudgy, sports coach bumpkin of a husband Wakka). Sphere number two is in Zanarkand, where you can watch Yuna and Rikku yell at Cid for turning the ruins (formerly the single most remote and sacred location on the planet) into a tourist attraction. If you care enough, you can also swing by Gagazet and visit Kimahri, who rules over the Ronso tribe by standing around with his arms crossed and making limp pronouncements in slow, broken English.\n\nEven though Final Fantasy X-2's main plot and characters are a bust, its subtext can actually be sort of interesting. The game's world is a familiar one, as it revisits Spira after the end of Sin, the fall of Yevon, and the rise of technology; but it was also designed with this world in mind. In spite of their best efforts, X-2's developers do show some cleverness in designing a fantasy world that appears more and more like our own the more we explore it.\n\nAt the end of Final Fantasy X, Spira managed to pull itself out of a thousand-year dark age by casting off religion and destroying the planet-ravaging monster Sin for good. Two years later, society is fragmented, leaderless, and entering the nascent stages of a rapid technological revolution that's already having unintended consequences. The people aren't quite sure what to do with themselves now that they're not constantly fleeing for their lives and rebuilding their destroyed villages every other week. The former Yevon faithful are struggling to find meaning in their lives now that their religion has been pretty much completely debunked -- and most of them are finding it in consumerism and hedonism. Also, the forests are dying, the ice is melting, and the music everyone listens to sucks.\n\n Does any of this sound maybe a little familiar to anyone? No?\n\n Perhaps I read too much into things.\n\n In any event, Final Fantasy X-2 would be a vastly improved experience if it were more like Final Fantasy I in conveying its story. Were all the character-driven melodrama slashed and burned, leaving the player to explore and figure out the game's world on their own, X-2 might not be so unrelentingly irritating. Unfortunately, since we do have to cope with the aforementioned character-driven melodrama, the weak plot, and the dozens of piddling subplots tied to the dozens of piddling sidequests in order to get a picture of what's going on in Spira, the disparate interesting bits are really just the sprig of parsley on a giant dollop of grease.\n\n~THE GAME~\n\"yah the story's not so good but the gameplay is pretty alright\"\n\nI've read a number of different reviews and articles concerning this game that all tend to contain some variation of the above sentence. Sure, X-2 might be the hot springs episode of the Final Fantasy series, but it also features a brand new iteration of the job system. As long as the character building and battle systems are about on par with the Final Fantasy V, which was great fun to play in spite of its lightweight story, doesn't X-2 deserve the same kind of credit?\n\nFirst, some words on the new battle and job systems. X-2 is back to using the old ATB system, but it also mixes in some elements from the Grandia games. Characters' and enemies relatives locations on the screen are more important than before: a character with a melee job will attack more quickly if her target is closer, and certain special attacks have a range of effect that additional targets can duck out of, provided they're far enough away from the main target. It sounds neat, but since there are so few of these attacks and there's no way to move characters aside from using the \"fight\" command, this mechanic rarely makes any significant difference in battle. Also borrowed from Grandia is the purple \"wait time\" bar, a new ATB gauge function. When a party member or enemy uses a special attack, there is a buffer period between when the ability is selected and its activation. This means that abilities are no longer instantaneous; they can be interrupted and delayed. But while Grandia's system is specially structured around this mechanic, X-2 seems to have just tacked it on mid-development, and it usually doesn't make much of a difference in anything. (For example, the Alchemist's charge time for her Stash command is tremendous, and she's still the game's most useful healbot. Likewise, the Warrior and Samurai's attack-delaying abilities are virtually useless.)\n\nAnd we have the new job system. Final Fantasy X-2 doesn't call them jobs, though -- I guess because that would be too unglamorous, too evocative of dirty fingernails. Instead, our teen girl squad equips \"dresspheres\", which change their clothes and thereby alter their special abilities. There's no mixing and matching abilities between outfits like in V or Tactics (barring the use of special accessories or garment grids), but X-2's spin on the job system is that it allows the girls to switch dresspheres in mid-battle, resulting in sparkly and glamorous Sailor Moon-esque transformation sequences (whose twenty-second lengths can thankfully be abridged or cut altogether through an option in the config menu). There are fourteen dresspheres in all, and X-2 does a commendable job of balancing them by setting their number of learnable abilities at fifteen (though there are a few loopholes).\n\nSounds great, right? But the truth is, this is all just the setup for another hilarious SquareEnix designer joke. The punchline is that Final Fantasy X-2 really wants you to participate in as few battles as possible. Whereas the earlier job-based game Final Fantasy V (heck, and Final Fantasy X for that matter) bombards players with a multitude of difficult and tricky fights, X-2 would rather we spend the bulk of our time watching cutscenes and playing minigames than doing those things that Final Fantasy X-2's exciting what's-it-called system was designed for. Unless you really go out of your way -- and X-2 rather expects you to, judging by the preponderance of minigames and sidequests -- you're not really going to be doing that much fighting (except when you're battling Leblanc's goofy henchmen, Logos and Ormi, over and over and over and over and over again during the first two chapters).\n\nMost of the time when you swoop over a location on the world map and accept a mission, someone approaches Yuna and drafts her into putting on a moogle suit and selling balloons to tourists. Or selling concert tickets to tourists hanging around the river. Or approaching NPCs and trying to guess the correct sales pitch that will compel them to go to one of the Calm Lands' two amusement park companies. Or chasing butterflies. Or chasing chocobos. Or chasing British people. If you're not selling something or chasing something, you're fighting sequential battles against clusters of human opponents that drop after two hits. (And sometimes, if you're lucky, you'll get to fight sequential battles against packs of the same three or four basic monsters in different configurations.) Then you watch a cutscene you might as well skip, get an item, and board the airship to search out more fun.\n\nAt least there's the Via Infinito, Chapter 5's huge optional dungeon: a hundred randomly-generated maps of unavoidable random battles and boss fights every twenty levels. The deeper you go, the harder it gets. Of course, in order to finish it, you'll need to grind your way up to around level 80 (at least). And you'll need to spend a bunch of extra hours stealing and bribing and getting enough amusement park points to stockpile all the items you'll need to see you through floors 80-100 and the last few superbosses. You know, you might as well just go ahead and finish the game so you can come back to the Via Infinito during New Game+. I couldn't bring myself to try, but I'm told it's totally worth all the time and trouble -- and it's required if you want to get the good ending.\n\nThere's also Sphere Break, X-2's incarnation of the collectible, number-based Triple Triad and Tetra Master card games from Final Fantasy VIII and IX. What are the rewards for playing and mastering Sphere Break? Well, beating Shinra -- the toughest player in the game -- is the only way to acquire the gambler job. Aside from that? Well, that depends on whether you consider the thrill of spending hours digging around in the desert for more game spheres and playing the same group of NPCs in the same location a reward in itself. You don't? Boy are you behind the times.\n\nOh, and blitzball is back. Did I mention that blitzball is back? It is.\n\nI don't even know what else to say here. I really can't think of a single reason beyond the Job System why anyone should ever play Final Fantasy X-2. It's surely the most incoherent Square game I've ever played -- the thing just can't decide what it wants to be. It wants to have a strong central plot, but is designed so that the bulk of the experience consists of optional little sidequests with optional little subplots. It wants the player to enjoy its exciting and well-designed (if not in need of a little polishing) battle system, but the game is built so that the player has to spend all his time participating in a variety of inane minigames instead. It wants to be lighthearted and somber, comedic and bittersweet all at once, and the designers just weren't capable of succeeding in that sort of balancing act -- especially considering how short a development cycle they were working with. (One year. The last Final Fantasy game that took only a year to develop was V, on the Super Famicom.) None of Square's work from the last decade or so has been very consistent, but Final Fantasy X-2 is something else. You'd almost suspect the corporate brass had it slapped together, crammed full of fanservice, and shipped out quickly as possible to help offset some huge financial deficit or something. At any rate, if you wanted to identify the Final Fantasy game that pinpoints, closely as possible, the period when Square finally and iredeemably \"sold out,\" X-2 would be it.\n\nAnd so I leave you with one final fun fact: Final Fantasy X-2's director, Motomu Toriyama, is also the director and scenario writer for Final Fantasy XIII. Hmm.","summary":"So It's Come to This...","unixReviewTime":1481673600,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

None of the strategic abilities really give you any advantages. You'd do fine just using the warrior dressphere with the attack command, as there's an insignificant number of enemies who resist physical attacks. Even the armored enemies from the first game go down easily to attack spam. Silence doesn't work on anything that casts magic, blind doesn't work on anything that uses physical attacks, and poison doesn't work on anything with high hit points. It's all useless fluff.

I picked it up after playing (and enjoying FFX) hoping to find a continuation of the innovative storyline, development and overall fun.  What I got was about as enjoyable as a knee to the groin.  At times I was tempted to break the game in half simply to assure that I would never accidentally put it in and play this beast again.\n\nAnger and spite aside, on with the review.\n\nThis game continues the FFX story just about where you ended.  It is 2  years later and the land of Spira has turned into one giant theme park where everyone and their mother is a tourist.  Two factions, governed by what looks like 13 year olds, have taken control of the population and are about to come to blows.\n\nThe game starts out at a concert where Yuna is performing a song and dance number, which is where I begin to taste a bit of bile.  It seems that Yuna has given up on her priestly ways completely, lost about 10 years of maturity, and started a life as a scavenger\/pop star.  Throughout the game you are forced to deal with her singing and dancing and a poor attempt to build a plot around it.\n\nOther co-stars from the first installment are back as well.  Lulu, Wakka and Kimhari make their cameo appearances but contribute nothing to the story.  Rikku comes back as a playable character, but she seems to have de-evolved into a prepubescent child as well.\n\nI won't go into the storyline at all, simply because it would hard to say anything about it without giving the entire premise away completely.  Let me just say it is shallow, very shallow, and completely not worth investing the time to see the endings.  Just look them up on Youtube and that would be good enough.\n\nGame mechanics were severely underdone in my opinion.  After the success of FFX, square could have simply ported the game over, changed the names around, and made yet another success out of it.  This game consists of all of the bad parts ported over, and new dumbed down material.  The awkward conversation scripts, irritating voices, and giant plot holes are all back again.  Sadly, all of the good things are gone.  Gone is the sphere grid leveling system, the multiple character with some nice storyline, even a good underlying story is too much to ask of this game.\n\nThe combat system is nice, I have to give it that.  You are given three characters for the entire game, but you have the ability to change their profession in mid-combat.  Sadly, because every battle is fast paced and all of your skills, magic and even items require a large amount of time to use, you will fight most of your battles by holding the button down and attacking madly until something dies.\n\nAll of the visuals, monsters, characters and settings are a straight port from the previous release which I found odd since this game is far shorter.  I got through it with about 60% completion in under 20 hours.  While spending more time to get 100% will get you another 1.5 minutes of ending sequence, it is really not worth your time.\n\nIn all, looks as good as the original.  While I liked the fast paced, quick thinking fight system, the omission of an interesting leveling system was irritating.  This game was a slap to the face of the fan base it was supposed to be made for.  At many points, the shear shallowness of the dialog, lack of character development and simpleminded mini-games make you feel like you are playing a game more suited for 11 year olds.  Then you get a thong shot of Rikku or you hit the point you have to give  a sensual massage to a woman for points and you wonder what the heck the creators were thinking.\n\nIf you are a fan of Final Fantasy gaming, avoid this one.  If you are not a fan, well, you have no reason to touch this one anyway.","summary":"Charlie's Angels meets Barbie's Beach Party","unixReviewTime":1204243200,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Imagine an annoying stereotype of a dumb, shallow woman who spends most of her time jumping up and down giggling and talking about make up.  That is how the three main characters are portrayed.  If you like Yuna or Rikku in FFX, you're likely to be very irritated by what Square turned them into.  This cheesiness permeates every aspect of the game.  In order to change job class, you change their \"dresses,\" and the characters strip and put on a new dress every time you change their job class.  A mini-game even entails one girl giving another a massage and you have to press the right buttons to massage her well.  And let's not forget the scene where they all splash about in the water in their underwear, giggling.\n\nStory.  There isn't really one.  It's mostly the three characters going around the world map fighting unimpressive enemies and giggling.

You can actually change job classes in the middle of a battle, and characters improve their stats within each job class instead of overall.

The battles themselves are varied and complex, as are the various interesting abilities the characters can acquire.\n\nGraphics.  Awe-inspiring.

At least Ultima IX has a more interesting story and better quest system. I loved this game the first couple hours I played it, but after the first week my interest in the game started to diminish. In the begining I assumed it would get better later on, I assumed there would be new monsters I would face, I assumed after I explored my first dungeon that they all would look unique and be different, I was wrong.

For instance a slave, a vampire, an npc, and your own character all can look exactly the same if say they are all dark elfs. I was very dissapointed with the vampires in this game. I was expecting to see a monster with pale skin, wearing a black cape, has fangs, and floats across the floor. Instead vampires look just like any other NPC or character of that race.  I was also disapointed with the bosses in this game. In Diablo II and Baldurs Gate bosses had a unique look and actually looked fearsome, not so  All the dugneons and caves in this game look like they were just cut & pasted. In Baldurs gate and Diablo II each dungeon looked different and had a unique theme with mosnters unique to that dungeon, not so in morrowind. After you have been in one dungeon you have been in all of them. I also was expecting the dungeons to have a more creepier look and really did not care for the U.S. Steel look.\nOh and the missions, well they were really fun at first, but after a while you relize they are the same fed-ex type missions. Go kill so and so and report back to me, go steal\/buy something and report back to me, please escort John Doe somewhere and report back to me. I was expecting a more origional quest system implemented than simply the Everquest Fed-Ex system.  After a while all this runing back and forth gets very annoying, tiring, and old.","summary":"One of the most overated games of all time!","unixReviewTime":1079654400,"vote":"6","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Raillard","reviewText":"This game is fun for about a day or two, or for a party with friends.  It is infuriating if you actually keep at it and try to get better and use strategy.  Because of the emphasis on offense (as in NBA Street), there is precious little strategy needed to win.  Defense is a lost art and a source of utter frustration; for example you may block a shot, yet it still goes in, yet when the CPU blocks, the ball falls towards them half the time.  The moves are cool, the unlockables are neat, yet ultimately it is a shallow game.  The whole emphasis on consumer goods (buy a nice house, car, posse, etc) is a nice idea that is poorly implemented.  Ultimately, the games are all as follows: 1)dribble towards your opponent 2)Perform the \"Act a Fool\" moves 3)dribble by opponent 4)Shoot 5)Get back on \"defense\" and watch your opponent score on you, no matter what you do.  Also, the utter lack of reliability in terms of the shooting is aggravating; there is no rhyme or reason to your jumpshots.  You may hit them with someone in your face, yet you may miss 4 in a row while wide open.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game, it's just that those looking for a little depth may want to look elsewhere (like ESPN NBA 2K4, which has a street mode not unlike this game).  The graphics are okay (both ESPN NBA 2K4 and NBA Live 2004 are better) and the sounds is good, but the loading times are TERRIBLE.  Seems like half the game is spent waiting to load.

{"overall":2,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"05 6, 2005","reviewerID":"A2U6NDRIC7KWQR","asin":"B00008Z0HX","reviewerName":"Warlock One","reviewText":"Here's the basic run-down:  What you have here is a first-person shooter, made with the Unreal engine.  It was based on a Belgian comic book, and imitating the style of said book, it uses a nifty graphic effect called \"cel-shading\" which makes the polygonal characters look less like the realistic figures many games aim for and more like cartoon or comic-book characters.  Game play is divided between straightforward action sequences and goal-based sequences, usually involving stealth.\n\nSo far so good. But...\n\nAs a gamer, I always take things with a grain of salt when a reviewer says a game is too hard.  For many gamers, the response that comes to mind is invariably \"Maybe it was too hard for YOU...\"  But listen.  I can play through most games on their \"regular\" difficulty setting, and this one I gave up on, largely because of the aforementioned \"stealth\" sections.\n\nThere are stealth games, and games with stealth segments, that I enjoyed.  Metal Gear Solid and Deus Ex both come to mind. But a stealth game really ought to have some, if not all, of the following features: 1) Being spotted by an enemy makes things difficult, but does not automatically kill the player.  2) Stealth gameplay should allow players a great deal of flexibility in routes to take and tactics to use; it should never be \"read the designers' minds or die.\"  3) Stealth games should have a system for saving your game that doesn't mean you have to sneak past the same four guards over and over again because you keep getting spotted by the fifth.\n\nGuess what game fails on all three counts?\n\n*ding* *ding* *ding*!  That's right, unlucky number XIII.  Many of the stealth sections are _exactly_ matters of memorizing the guards positions (after innumerable failures), then timing your movements with theirs, or failing.  Want to kill one of those obnoxious, alarm- raising guards?  Oops!  Pity the patrol path of another guard (who you never saw) takes him within line of sight of the body.  You can move bodies, IF you're using a weapon that leaves one or both hands free, a fact the manual fails to mention.  The main character also has a kind of \"sixth sense\" which allows him to see visible, comic-like \"tap tap taps\" on screen when an unseen enemy is walking nearby, but it's only intermitently useful.  Expect to still be blindsided with annoying frequency.\n\nCompounding all this frustration is a save-game system that is dead lousy, even for a console port.  Expect to be able to save at the beginning of a level, and that's it.  If you're lucky, the designers may have deigned to give a checkpoint or two, frequently at points that make little sense (not immediately before a \"boss battle\", but three bad guys before it?)  The combination of these two points is unforgivable.  I gave up on this game on a stealth-based submarine level featuring guards walking overhead on catwalks.  These catwalks made guards who could see me nearly impossible to spot myself and literally impossible to kill before they triggered an alarm.  Thanks, guys, I love games that make my small advances in progress meaningless in such an arbitrary fashion.\n\nIrritating but less game-killing annoyances:  The game's characters lip-sync their speech in a fashion barely better than the old Speed Racer cartoons.  For a game with such fluid animation otherwise, and given any number of recent games with very good in-engine character lipsync, this is incomprehensible.  Lead actor David Duchovny's inflection seems utterly uninterested in the intrigues around him (phoned in another paycheck, eh, Dave?)  And for a game that clearly prides itself on its storyline, there are weaknesses in pacing and moments that completely jar one's suspension of disbelief.  A \"rescue mission\" level ends if a guard trips an alarm while you're outside the prison, but this condition vanishes when you enter the prison itself.  (There's no alarms IN the prison?)  Some levels link one into another in a frustratingly endless fashion; other times, after a single level it's time for a cutscene, restored health, and a new weapons loadout.  The latter is both bewildering and annoying: Why does the protaganist, knowing he's heading into the lion's den, choose to leave some of his most powerful weapons behind?... Because he knows what kind of ammo the bad guys are going to be dropping when he kills them, I guess... The five missiles and the launcher you had at the end of one level are arbitrarily taken away from you, and then you discover you really _should_ have been conserving crossbow bolts during an unnanounced six-level stretch.  A side effect of the process is never knowing whether you should be conserving ammunition or not.  Don't expect the ammunition you need to be conveniently there when you need it; you'll find a ridiculous overabundance of ammunition in some places (throwing knives in the first aid station?  Of course!  Why not?...)  and a fatal dearth of same when you really do need it, like the aforementioned sub stealth mission.\n\nTwo last quibbles:  Despite doing a \"full install\", my version demands each of the four CDs be inserted sequentially as you progress through the game.  I also get barraged with unskippable logo sequences for Ubisoft, Nvidia, and Alienware EVERY SINGLE TIME I play.  (Ironic given I've been playing on a Radeon-equipped E-machine.)\n\nTo be fair: the graphics are frequently beautiful, the plot probably makes a pretty good graphic novel (if not the best game), the use of a grappling hook is interesting (though not unique), the ability to pick up some ordinary objects to use as blunt weapons is a nice touch, and the musical score isn't half bad.  Still, there are many better games on which to spend your time, even in the bargain bin, including first-person shooters.

The idea here was also to add comic-book stylings:  certain game elements appear in break-away and pop-up panels seperate to the main action, and sound effects get their own animation (like the \"Bam!\" of a gun or the \"Tok!\" of footsteps).\nFrom here the problems are many.  The savegame system mimics consoles:  you must make it to the next checkpoint to save, and at least one level had *no* checkpoint throughout the entire first part.  The gameplay is inconsistent:  sometimes I can take down an opponent with one shotgun blast to the midsection, other times it takes a half-dozen head shots.  There are times when a sequence starts you off surrounded by bad guys, and you end up standing there facing them, both of you plugging away at each other--no chance to duck behind cover or take them out strategically.  Sometimes the comic-panel animations appear *under* my screen - I can see the edges of the animation poke up at the top.  Sometimes the game locks up my hefty system.  And every time I start the game, Disc 1 isn't good enough:  it asks me to \"please insert a XIII disc\" until I give it Disc 2, 3, or 4.\nI would pay [less] for this game just to try it multiplayer, but at [the price] I was very disappointed.

You wanna play a Jedi... this should be called, Star Wars: KOTOR Online.  The Jedi Population is out of control and it was SOE's biggest mistake to allow players to become Jedi's...  They should have left that as a rarity in the game, only had a few NPC Jedi's like Luke Skywalker in the game, as novelties for offering special Quests...\n\nBut no... they wanted to let players be Jedi's as a selling point.\n\nHow many Jedi did you see charging across the Hoth Battle Field with Luke, to take down the Imperial Walkers?\n\nIn Star Wars: Galaxies... there will be several hundred of them out there on Hoth... if SOE and LucasArts ever gets around to adding Hoth.\n\nThey're too busy adding Episode II and III content like the planets Kashyyyk and Mustafar... speaking of which, if you're a Jedi then you can go to Mustafar and help save Obi Wan Kenobi's ghost; whose \"lost his way\" ... how lame is that?\n\nNow, they can't remove the Jedi from the game like they should.. because they hyped up being Jedi so much that \"everyone and their mother\" has one, or has played one... and would cry, bitch and comlain if SOE removed them.\n\nSOE is \"claiming\" all these changes are making the game feel more \"Star Wars\" like... however within the last two weeks they have destroyed the in-game player economy, destroyed the orininal 30 Player Professions and redesigned 9 new ones... removed the ability to play a Hybrid Profession.. and turned the game into a massive online FPS that seems like it is based off of the KOTOR Timeline, instead of the Timeline it is supposed to be based off of... and ruined the combat system.\n\nDo not buy this game.\n\nIf you want to play a Star Wars game, go play one of the Console Games like Star Wars: KOTOR series... or the new BattleFront series.\n\nAt present, this is probably one of the worst Star Wars Games ever made now.\n\nIt is all thanks to mismanagement and bad design ideas at SOE and  LucasArts... who both seem to think they can use this game to completely rewrite all of Star Wars history.\n\nMaybe, someday in the future they'll get smart and fix this game... but for now...

Unfortunately, as a video game it's more a test of memory than a game of challenge and skill. The more times you go through the maze the quicker you get. You can drive mostly any vehicle that comes along but it's best to stick with the assorted lots offered in the menu. I wanted badly to like this game since I love the Simpsons and got this game for the kids. They stopped playing it after running into so many false level-endings. That's where I took over fresh from playing \"Need for Speed: Underground\". You become various characters driving around Springfield to find clues to a mystery regarding black vans and crop circles. The automatic camera controls are by far the worst. It jumps erratically from chase view to overhead view if you get stuck in a tight corner or running on foot. This greatly interferes with game play. The physic's gravity is terrible. I had my car hanging on the pier edge forever unable to decide whether to fall or not. The graphics is 3-D cartoon. At times, I find myself manually circling the camera several times to see where items are positioned and where the ledges are \"really\" located to jump on. The vehicle jump cam is also a big problem. It's set to \"On\" by default but can be turned \"Off\" in Options. It's no good if I can't see where you're going to land after doing a ramp jump. The task themselves are simple but after getting to a certain location or collecting such and such an items under a time limit, the player is then immediately tasked to go to another location before time runs out to start yet another part of the level.  There can be 2-4 parts to these levels and failure at anytime along the way results in the player starting the level all over. There is no way for anybody other than the programmers themselves to get through all the levels the first time. The game is unforgiving making a wrong turn or get stuck by a car will mean doing the level over. There's no room for error. When tasked to go to a location, you have to rely heavily on the overlay map and green arrows on the road to know where to go while dodging pedestrians and vehicles that to me seem to have a death wish to jump into the path of your vehicle. Hitting the items gains you coins. Another problem is that some items you can crash through and some items are solid like the Rock of Gibraltar. There's no way to tell the difference without trial and error. If too many items are hit in a certain amount of time then the police comes in hot pursuit of you. If you're caught; you pay a 50 coin fine. Finally, the game cheats the player by running over your character trying to get to your vehicle, placing your vehicle way down the street or  stopping the game with time still left on the clock. I'm sure that the creators licensed the game to the video game developers and may have even wrote a basic story plot but as the video game part it's totally weak. By changing the XBOX's clock to holiday dates like Christmas, Springfield will change it's appearance to match the holiday moods. This is true of Halloween, Thanksgiving, etc. It's good enough just to drive around Springfield and forget the missions.","summary":"Beautiful Recreation of the Simpsons but terrible game play","unixReviewTime":1117238400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

The only diffrence is the time they take place with a few notable changes. It kind of kills the fun by level 4. There are collector cards but the rewards for them almost feel unworth it.

First of all I would like to know why the hell your not Gabe Logan in this game!?!?!  Sure you can create your own agent but it doesnt feel like a Syphon Filter game without good old Gabe!  Now he went from being a professional agent to doing paper work.  Well atleast you get to work for him or so you think.  Through the whole game your taking orders from this annoying women(that I cant remember her name) who is always  freaken  yelling and being a smart ass every time you make a mistake. They could of atleast had Gabe tell you what to do because I would respect his opinion at least. Second of all this game is freaken hard.  Your enemies take like 15 shots each even at point blank range and your freaken map is impossible to freaken read.  And your enemies continue to come back to life. You kill all the enemies then you leave then you go back there and all of them are alive shooting you again. I also didn't know what the hell was going on half the time.  All the sudden it would say \"OBJECTIVE FAILED\" and im like \"what objective?\".  Plus in order to beat the game 100% you have to play online.  WHAT THE F***!!!! Since when has anyone made a game were you have to be online to beat it 100%.  I did like a couple things about the game.  It had pretty good graphics and the sound effects were also very realistic.

In the game, the player takes the role of Jet Li - or rather, a character virtually portrayed by him.\n\nThe story is a fairly simple, revolving around Chinese gangs and criminal elements. Jet Li - or the player - is Kit Yun, a bodyguard responsible for protecting Boss Chiang, who is attempting to leave his life of crime behind. Most of the story involves beating up other gang members who are trying to kill Chiang or, later, his daughter, and the story serves mostly as an excuse for this violence.\n\nThe gameplay is simple compared to many other brawler games: aside from guarding and area-specific actions, fighting occurs by pushing (\"slapping\", in the game's words) the right control stick in the direction that you want to attack. This allows for multidirectional attacking in the game's many multi-opponent fights. This simplifies combat almost to the point where it's not fun anymore; the only other action is \"adrenaline attacks\", which is basically slow motion or bullet time. Gun battles work roughly the same way, except the control stick is used to target and the R2 button is used to shoot. Apart from some neat interactive features, like kicking people into equipment or onto hot stoves, there isn't a lot of gameplay variety.\n\nThe graphics are decent, but not good. Faces are reasonably good, but also tend to be blocky. The textures range from mediocre to poor, with too much blur and not enough detail. The action, despite some neat slow-motion moments, is generally lackluster as well. The sound is for the most part forgettable and consists mainly of yelling in Chinese.\n\n\"Mediocre\" describes this game fairly well. At most parts, it simply drags as you are forced to fight yet another wave of hooded thugs, and it lacks excitement and panache.\n\n4\/10.","summary":"Lacks Excitement","unixReviewTime":1199318400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Mok","reviewText":"Any enjoyment you might derive from this game is from playing as Jet Li in an old-school fight setting.  When the novelty of that wears off, what you have left is an incredibly repetitive game with a godawful camera and an ill-advised control scheme.\n\nYes, bonus marks are in order for using Cantonese in Hong Kong with subtitles.  (As a native Hong Kong person I can say the dialogue is less stilted than usual, though still flawed)  Though I might add that international espionage games like Syphon Filter has been doing that for years.  The settings are authentic enough, with the battles in the Hong Kong settings being especially evocative of kung fu films.\n\nBut is it worth the very problematic gameplay?  Just barely.  If you've seen\/played the demo already, you'll know that the entire fight system consists of slapping the right analog stick.  While the array of moves you can unleash is impressive, motion-captured well from Li's own silhouette, this system is very ill conceived from a fighting-game perspective.  Worse still, the camera is so restless that you could be in the middle of a combo against an enemy, and then the perspective shifts so that you're suddenly hitting at air and the enemy's to the side.  So many game designers have misled notions about being filmmakers, not realizing that the best perspective for gaming is a fixed perspective.  This problem came to a head during the ludicrous \"escape from capture\" stage where the camera actually cuts you off, preventing you from seeing what's behind you, even though there are guards sweeping flashlights that way that you're supposed to avoid!  This is simply a moronic use of the camera.\n\nAside from this, the fighting gets tired awfully quickly, especially since the designers committed the ol' \"this level never ends\" sin.  This game alleviates this problem by having lots of checkpoints where you can continue the game, but during some of the \"one against 14\" stages, the endless brawling still gets tired.  And whose idea was it to have enemies pull off 18-hit combos, where if you get hit the first time, you get to watch your character get pummelled for 10 seconds straight?\n\nI actually find the gunfight segments of this game more fun than the endless, endless hand-to-hand stages.  This is where the dual analog sticks truly shine, allowing you to smoothly run from spot to spot forwards and backwards while your hands can aim independently and a top button allows you to do Time Crisis-style ducking.  There's even a crazy level where you fight off about 100 enemies with two nailguns!\n\nThis game would probably remain tempting to Jet Li fans because of the role-playing aspect of it.  And I wouldn't blame them -- this was my reason for buying this game, and there are a few levels that I truly enjoyed.  The overall game, however, is really not that great, and I would recommend only playing it in small doses.  It will get tired mightily quickly if you sit with it for more than an hour.","summary":"Poor gameplay, but does capture Jet Li's moves well.","unixReviewTime":1085270400,"vote":"14","style":null,"image":null}

But its unforgiveable flaws turn what could be something of a classic into an ulcer-inducing experience.\n\nLet's re-cap:\n\n1). The load-up time is just criminal! It takes--what--five minutes or so (I'm being nice) between the time that the CD first starts to load and when the player finally connects to the on-line system. Life is too short. This is atrocious. Check out games like \"Amplitude\", \"Tribes\" or Hell, even \"Socom 1\" and the load-up\/log-in time is never more than a minute.\n\n2). \"Network Cable is Disconnected\". An error message that for no reason pops up once, twice even three times during the boot-up\/log-in process (worse now with the recent patch). Not that the network cable really is disconnected, by the way. And once the error message appears the only resort is to re-boot the game. Takes the player all the way to the title screen. Start the clock and watch another five minutes of loading drip by. This problem happens routinely to most players.\n\n3). The scoring system. Zipper has refused to comment on the exact algorithm that they use for their zany scoring system. Don't try to figure it out. Win a round--your rank may go up or down...lose a round--your rank may go up or down. Who knows? The on-line joke is that even Zipper has lost control over it. Most players have long since abandoned trying to make sense of it. Even with the new patch the logic of the scoring system remains a mystery.\n\n4). Unpredictable on-line gameplay. When the disclaimer pops up and reveals that \"Online experience may change during gameplay\", they ain't-a kidding! Lag-issues aside, whole servers sometimes crash for no reason, microphones work...then they don't and players are bounced from a game all the way back to the load up screen--you now get rewarded with another five minutes wait before you can get back in the game (unless you get the \"Network Cable...\" error again--!).\n\n5). The Patch. What kind of PS2 game has to require you to download patches to fix the bugs?

That's a half-compliment. Glitchers (different from cheaters) will find new ways to exploit the game...and will eventually bring it down.\n\nSocom 1 had none of these problems. That game was destroyed by cheaters. Socom 2 smells suspicously of a game that was rushed out for Christmas at the expense of proper beta-testing. If Zipper could go back to the first game's program code and yet keep out the cheaters...well, then they will have a game worthy of five stars.\n\nOr maybe someone else will come along and blow this game out of the water.","summary":"Nice Idea...But Zipper's Bugs Destroy Any Online Quality","unixReviewTime":1095465600,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

And it's not the first time i've ever played a game where the developers disabled the right thumb stick, (ninja gaiden black, metro prime), thereby not allowing me to control the camera so that I could adequately play the game. The other platform game, (Sly Cooper), allowed me to move the right thumb stick \"UP AND DOWN\" so that I can effectively make jumps.  Jak 2 however, doesn't allow me to move the camera up and down, and this resulted in me making a lot of \"BLIND JUMPS\" which sent me back to the beginning of EVERY mission.

I have played and beaten the prequel thoroughly, even getting the extra ending for finding all the Precursor Orbs. I loved the game from one end to the other.\n\nWhen Jak 2 opens, it's clear that the story will be taking a new turn into a dark place:  our heroes are in a bad future, and we take control of Jak only after an interval (told through cutscenes) of his having been tortured and mutated.  It seemed to make for an interesting new take on the series, but very quickly you realize that unlike its predecessor, Jak II imitates more than it innovates.  Even worse, the imitation isn't even in the same genre:  Jak 2 dovetails its platformer formula into a more \"sandboxed\" open world that heavily mimics the Grand Theft Auto series.  I've played the GTA series and loved it, but here the fusion fails miserably.  As the storyline progresses, frustrating side quests and attempts to inject variety into the gameplay are quickly derailed by the fact that a single mistake blows the entire operation, bumping into someone during a race can trigger a full alert, and you can easily get shot out of the sky, have your vehicle explode out from under you, or find yourself surrounded by a never-ending stream of guards.\n\nI'd like to say the awfulness ends there, but unfortunately the amount of effort quickly outweighs the payoff.  There are times when \"puzzles\" amount to \"how often can you kill\/smash things before you're caught and killed?\"  In more than one sequence, you become convinced that Jack Thompson has finally found his \"murder simulator\":  the goal is to bang on the trigger, again and again, as fast as you can, while guards die screaming at your feet.  The difficulty is balanced by a bonus \"Dark Jak\" feature that makes you super-powerful. However this feature gets seriously annoying: it takes a lot of dark eco collecting to charge it up, and during these murder-fest stretches, it's all too easy to accidentally bang the lower trigger and blow your charge.  If you plan to use this power burst to get yourself through a difficult spot, if you don't survive to the checkpoint, you won't have it available to you again because there won't be enough Dark Eco lying around to recharge you.\n\nWhere I finally gave up on this game--at the 94% mark--was when the number of pointless conveyor belts with hard-to-reach switches over boiling lava and\/or radiation pits made me realize that this was no longer \"challenging\", it was more like a test to see how angry the player could get before they take the disc out and throw it against the wall.  I have beaten many a game and put up with many, many death sequences, and in the end Jak killed my desire to go on far deader than any of the bodies I'd stacked along the way.

I was looking forward to another cool action\/platforming adventure. But that was NOT what I got.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the lighthearted, madcap-cartoon tone of the first game is lost. Instead, characters are constantly angry, scowling, and generally put you in a bad mood. I hated Jak's new personality. I would rather him be a \"mute\" than this \"angry young man\" type.\n\nIn the first game, once you entered an environment, you could wander freely, grabbing Power Cells in any order that you wanted to. Not so in Jak II. Instead, you are given \"missions\". Now, mission-based gameplay is a pet peeve of mine, since I'm used to games where you figure out your objective on your own, so it may not bother people who are used to this type of thing. It does, however, make ME angry.\n\nIf the missions themselves were good, this wouldn't matter, but they're not. They're lame and repetitive to a fault. Shoot this...shoot that...beat this time...what happened to the creative objectives of the first Jak and Daxter?\n\nThe most grevious issue to me, however, is the controls. In the previous game, the simple platforming and combat let me concentrate freely on my goals. Here, you must use unwieldy guns and vehicles. What is this, Grand Theft Auto? With the vehicles, I was constantly crashing into things. Then the guards would come after me and shoot at me (yet another GTA copy). With the guns, targeting was terribly slow and clunky. I found it easier to just rush the enemy and punch it, which kind of took away the strategy.\n\nI was just so disappointed with this game. After the fun I had with Jak and Daxter, I thought I would have another great series to play. Sadly, I was wrong.","summary":"Terribly disappointing","unixReviewTime":1112486400,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

As soon as Jak opens his mouth to speak, I began to have my doubts. Everything he says he is nasty and his vocal tones are those of the nastiest villians. Granted he is supposed to be under the influence of dark forces and he is grumpy from two years of torture, but still he sounds more like a stock villian then a hero whose fate you are supposed to care about it.\nThe level designs are also unrelentedly difficult. From the very beginning you are faced with challenging moving platforms and with a couple of levels you will be chased by a relentless cannon while jumping blind repeatedly. Poor camera angles, lack of camera control in crucial areas, make already difficult jumps nearly impossible as judging depth is often not possible  and more often then not you are forced to jump blind because you can not see where you need to go next. Rarely is there is no time to pause to study your move and try to rotate the camera (which at some crucial spots simply refuses to budge) because crumbling ledges, firing cannons and their ilk force you to keep hopping from one awkward ledge to the next. You will be forced to endless repeat difficult segements, memorizing the exact route as you will often need to jump blind in order to complete levels. Finely you make it through a difficult segement only to fall off a tiny ledge that lures you off the side by tempting goodies, or shot by an unseen gun, only to be sent bake to the beginning, forced to repeat what you thought mastered until you eyes blur over and you forget why it is you are playing the game. Only sheer stuborness will force you to continue.\nWhen you are not being frustrated by the pooly paced and un-balanced levels, you will be bored by the endless travel by foot or awkward vehicals that you can steal, needed to get between levels, which the game refers to as missions. This aspect of the game might have been amusing as a single section but is otherwise pointless. The vehicals can only be flown at two heights and there is little room to manuver. Everyone just bangs into everyone else. It is like an endless game of bumper cars to get from one place to the other.\nEventually, if you persist, you will realize that both the level difficulty and endless crisscrossings of the hub city to get to each level are only there to pad out what otherwise be a very brief game. It's a shame really, because the story is interesting, the levels bright and intriguing and with just a bit of tuning could have been really fun rather then really frustrating. If ND really wanted to be innovative, there would have a variable level of difficulity and maturity settings. As it is this game will only appeal to the teenager or adult who finds most platforms a piece of cake and longs for a real challenge.","summary":"Mean Spirited","unixReviewTime":1068768000,"vote":"4","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

It does not, nor will it ever feel like Saving Private Ryan, and whoever told you that this was an epic WWII game needs to get their head examined.  While not a bad idea in itself, the game fails to convey the meaning of war.  It is simply a pretty display of new textures and skins, and a lame attempt at character classes a la Return to Castle Wolfenstein.  In the end, it is a mediocre spinoff that screams counter-strike.  The levels feel cramped and it feels like you're playing laser-tag in a room rather than fighting a war out on the fields of battle.  There are few maps and even fewer players actually playing the game.  The Omaha level is a nice try (for the millionth time), but still no cigar.  Consult Medal of Honor or Battlefield 1942 on how to get this level right.  The game is multiplayer ONLY and requires a somewhat fast connection (cable is preferred).  As far as system specifications go, it's the outdated half-life engine with new textures and you should be able to run it with the old system that's collecting dust in the attic.  Purchase at your own risk or download for free if you have half-life or retail version of counter-strike.

How awful Square. How COULD YOU!? Let me count the ways:\n\nVisually, Unlimited SaGa characters & backgrounds aren't animated--everything is entirely static. The only place you get anything resembling modern graphics is in the battle sequences, which feature sprite-based characters and rudimentary 3D backgrounds. So if you like the game's art style, you'll probably enjoy looking at it for a little while, but if you're looking for more-modern graphical fare, Unlimited SaGa won't be the slightest bit exciting. The game's catalog of sound effects is understandably limited, since little of it plays out in anything like an action scene, and the voice acting ranges from bad to horrible. The soundtrack is really good and the only saving grace. I advise buying the soundtrack and PASSING UP the actual game....\n\nThe game's field scenes play out like some ultra bizarre RPG board game. Your character is represented by a tiny static sprite, and you move in hops along preset paths that are presented to you. Each movement may present some form of obstacle or curiosity--you can be attacked, encounter a pitfall, or discover a treasure chest, for instance. None of these are visible on the board, however, so you'll end up stumbling blindly into things quite a bit. This system of exploration, which doesn't actually let you explore much at all, comes off as stilted and constraining. It's also horribly plodding and makes the movement portion of the game feel like a chore.\n\nInteractions with townspeople, and indeed all the dialogue sequences in the game, play out with mere static character portraits and comic-book-style text bubbles. When you're tired of moving a cursor around the town background, you can head to the inn and see what adventures can be undertaken. Sometimes these adventures tie into your character's storyline, but other times they serve no apparent purpose, and after embarking on one you often have to wonder exactly why you're doing what you're doing. The whole process, which is meant to advance the game's plot, ends up being incredibly nonsensical.\n\nThink of USaga as a point & click adventure. Click mouse, move character, fight battle, collect gold, move to next fight.\n\nSuper boring, repetitive, totally lacking of innovation...yup that is Unlimited Saga.","summary":"Could cause violence against PS2 system..proceed with caution!!","unixReviewTime":1141948800,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

Lets look at the graphics. There are limited cut sceens and FMVs and little if any, character animation. If I didn't know it was for a PS2 machine, I would have sworn that the game was produced for the PS1. The graphics aren't bad, but considering the power of the PS2, these graphics are way under par with present day standards. All the art is two-dimensional in nature. Basic game play centers on moving your character from place to place on a world map. You and your party do not walk anywhere, you merely jump from map location to map location. When arriving at a destination, you are presented with another map where you also , move from place to place.\nTypical of all RPGs, your chracters gain skills and abilities as you continue through the game. The battle system is pretty straight forward with an element of chance. Upon the start of a battle, spining circles appear and you have the chance to bring mulitple attacks on the enemy, depending on where you stop the wheels. Your characters do not accumulate experience points as with standard RPGs but instead, you try to protect your characters from losing their LP, or Life Points. You finish each adventure by completing an assignment without losing all your LP.\nThere are seven characters in the game and each one has his or her specific adventure. So in reality, you have seven games in one. Each character has their own story line and specific powers. The weapons for each character have a specific usable lifespan. The more points the weapons have, the longer it will last. The weapons stop working when their durability is all used up. While the weapons are powerful, they do not last forever. You have to make sure that the weapons are only used for the really difficult monsters. During the other times, you can usually defeat the other baddies by using kicks, punches and throws.\nHow fun is this game? Speaking personally, I do not think the game is that entertaining. There is a lot of repetition in the battles and the story lines are very weak. Basically the game can be broken down in these steps: Move, fight or stop, find new place, move, fight or stop, upgrade weapons\/abilities. There is not very much to do outside of these steps. In summary, a pretty disappointing game. With all the great games that SquareSoft has produced over the years, I guess they are allowed a mistake every so often. I believe that Unlimited Saga is one of them.","summary":"A confusing production of an RPG game","unixReviewTime":1067385600,"vote":"16","style":null,"image":null}

There is minimal background scrolling, very little in general going on in the background, and all the levels are very similar looking.  Graphics on the SuperNES were better than this.

Also refilling your meters works entirely different than previous Mega Man games.

Its probably one of the best ideas that had ever been conceived.  Pitting two of the most popular movie monsters of all time against one another in a fight to the death...what could be more fun?  Well, unlike the other Aliens vs. Predator games, AvP:Extinction breaks the First Person Shooter criteria and comes in with a Real-Time Strategy game.  Its a nice attempt, but ultimately flawed.\nThe graphics in the game are sub-par...as far as a strategy game goes they're decent, but just very average...clearly nowhere near the caliber of Warcraft III or Command and Conquer: Generals.  However, examining the creatures up close yields further distortions in graphics.  Some of the aliens look ridiculous, and the Predators look just plain silly.  The design is very cartoonish, just like Aliens vs. Predator 2 for the PC, which many people complained about.  The environments are also very drab and dull...nothing really stands out.  Some of the jungle environments are nice, but most of the environments, such as interior settings and caves, are just lifeless and boring.\nThe game itself is very simplistic.  While creating endless droves of Aliens is alot of fun, the whole game just lacks substance.  Aliens use the Queen to lay eggs, and drag back hosts that they killed (or more likely, just invaded and nearly wiped out your colony the moment the mission started).  The Queen is basically the epicenter of the hive...you purchase all upgrades by selecting her, and using 'currency' earned by killing your enemies, you can upgrade your aliens.  The basic Alien species are there: the warrior, the drone, the dog alien from Alien 3, the praetorian introduced in the AvP games, and new Aliens called 'Ravagers', which are huge, monstrous aliens with blades for hands that rend and maim opponents.  The 'Carrier' is a large Alien that allows facehuggers to attach to its dorsal spines and leap out at enemies as you go.  Nice ideas, though the creatures themselves look uninspired.  All the aliens have unique abilities, and playing as them was an overall fine experience, but the game is just not executed well.\nAs for Predators, you are very limited in forces, which is understandable considering how powerful they are.  The only building they have is the 'Shrine', where upgrades can be purchased and new Predators summoned.  All the Predators have unique abilities and weapons, though some of them look uterly ridiculous...one Predator has a scythe, and it just doesn't go well with the whole Predator look.  Cloaking is utterly useless, since it seems that everyone and everything can see you regardless.  Predators earn curency by killing, as well as taking trophy skulls of their enemies.\nMarines are simple enough to use, though difficult to play.  The 'CommTech' is used to purchase upgrades and summon more units from the dropship.  If the commtech is killed, you're out of luck.  Some of the humans are immensely powerful, which throws the balance of the game off alot.  The marines don't have any structures of any kind, just one landing beacon where the drop ship lands.  Marines earn currency by fixing 'Atmos' which generate steady income.  They must be defended, since Aliens and Predators will try to destroy these every chance they get.\nThe game is unbeleivably difficult...it should be the Aliens that come in countless swarms...not marines and Predators.  The final Alien mission is infuriating...the moment the mission starts out, you are attacked by all three sides (Marine, Predator, Mutant Aliens) and they don't attack each other...they attack you.  Some of the earliest Predator missions open up right into the middle of a fire fight...the Predators should be able to decimate marines but the endless swarm of marines and their incredibly strong fire power are too much.  The game can end before you even get out of the starting area.  As for marines...forget it.  Aliens and Predators swarm you so much you won't even know whats going on half the time.\nOverall, the game's biggest fault is that it was designed narrowly...with the consoles in mind.  All the races, while characteristically different, are fundamentally the same.  None have any structures, other than the main population center (Queen, Shrine, Landing Beacon).  The game is somewhat unbalanced, with some units just being far too powerful.  The idea of Alien procreation is good and is probably one of the best aspects of the game, but this game is just far too basic of an RTS. Perhaps its biggest fault is the complete lack of Multi-player and custom missions.  Once you beat the game, that's it.  You're done.  There is nothing else to do, unless you want to try for a 'medal' by fulfilling all mission requirements in a certain amount of time.  The game is virtually devoid of extras, and there are no ending cinematics...when you beat a campaign...that's it...you're just done.  You won.  Nothing else.  There is no downloadable content or anything else...this is strictly a one-player strategy game that, once beaten, has absolutely nothing else going for it.  This was a decent attempt to expand the Aliens vs. Predator franchise into a new game genre...but it fails.  Perhaps they should've paid more attention to existing strategy games...its utter lack of options and extras throws this game back almost ten years...compared to other RTS games, it is basic and completely mediocre.  The game was fun, but it took only about 2 or 3 days to complete, and playing it anymore beyond that became pointless, because there was nothing else to do.\nThis just further proves that RTS games belong on PCs, not consoles.  Had this game been released for the PC, with multi-player options, extra content, and a better game engine overall, then this would have been a winner.  As it stands, it was a decent but failed attempt.","summary":"A nice try, but...","unixReviewTime":1061251200,"vote":"21","style":null,"image":null}

It is true the game does have good lighting effects but they do not over shadow the otherwise bland and boring level disign. Also the rag doll physics are realy lame and unrealistic.

The 3.5 rules are well implemented.  The story line is pretty good, and the game is a nice mix of hack and slash and dialogue based quests. The lack of character customization when it came to the appearance of the characters bothered me a little bit, but certainly didn't ruin the game for me.  I certainly would have prefered a bit better graphics, but again the graphics weren't terrible either.\n\nThis game is a real nice introduction to classic D&D, but those all ready familiar with the game may be wishing for some more areas to explore (the game is kinda limited in this respect).  I have a feeling that while I've never played the original Temple of Elemental Evil that it was meant more as an introductory adventure anyhow, this game certainly felt that way.  I also really didn't like that your only option for character building was the dice rolling method, when most games now a days are implementing the point buy system for stats as an option, and I much prefer that option.\n\nThe real downfall of this game is it was released with a major flaw.  On some systems it runs fine, while on others it is completely unplayable without a patch.  It is simply ridiculous that a game will not even play on some computers that meet the system requirements.  When I buy a product, I at least expect it to have been well enough made to run on a machine that meets all the requirments, without having to download a patch.

I played the original NWN without a problem (skipped SoU) as well as dozens of other games, all with my existing hardware, software and configuration.  I'm running all mainstream stuff:\nWin2k, Service Pack 4 with all relevant hotfixes (so...5,000).\nATI Radeon 9700 Pro - great card.\nAMD 2200+ on an Abit mobo, 512 ram.\nPatch 1.62, installed on March 12th 2004.\nSo basically what happens is the game either locks up during a save and after about 30 seconds crashes to desktop corrupting that save file in the process, or the system reboots.  Neither scenario gives any warning and if I play for 3-4 hours then I'm about guarunteed to have at least one of each crash.\nSo the game is great.  Graphics are nice, sound is fine, nothing special.  The battles are a lot of fun and I really enjoy watching my dwarven fighter charge a drow cleric amid fire and ice storms.  The power given to you is awesome as your guy gets around level 20, and since the game starts off with you generating a character and leveling it up to level 15 you can customize the bejeezus out of it.  The game bogs down a little sometimes, which annoys me since I greatly exceed the recommended specs, but that doesn't happen enough for it to be a problem.\nSummary:\nBuy this game if you liked NWN, it is tons of fun.  But either research your PC setup online to see if others are having problems or at least wait until patch 1.62 is no longer the latest.  I'm going to think really hard before buying Atari again.\nUPDATE: I updated my graphics driver to the latest catalyst driver from ATI (version 4.3 at this time) and the machine reboots seem to have stopped.  However the game still locks up about 1 time in 10-20 while saving.  I hit ctrl+alt+delete and kill the process after it freezes and I've caught the game using 210MB of memory!  The log files it says it is generating are useless, they just describe event within the game itself before it crashes.\nMaybe Atari is one of those things to avoid now so as to keep our fond childhood memories....","summary":"Keeps crashing!

The ending has you going through the very same Onyx Tower as in the first (although the story explains this well), and the final battle is largely identical to that in DA I.\n\nOne oft-heard criticism of Dark Alliance I was that it was too short:  if you sat down in the morning with it, you could definitely get through the game in one day, by afternoon or early evening.  I think the gamemakers took that criticism to heart when they made this sequel:  no getting through this one in a day.  Unfortunately, that was accomplished not by adding more mazes and monsters but simply by having each level by interminably long and repetitive.  Bigger mazes are not necessarily better, especially if it's just the same ol' stuff over and over again.\n\nWhenever I get in the mood to play hack-and-slash, I always play through the first one.

Horizons does many things right, but has a few things wrong with it that really ruin the game experience.\nGraphics look good, but not always smooth.  A high end system is required to run this game and you'll be tweaking the settings even with the best of systems.  As the biggest memory hog game ever created, it will chew through 1 gig of memory real quick and a Radeon 9800 pro 256 becomes \"not enough\".  There's a good side of this though:  Even at low settings, it looks great and you will spend time just staring at the landscape and stars.  Like EQ, most lag occurs in high populated areas such as towns and cites probley a result of bad net code just as much as graphics.\nHorizons has the best sound and music I've heard in a game.  They really spent some time and did it right and the music will haunt you once you hear it.  It changes as you enter different environments and really enhances your experience.  Game designers can learn alot from Horizons when it comes to the music.\nThe main challenge facing Horizons is it's content.  There's barely any at all.  The only real content you'll find in horizons is what you create yourself.  Quests usually involve collecting 10 things of \"this\" or kill 30 of \"that\" and are just plain stupid. Many quests will have you running here or running there being a mad messenger of sorts.  While this follows what's been seen in other MMORPG's, Horizons fails in it's attempt as there's no real sense of danger in it.  Dying in Horizons gives you a \"death penalty ticket\".  You don't have to get back to your corpse, no loss of XP, you just get a ticket that reduces your effectiveness for eight hours.  I have never felt this effect and can't tell the difference.  There is no fear of death in Horizons, no real penalty.  Go ahead and kill that big golumn, it doesn't matter if you die, you can just try again.  There's no real sense of adventure here.\nCrafting becomes tedious.  The placement of resources in the game at higher tiers is designed to get you running back and forth for hours between gathering and processing of them.  While many things are done right with the way Horizons does crafting, it becomes a chore.  Spending four hours mining ore and creating things raising your level, then rinse and repeat.\nWhere's my monsters?  While other games had all sorts of monsters everywhere you run, Horizons has hardly any. They usually group in area's and can easily be avoided.  Even if they do come at you you can easily outrun them.  For fun I aggro'd an entire army of undead and tried to train them into town.  In other games this would be a horrible thing, but in Horizons they just head directly back and give up at a certain point - not going after anyone else they pass along the way.  Again, there's no sense of danger here.\nUnlike others, the game bugs are providing me with an endless source of entertainment.  I don't get upset like so many others.  It adds a challenge when the game crashes right in the middle of taking on two higher level creatures, or right when my group needs me the most.  It adds a real world element to the game and sense of urgency as I scramble to get back in through the web portal they've created.  To me, this is a game feature that should be explored further and could really invoke some strong gameplayer emotions.  The Devs are scrambling.\nI have hopes for this game.  There are many things to like about it and it seems a shame that it was rushed out the door so quickly.  They can fix it.  I think it will be a better game in a couple of months.  With the other MMORPG's coming (World of Warcraft\/EQ II) it had better be.","summary":"Working on being a great game","unixReviewTime":1071273600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

In fact, the game plays a lot like one on one extreme dodgeball. The action is fast and frantic. There are two opponents on seperate sides divided by a line. If you cross the line, you lose life every 3 seconds or something like that. You pick up power ups that can be used to conjure up monsters or to cast spells. The more powerups you have the more stuff you can throw at the other guy. So basically you pick up white balls off the ground and then you use their power to send monsters to hit the other guy. Unlike dodgeball, though, you could even run over to the other side to steal your opponents power ups, or better yet, join your little monsters in the beatings. I guess it's more like streetfighter\/dodgeball. The game is action packed, and it's somewhat entertaining, especially when playing with friends. I wouldn't consider this a strategy or RPG, but it's easily worth its bargain bin price. With this game, you definately get what you pay for.

Each time you win you are rewarded with a new spell.  Each of these quests consists of about 15 - 20 battles until you get to the \"boss\" battle.  Defeating this boss gets you one of 5 colored gem on the way to completing the entire quest.\nAs has been noted by other reviewers, the battles tend to be either so easy that you beat them on the first try, or so frustrating that you give up after hours of trying.  When games are this tough it's always a signal to me that the game play is so thin that they make it very hard in an attempt to make things seem deeper.\nBut the more you play the quest and arcade modes, the more spells and characters you can get in order to fight on-line.  You can pick your skill lever and your cards and battle it out against friends or foe from around the country.\nFrankly I'm a bit disappointed in that it seems there are not many online players for this game.  I find it surprising given the popularity of the game, but as I said, the game is not very in depth with only some 70 or so odd spells and I think experienced Magic players may be turned off by this.\nAlso, thus far there has been ZERO new content to download while a game like Rainbow Six 3 has provided 5 new maps already.\nIt's not a horrible game but I have to guess it's just not deep enough for experience Magic fans and just not fun enough for new players.","summary":"JUST AN OK GAME","unixReviewTime":1080172800,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

The whole game is a bit of a mish mash of CGI footage and actual movie footage which really makes the game feel like it is cut and pasted.\nThe CGI is pretty good though a bit foggy looking like the beginning of Resident Evil Remake for Nintendo ( meaning there is a slight blur to it all). The movie scenes are good but just seemed un-nesccary and really didn't add anything to the game (if i wanted to see the film id get that).\nThe controls are relatively easy and don't take much time to pick up. Probabely because you will be doing the same thing over and over again. The AI in the game respawn in certain areas and you will be contiunally shooting those damn flying machines forever thinking \" im getting bored of this\". The developers just throws AI at you with the occasional mission directive (like find Sarah Connors coffin)and think they have this new sensational game. No they don't !!!!!!\nDon't be fooled either by there campaign that they have the REAL man himself and that this makes the game better than any other. Arnold really doesn't have alot to do with this game. Basically all Arnold had to do for this game was go in a sound booth for a minute say 10 words like \" excellent\" \" reloaded\" and so forth and here we have the result. A game that really is repeative in every way and has no real distinction over other Terminators games for having the big fella involved.\nThe environments are mostly from the future setting with black charcol skys and burnt building and out of 22 levels about 18 of these are all like this. Boring, Dull and just too similar for anyone to care.\nAnd this whole first person shooter cross bred with fist fighting ????? Yer, it works and i didn't mind the bouts with the T-X. I even get the lack of fluidity with the controls as these are machines fighting not kung-fu max payne rip offs. But still, it nuthin revoultionary or really adds a great deal for the game play. Though this was my favourite part of the game and trust me thats not saying much.\nI played the whole thing through even though i got bored after the first 4 levels. The whole thing is a un-insipring mess that is not the NEXT big thing in gaming nor a decent add on to the Terminator mythos.\nConclusion: A big commerical mess that does not deliver on any of it's promises.

I did not bother checking out the multiplayer because I heard that there's no servers and if you do get into one, bunch of people get disconnected. Anyway, here's what I don't like and what I like:\n\nI like the main menu music. I like the graphics in this one compare to OFP. I like the combat sounds too. Picking the weapon you want is easier than OFP by pushing the numbers above your QWERTY keys. AI's are much smarter, making the game more realistic. They will try to outflank you. They will take cover behind trees, rocks, and buildings. Oh yeah, you can swim in this game. In the first OFP, you drown in the water. That's about it.\n\nNow here's what I don't like:\n1) Its more complicated to control your squad. Have to cycle through bunch of menus to get the right command I want.\n2) As mention with other reviews, no free look when driving. I can't look to my right or left or behind me.\n3) No tutorial or training missions. If you are brand new to the game, don't you want to learn how to fight and move and all the other goodies before going to combat?\n4) Default key assignments are ridiculous. Push F1 to use binocular? Then you have to hold the right mouse button to use it. I don't think you can even zoom with it. I pushed every button on my keyboard to see if I can zoom, but nope.\n5) No ability to lean left or right, which is huge deal when peaking or shooting around corners.\n6) If you get into a vehicle first, your squad may sometime go in with you without you having to give them an order. I'm like, \"did i order you to get in my vehicle?\"\n7) You are stuck with the weapon you have before starting the mission! I like the option of choosing different weapons before starting the mission, but apparently it won't let you.\n8) When changing weapon, it takes forever for your guy to get that weapon out, especially when you take your rocket launcher out. If you need to get your rifle back out after switching, forget about it. Your dumb guy wants to put a rocket into the launcher first before getting to your other weapon.\n9) It is always a 4 man team. Unlike the first OFP where you can control as many as 12 men. However, you are always the team leader from the very first mission.\n10) Low lack of vehicles to get into. You are mostly running all over the place.\n11) Mission editor sucks b\/c there's no preview for it.\n\nI think the main thing the frustrates me the most is giving commands to your squad. This is truly a waste of my $37! Why there's no CD-key? I bought this game b\/c I thought I will need a CD-key to play online. APPARENTLY NOT! I bet this game is already free for download on file-sharing programs and you can play online without any CD-key check. Of course, the multiplayer is currently in disarray and they are currently making a patch for this game.\n\nI don't know if future patches to this game will make gaming experience better. They tend to make it better, but I still don't want to cycle through bunch of menus to give orders to my squad. I remember installing patches one by one for OFP and that took forever. You have to install the very first patch to install the most recent patch. You probably will have to do that too for this game as well.\n\nIn summary, don't buy this game. Its very disappointing and it doesn't even come close to Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis or OFP Resistance. If they implement the old OFP features with the awesome graphics and sounds, this game would of been the best Operation Flashpoint ever to be made.","summary":"Much worser than OFP","unixReviewTime":1255737600,"vote":"6","style":{"Platform:":" PC"},"image":null}

I guess I'll start by saying how wrong people are when they call this game a \"mil sim\".\n\nThere's so many examples it's hard to choose from, but lets start with a good one.\n\nIf you ask the corpsman to heal you.. He gives you a shot of adrenaline (I would have to assume its that and not just some silly yellow colored saline solution). If you give someone adrenaline and they've received some massive trauma you're only going to help KILL the person. If you don't know anything about Adrenaline or how the human body works... Easily put, it's going to make them bleed out faster because adrenaline is going to increase their heart rate which is bad (In this case). Not to mention the animation of the corpsman giving you the shot is horrible, but most animations in this game are - so don't be surprised.\n\nThis is honestly more like a mix of call of duty and battlefield 2.\n\nI personally had high hopes for this game. While I was pointing out a lot of its mistakes and problems early on, I've always loved the operation flashpoint games, they were some of my favorites many years ago. But this is a horrible disappointment, at least in regards to it being a \"mil sim\" and an operation flashpoint game.\n\nAlso another big gripe is shooting, sure the sounds sound like they were recorded in a very confined indoor shooting range. So when you're shooting outdoors it sounds terrible and also it seemed as though a lot of the weapons that you fire lack a lot of the bite that their real counterparts have. To me the game felt like there was very little weight, everything felt very \"floaty\", for the lack of a better word. It's hard to describe but it just didn't feel right from the very beginning.\n\nAlso, speaking about shooting, it takes about 5 - 7 rounds, on average, to take down someone. Of course these vary, some less than others depending on the round and placement but the enemies generally just stand there or continue crawling taking hit after hit and the simple fact that it takes SO MANY rounds to take down someone makes this game laughable.\n\nEven a single round or two from an m16 or m4 type variant can easily put someone to the ground even with some sort of armor (It might not kill them but either way they WONT be standing by their own will and strength after that type of impact). You're talking about almost 3,000 fps (Feet per second) from an m4. Obviously, more or less depending on the round, grain, and barrel. Now a round from an m4 or m16 puts out almost 1,680 joules that equates to about 1,238 foot pounds of force. My calculations might be off a little, I'm not much of a math wiz but you still get the idea. That's A LOT of force. Of course' there's always little variables, you can say \"Well in this case\" or \"in this particular instance\" but having to take that many shots on the \"hardcore\" difficulty to take someone down is ridiculous.\n\nBack on point. There are so many mechanics of this game that are so unrealistic that calling this a \"mil sim\" is a huge slap in the face to anything else that's even halfway realistic.\n\nNot to mention to lack of variants in firearms as well and customization options. You should at least be able to switch out your m4 or what have you with other optics like acogs, eotechs, aimpoints, cco's and such. But no, you're stuck with whats on the rifle. Different rifles have different sights, but there aren't even that many to choose from.\n\n(Also when you shoot people you get a little tick mark on the crosshair, I think that speaks for itself.)\n\nThere's also the simple fact that this game is not even that difficult. I probably only died maybe half a dozen to a dozen times or so throughout the course of the campaign and I always play all of my fps games on their hardest difficulty. But I guess that could just be due to my past league xp, being ex cal and cevo main (I know, it's not that big of a deal but it's better than the majority) for games like 1.6, css, cod4, I honestly didn't have much of any difficulty with this game especially with the horrendous ai.\n\nThe main problems I did encounter however is with the other members of your fire team.\n\nOften times I had to tell them to board my vehicle, then if a fire fight ensued and I had to leave the vehicle to find some real cover I would find that my team mates were still sitting there and doing (For the most part) nothing. It's just a hassle having to bring up the command menu and telling them to get out of the vehicle every time, although I can see how it might be a benefit. Like if you just had to run out really quick to grab something and didn't want your team to dismount. But more often than naught, it's an annoyance.\n\nThe only real use for them is to lay down some sort of suppressing fire if you're advancing on a location like in Brothers in Arms: HH. Or for having them point out obvious (And sometimes not so obvious) threats.\n\nAlso if your team is in a vehicle and you look at them they're often just stuck in a single pose. They don't move, they don't do anything at all. They're frozen in a single pose and don't move until something happens. I know it might not sound like something important but if you're playing and you hop out and look at your team mates frozen there it really does kill quite a bit of the experience.\n\nThere is also a very limited amount of vehicles you can operate. Don't be fooled in thinking you can fly and drive everything under the sun, well you can... It's just that there's not a lot of variety. I think it's about on par with vehicles on BF2. Maybe more, maybe less. There's something like a total of 50 vehicles however they're not all playable... Well you can play with them in the mission editor so I guess that still counts right?\n\nMultiplayer? What a mess.\n\nFirst of all, there's no dedicated servers. Which for consoles is ok, but for pc's... Yuck. And it's funny how on the pc packaging it says under its multiplayer requirements that \"Dedicated host server are recommended for optimum performance\". Neat stuff huh? That might change in the future.. If someone has their own dedicated box that they're willing to host from but as of yet (Or to my knowledge) codemasters hasn't provided any files for hosting the dedicated server.\n\nThere's also a very limiting amount of people you can play with.\n\nIf you want to play co-op, know that it's only on-line co-op. You can't play co-op offline. And when you're playing online, there's a max of 4 players. There's no ability to \"drop in\" or \"drop out\" per say. There's supposedly a max of like 32 people on things like deathmatch and the other non co-op modes. BUT remember, since there's no dedicated servers... Hosting even 20 people is going to be a challenge. You're probably going to find servers from 10 - 16 people max. At least, to have good enough and playable ping.\n\nThere's a lot wrong with this game and very few things right. The graphics aren't that great (Trust me, in the videos they look way better) but even with the settings maxed, at 1280x1024, with full aa and all the ingame settings set to full I was left with a big emptiness because this just wasn't what I was looking for. Plus there isn't that many settings to change either. You can't change the draw\/view distance, you can't change things like the post effects, or details in the terrain, players, etc.\n\nThe textures are terrible on more than one occasion. If you go to your map and zoom in, the map of the island is so low res that it becomes very pixelated before you even zoom all the way in to see your troops. The textures on rocks and the landscape in general are terrible. The uv mapping on them is awful, there's lots of stretching going on and most of it is hidden by the games grass (Which looks pretty awful by todays standards).\n\nNeedless to say, I was highly disappointed with this release. However, this game isn't all that bad. Sure, the graphics suck, a lot of the animations are terrible, it's not realistic, the sound isn't even half good. But it's not a completely awful game. This is JUST another badly produced, over hyped, rushed shooter. That's it.\n\nIf it was $15 then it might be acceptable but even at $40, it's not worth your time or money.\n\nAnd don't listen to the operation flashpoint fan boys who rate this as the most amazing game ever. If this was tetris with the operation flashpoint name and called it a \"mil sim\" there would still be \"amazing\" reviews about it. Don't listen to the fan boys, you can read tons of reviews from REAL people who have REAL reviews about this all over.","summary":"\"Mil Sim\"?

While this may seem like a good deal, you can actually buy the second expansion in the Civilization series, Civilization: Conquests, which is included with the first expansion as well. So if you'd like an even better deal, buy a copy of the original Civilization game (which sells for a VERY cheap price new or used) and then buy the Civilization: Conquests expansion and you'll spend the same amount you would for the Gold Edition, get the expansion Civilization: Play the World as well as new content in Civilization: Conquests.  If you'd like to know what the Gold Edition brings to the table, basically the purpose of the Play the World expansion was to enable multiplayer, a feature once originally promised in the original game.  Atari probably realized it could make more money holding out multiplayer in an expensive expansion pack but if you never gave in to Atari's demands, now is your chance to try it.  Multiplayer is a bit of a disappointment in Civilization.  The online community isn't large and it's not the same thing as randomly joining a server in a first person shooter or other poppular online game because of the dedication required for long online games.  One reason the community isn't that large is because when Play the World was first released it was a buggy disaster! The online game was full of lag no matter what game mode or connection speed you used. Some of the common problems have been fixed with patches but multiplayer has never been a great success with Civilization.  Play the World even introduces a simultaneous turn mode which allows the game to speed up and imitates the mechanics of a real-time strategy game.  Unfortunately, Civ 3 really isn't meant to be a real-time strategy game and it doesn't run as smoothly as a Rise of Nations or Warcraft game would.  If you have a home LAN, that's probably the best way to play Civilization against others.  The most successful method of play is still singleplayer, though, so I recommend you buy the Conquests expansion along with the original Civilization game like I mentioned above because that expansion does a better job adding more features for singleplayer but also comes included with the content in Play the World.","summary":"Nice Game but Unnecessary Purchase","unixReviewTime":1076112000,"vote":"95","style":null,"image":null}

In addition to all the other frustrations voiced, the online play is horrendous. It is the slowest first person shooter online of any game I've played. And I've played a ton of them. I had a straight ethernet hookup to my campus's network. My average bandwidth was about 2.7 Meg\/sec. That's about 20 times the average bandwidth of DSL (I'm talking average, not peak). I have a 2.4 Gig processor with 512 meg ram and a radeon 9600 video card. I was STILL having lag. It was almost comical it was so bad sometimes.

To get a better idea of how unpopular this has become, go to bungie.net and click on their link to Halo for PC. Take a quick gander at how many people are playing at any given time. I just checked and it was 2455. This is worldwide, mind you. Doesn't that seem rather low? Even now, over 10 times that many people are playing Starcraft, a dinosaur compared to Halo.\nI have sold my copy of Halo PC to some poor schmoe. (Sorry, poor schmoe). Someday maybe in 100 years when I have bionic implants to sustain my pathetic life and the world is on a fiber optic network, you will catch me playing Halo for PC. In the meantime, I guess Starcraft will have to do... For Adun!","summary":"Slowest online play in the world","unixReviewTime":1087171200,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

EA decided to leave the frontlines of Europe and head to Hawaii at Pearl Harbor and into the Japanese and Philippine frontlines. It's a nice change of scenery, especially back in the day when WWII shooters were coming out nearly every day. The problem is, Rising Sun is a reskin of Frontline with the lack of polish, detail, and just doesn't feel complete. Rising Sun needed about 6 months more of development before being anything remotely decent. What we have here is a sluggish, boring, and mediocre shooter, probably one of the worst shooters of 2003.\n\nThe game actually starts out pretty nicely. The bombing of Pearl Harbor feels epic in this game, you are just a nobody sailor who gets woken up by the bombings. After you see the poorly pre-rendered cut scene you start controlling your guy and it feels very similar to Frontline, too similar. Right off the bat you realize the control issues haven't changed. The aiming is really sensitive and finicky, there's no iron sights aiming, and the controls just suck still. Once you run around the boat trying to escape you notice you can save at checkpoints. This is actually one of the only two major issues that were fixed from Frontline. The missions are very long and you no longer have to start at the beginning of every level when you die.\n\nOnce you get out you notice the framerate is worse than Frontline. The FPS drops into single digits often and it actually affects gameplay. Trying to shoot someone when the game is chugging along at 5 frames a second is nearly impossible. It doesn't help that the aiming is already wonky. The change of pace in the beginning using the turret on the boat and shooting down planes is fun, I also have to mention that the only great part of Rising Sun is the music. Medal of Honor has a fantastic score across all the WWII games, but Rising Sun needs more than that to save it.\n\nOnce you start the next level you realize the game is just so bad. The level design is abysmal with confusing mazes, it was cute for EA to try to make you feel like you have multiple paths but you really don't. It just makes things more confusing. There are also secondary hidden objectives this time around but they are nearly impossible to figure out, hell even the regular objectives are hard to figure out. Items don't flash so you can't tel if it's part of the scenery or something you need to interact with. Most of the time you just get lucky when a prompt comes up on screen when you pass something.\n\nI like the new selection of weapons, the shotgun, Type 99, Sten MKII, and a few other Pacific Theatre weapons. That's probably the only other great change from Frontline, but the guns control so horribly that you won't care. The most annoying part of Rising Sun is the forced and failed implementation of stealth. During one of the last few levels you get recruited into the OSS and have to infiltrate a Japanese summit at a hotel. The game gives you the Welrod which is a one shot silenced pistol. Sure that's fine, but Rising Sun wasn't built for stealth. I shot the first few people silently then all of a sudden I was being attacked. I had to run around the whole level with just a pistol and the Welrod. Not very fun. The hints say to stick to the shadows and stay in the column areas. Yeah sure what shadows? The stealth is just completely broken, but at least healing items give you more health so the game is a bit easier in that regard.\n\nLet's finally talk about graphics, the game is butt ugly, even uglier than Frontline. During the jungle levels the devs just put a flat texture of a forest on the walls. Yeah good jobs you lazy jerks. The game is just ugly and is so unpolished. The events in the game are so unbelievable that it's hard to think that these things actually happened. Did I mention there's still no blood? The last thing to go is the terrible AI. The friendly AI just stands there while they're being shot and completely ignore enemies, the multiplayer is also as boring as ever.\n\nRising Sun sold millions of copies, but couldn't live up to the previous games quality. With ugly graphics, horrible framerate, terrible AI, bad level design and various other issues, Rising Sun stands as one of the worst games in the series.","summary":"Worst MoH game next to Airborne","unixReviewTime":1369267200,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

X6 is the very worst of course and I highly doubt my feelings with change there.\n\nX7 has its share of flaws however.  It's amazing Capcom actually thought blending 2D with 3D would be the wave of the future for the series.  They apparently didn't realize Mega Man maintaining 2D roots with fast-paced action is the reason we fell in love with the series so much.  You can't really make a change of this magnitude without lots of backlash from fans.  With that said however, the game likes to take elements of 3D and combine them with classic side scroller 2D the entire way through the game.  I'd say there's some occasions this combination works really well, but there's other times the 3D portions either become monotonous, tedious or just horrible.\n\nWell instead of playing as X from the beginning, for a good chunk of the game you have to play as a much weaker, wimpier character named Axl.  His name makes him sound tough, but he's anything but.  You can also play as Zero but unfortunately his saber is much slower this time around which means you often leave yourself wide open to enemy attacks\/retaliation if you're just out of their reach, and this game has a way of not seeming very dangerous at first until you realize you're being overwhelmed.  It's usually a gradual process when the danger surrounds you, but thankfully not NEARLY as brain-smashingly hard as in X6.  Yes, X6 is all about smashing our brains into walls with its neverending needless difficulty, haha!\n\nAnyway with Zero's saber there's no real strategy- just go in and slice enemies.  Axl is basically a really weak version of X as I mention above.  You can switch between Axl and Zero throughout most of the first half of the game, and when X comes in you can switch between Axl, Zero and X.  You can only take two of these characters with you per stage.  The ability to switch between two characters is a nice throwback to X3 and I like it.\n\nAs far as graphics go, well in some stages they're really unique (Radio Tower for example, and Deep Forest) but otherwise they tend to be dark and uninspiring (like the intro stage).  It's almost like Capcom thought that using dark graphics would disguise the blandness of the stages, or that the darkness would play into a more realistic\/serious setting.  Either way it's unimpressive.  Now the awful news- you have to rescue reploids AGAIN!  Yes I know, this idea was atrocious and unnecessary in X6 and unfortunately they brought it back again in X7.  Talk about a lousy attempt to extend the gameplay.  If they want to add replay value, how about stepping away from the usual 8 levels\/boss battles and give us 12 stages and bosses?  Anyway I believe you can collect 64 reploids which is less than half compared to X6.\n\nThe atmosphere in the game is similar to a Metroid Prime game oddly enough, and the 3D mechanics are strikingly similar to Metroid: Other M.  I realize this game came out way before Other M but similarities are noticeable in the atmosphere.  The voice acting... REALLY REALLY AWFUL!  Yes, I had to state that in big words so everyone could see- the voice acting is just atrocious.  Zero's voice is too deep and manly, Axl sounds like a little kid playing in a sandbox but X... X's voice is the worst one of all.  I've never heard such a bloated overdramatic way of speaking since Richter from the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night days and actually thought such exceptionally bad voice acting would have been eliminated by this point in time (2003 when X7 was released).  Apparently not!  Bosses can speak annoyingly too as I'll mention below but for different reasons (repetition).\n\nThe problem with the voice acting is that all the dialogue text is now spoken, so we hear all these characters speak.  It makes the game feel way less like an action\/shoot 'em up Mega Man video game adventure and more like a low budget cartoon.  Proof that voice acting doesn't belong in the Mega Man series unless it's only used occasionally like in X4.  The truth is all the voice acting sounds like little kids in a high school play reciting lines and their interpretation of what they believe is acceptable, but for those of us playing the game and especially those of us who grew up with the NES and Super NES games, we realize just how unnecessary, distracting and grating this stuff sounds since we know X or Zero should *not* sound the way they do here.  You'll quickly realize how bad the voice acting is after the opening stage when Axl, X and Zero have a conversation.  It's so wrong it hurts.\n\nWhat else can I say before moving on to describing the stages and bosses?  Well Axl's charge shot is very weak.  The animations you see when Axl, Zero or X die are all really bland and identical.  Unfortunately sometimes you still have to risk unnecessary life or death instances while rescuing tricky placed reploids such as when they're placed over spiked areas.  Not as overwhelmingly annoying rescuing them compared to X6 due to spikes only appearing sometimes and due to Capcom easing up on placing reploids over bottomless pits, but unfortunately rescuing them is still occasionally an issue.  The gameplay seems to be a little slow in my opinion.  The X series is supposed to move much faster than the original Mega Man games, at least that's the impression I get since the original Mega Man X on the Super NES moved along at a SUPER fast pace the moment you obtained the dash ability.  This game feels slow in comparison to the previous X titles, and I have a feeling the reason is to compliment the 3D elements.  Maybe the slower speed is Capcom's way of making the game seem more realistic or maybe the game has trouble functioning going back and forth between 2D and 3D sections all the time.  Who knows the real reason.\n\nAt least X's charged shot is superior to Axl's, but I have to wonder if it's just exaggerated eye candy.  I mean X's shot is so huge it fills up a good chunk of the screen!  Looks like a massive blue fireball shooting forward, haha.  Anyway I like how X can shoot upward or downward.  There's also a glide or fly move that looks unintentionally hilarious to me since it's so out of place for an X game.  Capcom obviously wanted to change the series completely with this game, that much I do know by looking at the graphics and how the game plays.  Also before I forget to mention it, this game has a severe shortage of energy capsules.  Just try your best not to take damage.  It's not an impossibly hard game like X6, but it's certainly challenging enough that you'll want to avoid taking damage as much as possible.\n\nAlright let's discuss the levels...\n\nThe Lava Factory has a pretty strong atmosphere despite the fact it's just a typical factory setting with areas of lava.  This level is unique in that the first half is all about typical 2D side scroller shooting and the second half is all 3D-focused involving several tricky jumps across awkwardly placed platforms avoiding or shooting red dragons coming out of the lava or pesky red laser beams.  The 3D platforming portion of this stage lasts a long time which is annoying.  Radio Tower is based around a spiral staircase-like setting similar to Split Mushroom's spiral areas from X4.  Creative use of 2D and 3D blended together, and even more creative is the mini boss fight I guess you could say, who stays in the middle of the room as you progress up the stairs avoiding rockets and fireballs from all kinds of surrounding danger (including the boss himself such as his claw move which is used to halt your progression).  This stage is pretty awesome I admit.\n\nThe Battleship stage is all about total 3D level design running between crates and avoiding explosions.  The enemy variety is unusual here- you battle blue birds positioned on platforms with their own shooting attacks.  Perhaps the 3D setting is hte reason this area so unusual.  Basically the entire Battleship stage feels awkward since it's split between a few different 3D areas, and that's it.  A failed experiment on the part of Capcom.  Others may disagree with me however and see it as an experimental success.  However with that said, the huge robotic mid-level boss is REALLY cool.  He's elaborate and intimidating enough to almost be a regular boss!\n\nDeep Forest is another pretty decent stage.  I love the dark green forest in the background which is realistic enough to remind me of something out of Metroid Prime 3, and the best use of 3D occurs in this level- around the halfway point when you walk down a hill, the camera switches to a 3D effect.  It's subtle and most people probably won't care or admire it enough to compliment, but I think it's a genius idea to implement 3D portions in this one specific area since the appearance is so beautiful.  It's *very* effective and adds to the atmosphere.  The enemy variety is poor however- you shoot bees all over the place, and even more plentiful are these boring stone moving enemies that move up and down with green lights attached to them.  They're sort of like thwomps from the Mario Bros. series.  You can climb over them or dash under them.  The rolling boulders are a little better but due to Axl being so weak, not that much fun either I'm afraid.\n\nNow let's mention the AWFUL levels- the next four.  One in particular is atrocious enough to never pick this game up again.\n\nCentral Circuit is all about a slow-moving 3D race on your ride chaser which basically another version of the jet bike.  You have to take it slow in order to rescue all the reploids.  I hate the idea of basing an entire level around the driving mechanic unless it's high-speed action.  This however, is lackluster.  At least the glowing green sky over a futuristic dreary setting is nice.  Tunnel Base is one major problem after another.  The stage feels 3 times bigger than the other 7 levels for one thing so it's clearly overlong.  You ride blue and red armor robots in the first two sections while shooting laser beams or stomp the ground for a shockwave effect across narrow hallways while dealing with dark uninspiring surroundings.  Make that WAY too dark in this case.  When the third half arrives and the stage feels like it's trying to develop into something more, it's evident this is nothing but generic destruction involving spamming the ride armor and punching enemies in an open 3D setting.  I hate this kind of gameplay a lot.\n\nAir Forces is an exceptionally bad level.  You begin by jumping from airplane to airplane way up high in the sky which in theory seems like an amazing idea, but the execution is furiously difficult.  I love the cloud effects here however.  You basically have to glide from one plane to another without jumping short and falling which is much harder than it sounds.  In the second half you must avoid giant blue laser beams swaying back and forth in a 3D isometric setting.  I really wish the first part of this level was designed differently because the good news is that the third portion of this level is where you go deep inside the ship and the atmosphere gets really thick and enjoyable here.  The third portion saves this level from mediocrity however...\n\nThe worst level I've ever played in a Mega Man game (well besides the Clown Man stage in MM8) occurs next.  Cyber Field.  I HATE this level!  It consists of nothing but blue platforms shaped like pentagons in a generic futuristic setting with no personality whatsoever, and teleportation *overload*.  I can't even figure out how to navigate this confusing place without using a guide- I need to actually see someone play this game on youtube in order to figure my way through.  This is because all the areas look identical.  To make matters worse, there's even an upside down segments that must be completed around halfway through.  UGH!!\n\nNow onto the bosses.  Soldier Stonekong makes amazing use of 3D effects similar to the spiral staircase level I mention above, except you go around in a circle on a stone structure.  Fun boss too since his attack patterns are exciting to dodge.  Tornado Tonion has an annoying and repetitive squeaky Asian voice and it's especially awful hearing \"ah!\" every time you hit him.  However once again this boss fight is fun.  Splash Warfly offers suspense whenever he jumps out of the water and surprises you.  Flame Hyenard does the WORST THING EVER!  He won't stop screaming \"Burn to the ground!\" a hundred times in a row!  This is why voice acting is a serious negative in my book, for reprehensible moments such as these.  This particular boss is really boring and feels like it's missing something, since it takes place on top of a giant robot.  It's almost like the robot itself should have been the boss fight instead.\n\nRide Boarski is an *extremely* hard and long boss fight with the camera positioned showing a faraway aerial view of a gated platform where the battle takes place, and you have to avoid fireball attacks and prepare yourself for moments of slowdown which is odd.  Snipe Anteator's battle takes place on a see-through tunnel leading to the ceiling.  While the setting is cool, the boss battle is annoyingly difficult since he mostly stays on the other side of the tunnel on the opposite side of your shooting range.  Then he cheap shots by spamming blasts which are hard to avoid.  Wind Crowrang is notable for X's hilariously bad voice acting before the battle begins.  He once again sounds pretentiously heroic.  Very similar to Richter from Castlevania: Symphony of the Night like I mention above.  The boss fight itself is awesome since it's 2D fast-paced action which is *just* the way I like X games.  Vanishing Gungaroo contains more hilariously awful\/overdramatic voice acting from X and the boss' voice here isn't any better.  This is a bland and generic fight where you simply jump around shooting in a 3D environment.  Totally forgettable.\n\nThe Sigma boss fight is pretty awesome at least.  The first round is all about 2D jumping, dodging and attacking like in Vanishing Gungaroo, then the second form is pure 3D perfection with a screen-sized Sigma and avoiding his many moves while standing on top of a series of platform, and countering attacks accordingly until you're able to find just the right moment to retaliate.  It can be frustrating if you keep falling off the edge however since it takes a while to bring him down.\n\nOverall pretty disappointing but not the worst X game.","summary":"serious disappointment","unixReviewTime":1409702400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

N","reviewText":"After dropping the pathetic bombshell that was X6 back in 2001, Capcom finally decided it was time to take the X series to the next level. Unforunately, as if things weren't already bad enough for the series, we all know that Capcom failed to make this conversion as painless as possible, and fans had another half-baked game to add to their Mega Man X gaming collection.\n\nAt first glance, Mega Man X7 has eveything one would expect from a Mega Man title. The the cel-shaded graphics are pretty nice to look at, considering X fans are used to looking at 2D sprite graphics. Beyond it's graphical engine, however, X7 does almost everything humanly possible to ruin the rest of the experience for the gamer.\n\nTo start off, the load times are way too abundant. Considering  this isn't a first generation PSX2 title, and the fact that games like the PSX2 Final Fantasy's have better graphics and faster load times, this is just unexcusable (even if the load screens do act as continue points). Next is the horrendous english voice acting. Considering the fact Capcom conmpletely disrespected US gamers but not even bothering to add english voices to X6, this is a little more tollerable in my book (at least they tried - I guess).\n\nAnother gripe is we're still treated to the same still shots and text story scenes as in X5 and X6. I though the jump to a 32-bit system to a 128-bit system would actually mean something here, but no. You'll have to beat the game to see ending - the only VMF in the entire game, excluding the opening.\n\nGameplay is where Mega Man X7 commits the most serious of its crimes. The 2D sections of the game play well enough, even if the auto-aim is a bit glitchy at times. 3D sections don't even play half as well, as camera problems creep up continously, forcing players to make some jumps completely blind (don't get me started on having to rotate the camera in conjunction to shooting in some boss fights just to see your attacker...). Even worse is the mass of slowdown one will experence, espcially during the boss fights, were the game slows down to a crawl. Level designs are decent, but it is pretty sad considering one can find all the hidden power-ups without much exploration (I didn't even have to consult a guide - I found everything on the first playthough).\n\nMost Mega Man fans will probably buy Mega Man X7 reguardless of what I written above (I still bought it, and I knew what I was getting into). Still, I remember a time when you could say you had beaten all the Mega Man X games and you could say it with pride. Unfortunately, now all it means you have played four good games and four so-so games.","summary":"Messing with a proven formula, Capcom ends up in hot water","unixReviewTime":1101254400,"vote":"7","style":null,"image":null}

The seventh game in a seven part series.\nEver since Megaman X4 was released back in 1997, hardcore fans of the series were impatiently waiting for Capcom to follow up on its impressive streak of solid MMX games, I being one of those fans. It took them nearly four long years to finally make MMX5, and when they did, it received nothing but mixed reviews. While it still stayed tried and true to the classic 2D formula, there were a few changes that ended up bringing the game down, such as the lack of anime-cutscenes and a guiding feature that hindered more than helped the game. Despite these quibbles however, I felt that this game was needlessly bashed by other hardcore fans, so I stood up for it. Afterall it was still a fun game and it stuck tried and true to the classic gameplay. Same thing for MMX6, only this one got even more criticism by the die-hard fans. I personally thought X6 was a reasonable game, though the story was bad, but once again, it delivered in challenging old-school gameplay. As a hardcore fan who is open to most games, I am willing to defend X5 and X6 to the end. However, the same cannot be said about the new entry, X7. Read on and see why the negatives outweigh the positives:\nPOSITIVES\n-For the most part, THE GRAPHICS HERE ARE PRETTY GOOD. Bringing the game to the PS2 was an advantage here because it allowed the environments to be brought fully into the 3D realm with lots of detail. Not only the environments, but also the characters were animated fairly well too.\n-Contrary to the last couple of X games, X7 ACTUALLY SPORTS AN EXCELLENT ROCK SOUNDTRACK. Nothing real memorable, but the tunes do stay true to the earlier games.\n-I like the option of BEING ABLE TO SWITCH BETWEEN TWO CHARACTERS AT ANYTIME DURING A LEVEL. This helps when a certain part of a level is too difficult with one character, but the one has an easier time.\n-Though most of the voice acting isn't necessarily great, I thought that the voices for Zero and Signas were excellent. If you pay close attention, you can tell that the voice for Signas is the same as the voice of Alucard from Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night.\n-And on the bright side, X certainly doesn't sound like a girl like he did in X4.\n-Certain enemies you encounter will bring up old memories of the first few MMX games.\nNEGATIVES\n-Here is where the X7 comes crashing down: WHEN A MMX GAME IS NO LONGER CLASSIC 2D, THEN A MMX GAME HAS LOST ITS \"SOUL\". What I mean is, by moving the game to 3D, the game loses its feel that most people have come to love. I'm not against making 3D games at all, quite the opposite in fact. It's just that the MMX series was meant to be classic sidescroller gaming, and by taking that away, the MMX games are reduced to nothing more than a generic 3D shooter that already looks like so many other games. Besides, we already have a 3D MM series, and that's none other than Mega Man Legends. I appreciate Capcom for trying to add a little bit of new to the formula, but this has really gone too far.\n-Also, without the classic 2D formula, the level designs become drab, without excitement.\n-While there were some places where the camera switched to 2D sideview, in both modes THE CONTROLS ARE VERY SLUGGISH. This is probably what turned me off the most about X7. Remember how X and Zero had smooth controls in all the past games? Well, its mostly gone now. Having sluggish controls is a big nono when it comes to these games because the games are all about fast action, and the game becomes no fun to play when your controls aren't very responsive.\n-Unresponsive controls means the game is going to be very difficult to play, and not in a good way.\n-A MMX GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO UNLOCK X, THE _MAIN_ CHARACTER?? Utter Blasphemy.\n-What's the point of Axl? He may be an easy character to use, but he's just plain annoying. I cringe everytime he speaks.\n-Remember how in X6 how they thankfully gave you the option of listening or not listening to Alia's advice? WELL THEY SOMEHOW MESSED THAT UP HERE TOO! Everytime you get to certain points (which is like every few feet) Alia will whine at you to listen to her advice. This is almost as annoying as when you were FORCED to listen to her in X5.\n-Also, the dialogue moves very slowly and you are forced to sit through everything.\n-The story has gone so far off track that it's become difficult to follow. So Zero is still around even after X6 where he (*SPOILER ALERT*) put himself into a capsule pod to awaken in the future where the MM Zero games take place? His presence in X7 completely negates those two games, AND THEY ARE VERY GOOD MM GAMES TOO, unlike this one here.\n-Don't get me started on the bosses. It's been stated before but Capcom really has run out of ideas for bosses. An onion?? I won't even touch that one.\n-The gameplay can become very unbalanced at times. While Zero can storm levels, it's nearly impossible to use him on most bosses in the game, even the easy ones.\n-WHAT'S THE POINT IN PUTTING SIGMA IN THE GAME?? Is there some sort of rule where Sigma has to be the final boss in every X game, regardless of how he does\/doesn't tie in to the plot? He hasn't been an important storyline element at all since X5, where he was a BIG part of the plot. I just wish Capcom would surprise us a little in that area.\nWhile I do give Capcom props for trying to add new dimensions to the MMX series, it proved to be a vain attempt to get a new audience, and it ended up only making everyone yawn. Since it's a bad game overall, I'm giving it only 2 stars. 1 star is too low though because I only reserve that for absolutely terrible games. X7 is still somewhat playable. It's just not my cup of tea, and that's saying alot because I'm actually a lot more open to newer MM games than most of the diehard fans are. They will continue to put down X5 and X6 needlessly, but I believe X7 is where the low point really is. Once the game has lost all the aspects of the MMX series, it's over. X7 unfortunately demonstrates that fact. I hate to say it, but this is where Capcom should call it quits. IF YOU ARE A NEW FAN, AVOID. OTHERWISE THIS GAME IS A WEEKEND RENTAL AT BEST.","summary":"Nice try Capcom, but I was bitterly disappointed","unixReviewTime":1074729600,"vote":"19","style":null,"image":null}

It tries to improve upon the formula and that certainly isn't the best idea.  A new character is introduced but that can't save Mega Man X7 at all.\nThe 3-D graphics aren't that bad at all in this game. Surprisingly their pretty good.  We get to watch a 3D anime scene at the start and it's pretty cool.  But that's about as far as eye-candy goes. Without a doubt more animations and such could've been put into the graphics.\nI can't say much for the sound.  A lot of it is pretty bad and while it hits the action notes, it just doesn't work.  The voices (in english anyway) are very horrible.  The sound effects are cool though, but that doesn't mean the sound is all that great.\nThe gameplay almost saves this game and actually gets it the two stars it deserves.  The gameplay is simple, just like always.  When you select to go to a level you now get to choose two of three characters. Either X, Zero or the new character Axl.  You're allowed to switch between the two characters as you like. As you might have guessed, Zero is the strongest of the three and he uses a Z-Saber (Think of a lightsaber from Star Wars if this is your first Mega Man X game).  Axl is a new character who has the ability to float in the air if need be for a short while (like Peach in Super Mario Brothers 2).\nWhile the gameplay is good it is quite a difficult game, like many other Mega Man X games it takes time to get used to.\nThe story actually focuses around Zero and Axl.  There really is no real plot in Mega Man X7, it's the same old select between eight bosses until you get to that final encounter.  Short game as always.\nIt's about time a Mega Man game came to the PS2 but I certainly woudln't recommend you get this one.

The colorful environments, stimulating music, and inventive character design kept me interested even into recent years. After Megaman X4 however, Capcom has been getting sloppy with the series. The translation and overall production of X5 and X6 took a nose-dive, the music wasn't as inspired, and the level setup\/enemy design was poor. Sadly, Megaman X7 is even worse than those two games. The updated 3D graphics give the game a fresh facelift, but the hit detection, boss design, and story is just a garbled mess. The camera in the full 3D areas often obstructs the player's view, some of the minor enemies take way too many hits to defeat, and there isn't even a sound effect when you pick up items. In short, the whole production simply feels glitchy and incomplete. The new character Axl is no redeeming factor either...he's a whiny brat who is meant to appeal to today's overconfident youth. If a good Megaman game is what you want, get Megaman X4 for PS1 or one of the Megaman Zero games for Gameboy Advance instead.\nFirst the Street Fighter\/VS. series drops in quality, then the sequel to Devil May Cry turns out to be a dud, and now Megaman X7...what's going on, Capcom?","summary":"How could Capcom let this happen to the Megaman series?","unixReviewTime":1069200000,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

Some features were improved, others took a step backwards and the result is an average at best game that could have and should have been so much more.\nWe'll start with the gameplay. The computer is able to use this incredible little \"Hold\/Hook\" feature to get the puck from you at will. Last I checked Holding and Hooking were penalties, but the computer is hardly penalized for these infractions. Naturally you might think that turning around and hooking\/holding them would be successful, but don't worry, the computer is able to skate right through hooks and holds. This leads to many frustrating encounters as the computer effortlessly strips you of the puck while you have to bash a computer guy through the glass to get the puck from him.\nThe passing can also be frustrating, guys often cut or spontaneously change their direction after you fire off the pass. I thought I had finally got passing down, was getting 80-85% passing and then I was hit with a game in which I completed a whole 56% of passes. As far as I know I didn't change anything. The nature of the beast? At any rate, passing, while it isn't guarenteed anymore (that's good) is perhaps a bit too random now.\nThe camera angles are also rather poor. I don't know why EA messed with it's cameras, but for any of the vertical camera angles the \"up\" net and the area behind the \"up\" net is impossible to find the puck in.\nThe off-ice features are a mess as well. First of all, no more NHL Cards. OK, OK, so you never used them anyway right? But you could unlock stuff with certain cards and earning points to buy card packs was a nice extra element. Well all that is gone. Instead in NHL 2004 there is a menu option called \"Unlockables\". Oh, how original. I believe it is tied in with your EA Sports Bio and periodically it pops up and gives you a new unlockable. Exciting, isn't it?\nNow how about that new Dynasty mode you ask yourself? Well, it's a start at a good mode but is riddled with problems. First of all is this upgrade stuff. You get your team in a crippled state, their facilities are horrible and you have to use upgrades to get them to average and then beyond. Until you do that's a big ol -10 OV to your players. But every other GM faces this problem too, so the playing field is level ... everyone just plays with slow 70-75 OV players until they get their facilities up.\nOf course, that'll take about 35 more upgrade points than you start with, so you'll need 3500 exp points. That'd be 350 trades or 1750 wins. Win a Stanley Cup or two along the way and it's probably only 500 wins.\nThat's not the only problem either. Dynasty Mode conviently forgets to mention when players are injured and refuses to even give you an injury estimate. Perhaps this may be related to the medical upgrades, but I should still be able to know if he's in serious health trouble or not. The effect of back to back games on your players is also ridiculous, don't expect to win the back end of any back to backs: your players are literally pylons out there.\nThe big effort of NHL 2004 seemed to go into its Dynasty Mode. This means the other features are very bare bones and you really must use Dynasty Mode to get anything worthwhile out of the game. Unforetunately, while Dynasty Mode had some good ideas the execution wasn't there. And sadly the gameplay certainly isn't about to \"hook or hold\" you in where the features fail (haha haha ha ...)\nThe motto of NHL 2004: It had some good ideas, but the execution just wasn't there.","summary":"Another average at best EA hockey game","unixReviewTime":1064361600,"vote":"12","style":null,"image":null}

Naturally last year when Nintendo announced that they had revived this game (it was on N64 but got canceled) I was very excited. So it was with that excitement I proceded to my local Blockbuster the week of it's release to see just what the geniuses at Hal Labs had in store for me this time. Words can not express the disapointment I felt the first time I raced. I'd heard this game was simple but this is downright retarded. Memo to Hal: there are six other buttons on the controller for the reason that unless you're playing a minigame in Mario Party one button can't function as everything. In this game the A button does everything. It brakes, sucks in enemies, uses their powers, and when over a boost pad initiates it. Let me explain how this simply can not work. While attempting to catch up to the Kirby in first I sucked in an enemy. Problem is A is also the brake so I slowed down and was relegated to third place. Now when I used my bombs I was forced to brake again thus putting me in fourth! Are you seeing the picture now? But wait there's some bad icing to go on the stale cake. This game has nine tracks. Whoever let this game ship thinking nine tracks was enough needs to be fired and hit. Many people will tout this games 360 unlockables as a selling point but honestly they do a horrible job extending this games already short lifespan. This is due to the fact most are utterly pointless such as the soundcheck (which at this point shouldn't have to be unlocked anyway). Other than the initial time getting use to the controls this game is also pretty easy. Once for fun I started a race and just set the controller down watched since Kirby accelerates automatically (which by the is another horrible idea). I finished second. Finally the multiplayer in this game isn't even very good which is bad for a game in a genre where the lifespan of the game pretty much depends on multiplayer. Overall, I will buy this game but only to own Kirby's first (and hopefully not last) Gamecube outing. However this will be when I can pick it up for fifteen dollars at most.

While nintendo is not one of those develpers who make racing games, 3 will be coming out this year. F-Zero GX (great game), mario kart double dash (which is getting alot of hype) and kirby's air ride, a game that just doesn't seem like it actually came out of the nintendo camp. Like nintendo couldn't have possibly ok'd a game that uses one button. But they did and to tell you the truth this game has little going for it.\nThe game boasts of being a \"one button game\" which is basically saying we want to appeal to the younger crowd and get them involved in some of the older nintendo franchises. But after 2 days of renting the game my little brother was found playing the game, hands on the controller sleeping in front of the television set. And the 3rd day he was saying how he didn't like the game (and this is funny cause he's at that age where anything he watches that appeals to young audiances he will like no matter what - if its bad he'll like it, if its good he'll like it). This got me into playing the game. The game has terrible gameplay. Like I said before it's a one button game meaning it takes absolutley no skill to win, just knowing when to press the A button. If you know when to press A you can win. This means that I can play the game for years and years and my little brother can come up (after not playing the game in years) and whoop me cause he knew when to press A. And this doesn't just go for racing in multiplayer. In city mode you can pick up items and while picking up things (like the rocket launcher) if you pick up something it will begin a rapid fire of rockets giving you no control over where the rockets go. Why not use the Y button or the B button. This is just plain old silly, why cant you use the other 5 buttons on the GC controller to shoot a rocket, why? why? why?\nKirby's Air Ride does have a few things going for it. The graphics and the colors are nice and bright and the music is good but can get a little repetettive. Plus there are plenty of cool feaures ot unlock in one of the modes giving the game a decent amount of replay value. Something many kirby fans aren't used to (remember how quick it took to beat the last kirby game.)\nUnfortunatley kirby air ride is the first GC game to support the LAN support for a GC game.

I was very excited, having played mario golf on the N64, to have a similiar game in a handheld format. Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations.\nPros: great graphics, cool side games that help improve your skills, being able to build your skills through winning tournaments and the sound is decent. There's a storyline to follow: if you care about that sort of thing.\nCons: The AI cheats fairly early on. I'll give you an example: The third tourney is played on a desert course. The first hole is a 470+ par four. I get a birdie on the hole and when they go to the leader board I'm in 4th place! Two people are tied for first with -3! THREE UNDER??? AFTER ONE???? That means they both got a hole in one on a 470 yard hole. Now THAT'S cheap.\nAnother problem is dicey physics. Sometimes you'll get a ball to roll up on the green or stop one with backspin, but most of time the green appears to be made of concrete with balls bouncing yards into the air and shooting off the green at high speeds. The flight path of your ball shown by a glowing line that sometimes looks as though it's clear of obstacles but really isn't. You end up putting balls into trees, cacti etc. that look as if you should be clearing them. If a ball is close to the edge of a fairway or fringe you invariably are put in the rough. And the rough appears to be made of some hybrid of grass and superglue, a cheap way to make holes tougher. Then we'll move on to the course designs. Now I'm all for making golf games challenging but this is where the game really falls apart. Trees and cacti are simply put randomly in the middle of fairways with no thought towards realistic or asthetic course design, again, a cheap way to make holes tough. Then there are the \"hills\". What they actually are, are shelves or steppes that eat up ball momentum and fail to represent real world physics or course design. Not too mention they make the course look silly. Putting is random at best, you can't rotate the green to read it, the game doesn't give you any info other than distance to hole and those stupid arrows that affect the balls motion at seemingly random intervals. A big hill will certainly slow you down if you're putting up it, but won't neccesarily help with a downhill putt. You always need to putt farther than the distance the computer gives you.\nAll in all I was really disappointed. Maybe I'm expecting too much out of this game. I know it's not supposed to be a golf sim, it's an RPG. That's fine, I'm not opposed to adding a dimension to a game. However, if the basis of a game is golf, then it should play like a golf game, moreover, it should be a GOOD golf game. I'm not saying it should be Tiger Woods 2005, but games like Hot Shots and Swing Away do a fine job of incorporating stat building with a good arcade style of golf play.

{"overall":2,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"08 17, 2011","reviewerID":"AWAGSXM9CNZCC","asin":"B00009WDLD","reviewerName":"An Android Fan","reviewText":"Consider this a dual review; I'm reviewing both the original and the sequel here.\n\nMy first experience with Deus Ex was when my brother showed me a few minutes of the gameplay on his PC back in 2000. It wasn't too terribly far into the game but far enough that I had no clue what was going on story wise or what sort of gameplay mechanics it used. That was the seed that began it all, however.\n\nA few months after that I found a jewel case for about $20 in a used PC store. Figuring that I could spend $20 on worse things, I snatched it up and went back to my dorm. Took a bit to tweak the settings to balance visuals with framerate (the computer I owned at the time was ancient even then) but finally worked all of that out.\n\nAnd it didn't take too long before I realized why my brother liked the game so much.\n\nI'd played a few games that allowed for freedom of choice before, but not to the scale that was offered here, and certainly not one that had as much replay value. I couldn't even begin to imagine how many times I replayed a particular level, or the game from beginning to end, trying something else just to see how it'd play out, and it took many, many playthroughs before I finally could say I saw\/heard everything. Even on playthroughs where I already figured I must've seen\/heard everything, I still ended up uncovering something new.\n\nThe game had a stronger emphasis on the shooter aspect than sneaking\/hacking, but the general gaming atmosphere, and the expectations of the gaming audience at the time, were far different than it'd be today, so it shouldn't be too much of a surprise that shooting through the game was oftentimes the main path. There always was a stealth route available (apparently, even the most secure, heavily defended bases on the planet all have at least one air duct large enough for a man to crawl through - and they can crawl through completely silent at that!) but breaking stealth, accidentally or otherwise usually meant a fight until everything around you gathered flies. The fact that decisions in one level rarely impacted the game in the long term was disappointing, but it was more than fun enough to see everything it had to offer. In the end, the game was easily one of my favorite games and likely always will be.\n\nThen, about a year ago, I stumbled across a copy of the much less well received sequel, Deus Ex: Invisible War. By the time it originally came out, I was drifting away from PC gaming as a whole and didn't really bother to check into it before this. I knew that lots of people hated the game, but some enjoyed it, and I finally decided that there was only one way to find out which camp I belonged in.\n\nBy then I had a computer that was made several years after DE:IW came out, and was far more powerful than the recommended specs on the box.\n\nYet, somehow when the game began, I had to spend at least 15 minutes messing with the visual settings before finally having no choice but to scale everything - resolution, textures, the whole nine - down to the lowest levels. If I made one single setting go higher than the absolute lowest, it'd be a slideshow. Didn't matter which one, every single setting had to be at its lowest. Yet somehow everything at the lowest was smooth - there was no in-between. Not a great way to start things off, especially when you already have concerns about the game.\n\nAnd it only got worse from there.\n\nIt's already very hard to ignore the mechanical flaws this game has, such as the horrible voice acting from every major character who wasn't in the first game (and some who were) the clunky gameplay, the annoying side quests that I ended up just ignoring about half way in, the horribly washed out colors, goofy character animations, the tad bit TOO streamlined inventory and magic ammo pool from whence all weapons drew being examples just off the top of my head. These might - just MIGHT - be forgiven if the story and characters themselves are great. But these are also two areas where IW failed to deliver. There were zero - literally, zero - great plot twists. There is a plot twist towards the latter half of the game that changes how you view the factions, but even if the plot twist was mind-blowing and completely unpredictable, (it's not!) it doesn't hold any weight to the game, so replaying the game and knowing the truth doesn't really make a difference. The plot twist in this game doesn't quite hold the same impact as the original KOTOR when you discovered who Darth Revan was, or perhaps Andrew Ryan telling you to stop (and what he says after) in Bioshock, or when Harbinger said what would be his final two words to...somebody who's not Shepherd in Mass Effect 2, despite the fact that it looks like that's what the developers were striving for. It seems like they were trying to wow us with that plot twist, yet it just falls flat.\n\nThere's also no real sense of escalating tension between protagonist and antagonist(s) either. In the original, every step forward meant two steps back, as it should be. Here, there were multiple factions going head to head and trying to convince you to take their side, but there's no real reason to care about any one of them, and the fact that you could have actively worked against any one of them the entire game yet still be able to fulfill their agenda was disappointing. In one instance, this can even mean going so far as to kill a key member of the original game in cold blood. You could do that, and still work with that faction, as if nothing was wrong. No real consequence for your actions.\n\nSpeaking of factions, did anybody else's hand attach itself to forehead upon finding out that one of the factions is - I'm not making this up - the Templars? Oh, but it gets better! Despite being disbanded over 7 centuries ago, somehow the Templars manage to raise up a formidable army, in a horrible, global recession no less, complete with walking mechs, choppers, tanks, you name it. You also spend the majority of the game sneaking into, killing, destroying, disrupting and otherwise giving anything that is even remotely Templar a headache of titanic proportions. But towards the end of the game, that doesn't matter none! Nope! The grandmaster of the Templar order doesn't seem to care one bit that you've killed countless soldiers and cost him millions in equipment loss. He'll still let you work for him if you're so inclined! And unless I missed something, the game also didn't really explain how Chad went from peaceful protester to megalomaniacal, homicidal dictator who would stop at nothing for total control. He was easily as detestable as the grandmaster of the Templars, if not more so.\n\nThe endings do require that you commit to a certain path at the very end (but only the very end) and they divulge largely from each other - they are mutually exclusive. In the original, they're not really so exclusive, a fact that this game takes on, because the canon \"ending\" the sequel uses is a combination of all of them. That is to say, JC fulfills every ending, and the world is shaped by that. But despite being mutually exclusive and forcing a final commitment, they still disappoint.\n\nThe only real improvements this game had over the original are that unlike the first game, you can 1.) Play a male or female operative. 2.) You can't save, get a door code by paying somebody, reload the game and use the code without spending the money - this time, you have to have the code to open the door. 3.) Air ducts are also guarded this time. 4. There's an interactive AI who resembles a major pop star. In one exchange, you can reveal the actual pop star's manager doing a dirty deed and ask her what she'll do. Her response? \"Oh, tra la la...I'll probably just fire the b---h!\" That got a good laugh. 5.) And the last level in the game was a good choice, as it ties the storyline back to the original game.\n\nBut those are it. And those plusses do not even begin to compensate for IW's many and deep flaws. So, in the end, I have no choice but to side with the camp who loved the original but hated the sequel. Fortunately, Human Revolution proved to be just what the series needs to bring it back into the limelight, so hopefully we can all move forward and forget this awful game.\n\nDeus Ex: 9.5\/10\nInvisible War: 3.75\/10 (And I feel that I'm being generous with that score.)\nHuman Revolution: 8.5\/10","summary":"The game that nearly killed the franchise","unixReviewTime":1313539200,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

How did they go wrong with this?  They had the perfect blueprint from the original game and screwed it all up by dumbing the gameplay down for a simultaneous console release (even after Warren Spector said he wouldn't dumb down the gameplay).\n\nThe environments are much smaller this time around, damage system is lousy (at v. 1.0, a hit anywhere on an enemy did the same damage).\n\nMy biggest gripe is the original was a very realistic Scifi FPS with meticulous ammunition management and yet in the sequel we get universal ammo and weapons that don't even need to be reloaded.  It's like they're stepping backwards.\n\nAnother cruddy element is the idle stance the characters have.  It doesn't look natural.  Every character when idle stands like a 3D character that hasn't been rigged yet with their arms a foot from their sides.\n\nThe music was yet another step back for the series as well.  There were no memorable themes (aside from the title and opening movie) and they ditched dynamic music which I loved in the original game (when you snuck around unnoticed, one song played, and when you were in combat, another higher tempo and more action packed variation segued in).\n\nFinally, it's a minor element, but I also miss the camera bob from the original game.  It made the camera movement feel more natural and once again is a step backwards for the series.

It's quick to hop in to, doesn't have a whole lot of plot for you to forget (this was kind of a downpoint, but having played the game on and off over about 3 months it's become a good thing), and you can make accomplishments with about 10-15 minutes of gameplay (or even save during game in a pinch).  It's perfect for travelling.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and addictive.  It's been a while since I played the Playstation original, but the classes seem better and more balanced, and more meaningful when you combine abilities.  It's a great way to kill a half hour here and a half hour there.\n\nNow the things that drag it down.\n\nThe Law system is by far it's most annoying feature.  It's basically  a list of things you can't do in a particular battle.  There are two results to breaking said law: 1) for a minor transgression, you get a yellow card.  after the battle, it will do somethingbad to your character like lower stats, etc.  2) more severe violations of the law (usually KOing someone with the illegal move) will take you out of the battle and put you straight into prison.  The problem is that the yellow card doesn't effect your opponents, because what happens after the battle is irrelevant to them, and usually 2-3 enemies every battle have an ability that converts any severe violations into a yellow card, so they never get removed from battle.  In effect, the Law system is a restriction on you and no one else.  Also, if your main character ever gets a severe violation, it's game over for you.\n\nThe further into the game you get, the more annoying it gets to be because they become more general and more numerous.  You'll end up in battles where Swords, Fight (the basic attack command), and color magic (white, black, red, etc) are all forbidden.  Great, so you've got about 1 character that can do anything worthwhile, meanwhile the other team is all suited up perfectly to not have to deal with those laws.  Sometimes in a long drawnout battle you'll forget what the laws are and accidentally break one.  It sucks to get gameover just because after a 45 minute battle (because 90% of your moves are handicapped it gets hard to win quickly) you accidentally break some obscure law like attacking the same opponent twice in a row.\n\nWhich brings me to my next complaint.  Not all of the laws are clearly spelled out.  You'll remember what they are after the first time you break them, but knowing ahead of time is often not possible.  For instance: \"knightswords\" will be banned.  None of the offending weapons are labeled as such, so you don't get to know if you're going to break the law until you actually do.  Similarly: \"ganging up\" has something to do with multiple allies attacking the same enemy; hard not to do when it's the last enemy on the board.\n\nThe Judge who enforces these laws (one in every battle) also is sort of annoying himself.  He stands in the battlefield and takes a turn (and a space) like everyone else.  He takes his turn extremely slow though...just sitting there for 20-30 seconds at a time most often, and then moving somewhere or rearranging KOed bodies for some reason.  It breaks the momentum of the game.","summary":"Brilliant GBA game laid low by annoying \"features\".","unixReviewTime":1163376000,"vote":"10","style":null,"image":null}

Each one has been different and had it's own good points and bad points.  As for FF Tactics Advanced, the bad far outweigh the good.  Let me tell you the good points first.\n1. It's on GBA, meaning it's portable and that you can play it anywhere at anytime.\n2. Player's are able to change jobs as in the original FF Tactics.\n3.  The graphics are pretty decent for a GBA game.\nNow for the bad\n1.  The Story - the story for FFTA has to be the most thoughtless and simple ones for any FF game to date.  Your character is warped into an alternate dimension where the Final Fantasy video game becomes real.  Your objective now is to find a way back home (how creative).  You join a clan of other characters and fight with other random clans throughout the game.  You advance the plot by completing various missions.  You eventually have to fight your friends from the real world who don't want to go home and convince them to go back with you.  You can basically know the whole lame story of this game before you even get halfway through the game.  I won't spoil the ending for those of you who haven't played the game (even though there's not much to spoil).\n2. Laws - On FFTA the game has a set number of laws in each location and a judge watching the battle to make sure no one breaks them.  At times you can cleverly use these laws to bind your enemies from doing certain things.  However, later on in the game the game starts placing 3 laws in effect all at once.  This slows down the battles greatly and sometimes the 3 laws could be barring you from healing, using magic, or even using the fight command itself!  Sometimes they even barred me from doing dmg to animals in a battle where I was fighting 5 animals.  These laws end up being more annoying than helpful especially if you're like me and want to build characters to their max lvs and stats.\n3.  Lack of Sidequests - This game has a huge lack of sidequests or other alternate things to do in the game.  You can accept extra missions from the Pubs but half of them don't even allow you to fight, but rather dispatch a clan member to complete the mission for a certain amount of time.  The extra missions where you can actually fight are often unrewarding and a waste of time.  This game lacks a Dungeon or bonus area where enemies are stronger than the final boss like in the other FF titles (ie. Deep Dungeon of FFT, Via Infinito of FFX-2, Research Cen. FF8, etc.)\n4. Sound - If you've played any FF titles before then I'm sure you know what I mean when I say that the music on this game is weak.  The tunes on the other games were so good that you would go to some areas just to hear the music and would later find yourself humming the tunes.  However, on this game that isn't the case.\n5. Difficulty - Square usually tries to balance the FF games.  Not make them to hard but then again not to easy either.  This one falls in the category with the \"kiddie game stigma\" that plagues Nintendo today.  The game is far too easy for anyone who's played and beaten the other FF titles.  They made this one in order to ensure that all 6-14yr olds would be able to beat this game.\nOverall I wouldn't recommend this game to a normal RPG fan.  Get this one ONLY if you feel the need to have every Final Fantasy game in your collection or if you're not bothered by the huge number of flaws in this game (I would have listed more if I had more space).","summary":"Disappointing coming from a great company like Square\/Enix","unixReviewTime":1076544000,"vote":"10","style":null,"image":null}

It is a very different, and in my opinion, annoying at times.\n  The main character is a very young child, which goes along with the new trend of games (younger and younger).  The plot is shallow and easy to follow [I am halfway through the game].  There are many more job classes, however, most have the same abilities of each other, just with different names.  Skills are learned like in FF9; through equiped items.  The game is far too easy for any skilled player.  It allows 6 team members in a battle, but the battles can be won with only 2 [without building levels in random battles].  The only difficulty comes from 'Laws' governing your battles.  Because if you don't pay attention, your players can get arrested.  The 'Laws' are an original idea, however, and help make the game interesting.\n  Eventually, certain races can summon special monsters, which can kill bosses instantly.  No effort, no fun.\n  My main complaint is the characters.  There is no way to make them original.  You CANNOT name them.  Certain claases are only available to certain races.  Humans' genders change with job changes [Karl,my Fighter, switches to paladin.  His face changes to a female look with long hair, makeup, and earrings. Same with Illusionist and white mage].  Also since certain jobs are for certain races, everyone learns everything quickly and they all become too similar.  There are also just a handfull of secret players.\n  I do like some things, though.  The map placement is cool, and I like the Blue and Red mages.  The graphics rock, too.  Play control is excellent, and you can take back all of your moves.  'Life' is 100% always, and 'Item' is automatic.\n  OVERALL, It's Fianl Fantasy 9 set to Final Fantasy Tactics.

NONE.  i don't care what reviews say or what anyone else says, you have NONE.  at all times, you must meet the demands of two different panels, the needs panel and the aspirations panel (and avoid fears).  what does this mean?  AT ALL TIMES YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, BECAUSE THE COMPUTER IS TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO AT ALL TIMES.  this is entertainment?  no.  it's no different than some guy telling you \"ring this bell\" over and over, and you have to do it to win a game that has no reward.\n\nnow, i knew the needs panel was going to be a factor, and it's (surprisingly) fun.  who knew it could be fun to do the dishes, or lay on the couch?  this is where the sims tricks you.  then as you get addicted, you realize, for one thing, YOU HAVE NOOOOO free time.  and i mean none.  AT ALL TIMES you will HAVE to do the dishes, take out the trash, pay bills, or whatever.  i mean literally at ALL times, because this game is that demanding.  your levels are constantly falling and you're constantly trying to keep them at a reasonable or better level.  it's work, work, work.  also the \"free will\" option is an absolute joke.  if you use the free will option, your sim will be in big trouble.  let's say you have 4 things to do:  take out the trash, take a shower, cook a pop-tart and put it in the trash.  on free will, your sim might do 2 of those things and then be completely helpless.  the name of the sims 2 should be MICRO-MANAGEMENT TO THE MAX.\n\ni'm not saying there aren't great things about the sims 2.  it's a very different idea (at least it seems so at first), the graphics, details, even the music playing on the sims' radios is copmletely amazing and creative.  but considering they failed on the most fundamental level of video games (to give you some control over the game, and make the game your own) makes this game a true failure.  after all, isn't that the whole point of the sims??  to make something of your own?  to have free will???  if you don't believe me, notice that all the online reviews of the sims 2 were written by reviewers who didn't play it for very long.  same thing for amazon.  one amazon reviewer wrote she was hooked on the sims 2 for a month and then got sick of it.  that's about what happened to me.  i was hooked on it until i realized what i was doing.  now i don't even want to look at this stupid game.  so expect to enjoy it for a week or so, and then be bored to tears.  you've been warned.\n\np.s. i also had some other problems.  you start the game, and there are 3 different neighborhoods with different houses.  this was great, until i realized there's no way to re-play these families, so once you mess with them even a little bit, your gameplay is saved and irreversible.  also i have no interest in building a new house of my own or whatever, so this seemed even more stupid to me.  also i ran across a couple of bugs.  one ruined a whole family for me- a baby fell on the floor, and a bug made it where i couldn't pick the baby up no matter what.  this made the mother so upset, she couldn't do anything.  so i had to not play that family at all.  they could have at least included more families or a way to re-play the pre-set families.","summary":"the best horrible game ever made.","unixReviewTime":1120953600,"vote":"10","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

And maybe do some of the many \"options\" available while you're at it. But the reason I liked this game is the option to import MP3's and WMA's onto the Xbox. Unfortunately, except for the importer, this game is a heedlessly made abnormality trying to make it on the karaoke scene. Be Warned: This game is NOTHING like the hit Karaoke Revolution on the PS2. In fact, it is not even close to it at all. Sadly, I am too late with this warning for consumers. So many of you are most likely disappointed with this game. But with the cheap genius that is Microsoft, they took out a page from a little game called Madden 2002. Where EA made very few changes to the game at all, yet they just put on the Madden trademark and they had turned trash into gold. Just substitute few changes to Windows-style eye candy and Madden trademark with an MP3 Importer, and you have a match made in heaven! And even worse than this is that people have bought this game and they will continue to buy this game only for the Importer. It is Sheer Madness!!!!\n\nPros: 1. The MP3 Importer (Finally fixes the infamous unreadable CD-RW problem on the Xbox)\n\n2. Windows-Style Eye Candy (SO distracted)\n\nCons: 1. Windows-Style Eye Candy (SO hypnotizing)\n\n2. Actual songs, but very cheesy versions of them (If we wanted this, we'd torture ourselves with Kidz Bop!!!)\n\n3. Very Limited Video making capabilities.\n\n4. Songs downloadable for $5 (like any poor sap would download them anyway?)\n\n5. WIll cost more money for Peripherals for Importing (you first have to download the PC exporter off the internet (free), but the System link cable for connecting the two will cost you $30!)\n\n6. And the worst sin of all for a Karaoke game: You can barely hear yourself out of the speakers!!!!!! Even with the mic set on the highest volume you still can barely hear yourself over the voices (hey, maybe they were saving the family members from certain torture) But as I said, Sheer Madness!!!!!\n\nFinal Verdict: The only reason you are ever going to come along this game in the future is for the MP3 importer and only for the MP3 Importer. This is NOT a party tool, that Abominaton that is named Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing is a better party tool than this (Okay, maybe i'm stretching it way too far, let's just leave it at Halo) But yes, If you have MP3's and you want to put them on the Xbox, this is your only option (makes me sad to say that.)","summary":"MP3 Importer Cloaked by Worthless Trash of a game.","unixReviewTime":1092873600,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

Wheeler","reviewText":"Well other than the console fanboys and paid reviews I didn't see much here so I'll write a real review. Basically EA took the same horribly crippled SSX engine and pasted in 'new' game-play. Much the way the tonyhawk line went, SSX 3 is just a more complex (not to be confused with sophisticated) version of the last game with even more bugs and play issues. In the first two games these flaws weren't enough to keep me from playing the game, but SSX 3 is so horrendously awful, that I just can't play it for more than a few minutes before It disgusts me. I'm not in the know about the stability on other console versions, but the Game-Cube version has crashed on me at least a dozen times in about seven hours of on and off game-play, more than the first two games combined over a period of months ( none of my other games have crashed except Resident Evil 1). The controller is often ignored during complex tricks (I've tried three controllers). The boost is little more than a colored streak with no effect on speed or tricks, and the tricks are outright boring since every character has the exact same tricks. You'll find that the whole mountain theme is just a new way to layout most of the same tracks from the first two games (there's no freedom to go wherever you want on the mountain even after you've unlocked everything, it's just a big track), and that you absolutely have to do linked combos to pass certain events. The problem with combos is that the default controller layout is virtually useless (you find out after using it for a while) and that there are so many ignored key presses that it's almost impossible to do a good combo or even a lot of tricks. The linking move for a combo is moronic (yet it's a copy from a competing poorly made game) and keeps you from controlling direction and speed. The different players are now a bunch of huge footed drab clones, but there's a new feature where you can dress your player. Unfortunately I didn't get SSX 3 to play dress-up, so it absolutely worthless, even changing your board has no effect whatsoever. The player characters have absolutely no personality unlike the earlier games. The tracks have even less. There are essentially five tracks that are modified to look different. The high scoring trickies are gone, there's almost no reason to do trickies in this game (the call them ubers and super ubers now, more complexity that doesn't enhance game-play in any way) and are 'uber' boring. Short cuts are there but you have to follow them strictly, there is almost no exploration like SSX tricky. Lastly I'd like to talk about the sound. The 'DJ' is so mind numbingly stupid, and the music so forgettable, that I can't imagine a reason to play it with any. Even with the music off, you'll hear your player character saying some of the stupidest things. Oh, and for those that played tricky and maxed out every player in gold, it's impossible in this game. Players good at tricks can never win a race against speed characters. Talk about lame, SSX 3 fits that bill.","summary":"Not even worth renting.

Those turn based top-down view rpgs on the Sega Mega Drive with cool characters, heaps of cool magic and detailed combat animations?\n\nWell those were classic sega games that came out a full DECADE ago. Compared to those strategy rpgs of yore, Fire Emblem (this the 7th in the series) makes NO PROGRESS WHATSOEVER.\n\nIt has lacklustre character designs, an overly wordy plot, a simplistic and boring combat system, a lack of difficulty and an annoying \"support\" feature which is somehow the developers attempt at adding replay value to this game.\n\nOverall, to the utter newbie whose only prior experience with these kind of games was with Advance Wars(which is arguably a better game than this one), Fire Emblem might seem like a solid choice. I agree, it IS a solid choice. It is also, however, a throwback of a game. A disappointing retread of gameplay that has been done bigger and better(on lower end systems I might add).\n\nHow to begin? I will make a short comparison between this game and Shining Force II, which many of you have already played. Let me remind you that:\n\n*SFII had more exciting animations. In Fire Emblem, most of the art went to the character portraits. When it comes to the top-down graphics in battle, as well as the battle animations themselves, this game looks extremely poor for a GBA game.\n\n*SFII had more varied character designs.  FE's characters might look \"pretty\", but are pretty much all same-ish anime fare, color-coded hair and all.\n\n*SFII had HEAPS more: weapons, armours, spells, items. It was much more varied. Compared to this, all FE has going for it is a nice little \"weapon triangle\" system and your token herbs and potions. Not very exciting. In SFII you could cast spells like gigantic lightning storms which affect entire areas. In FE the magic works just like a weapon. You attack one square at a time. BO-Ring.\n\n*SFII had BETWEEN-COMBAT exploration. In FE, it's pretty much battle after battle. Consequently the plot is FORCED to be told in huge CHUNKS pre and post-battle. Not very immersive.\n\n*SFII was fun and worth replaying. Just go try it. In FE however, any semblance of replayability is in the form of placing different units next to each other and wait turn after turn in hope of getting new support combos. Wheee.\n\nIt seems abit ridiculous for me to compare this hand-held game with a console game, but bear in mind that the console game in question came out more than 10 years before this. The game boy advance is both graphically and performance wise better than the Mega Drive in every respect. Why can't Intelligent Sys. make a game that fully utilises its potential?","summary":"Yawn.

This is quite possibly the worst game I have played in quite some time, and definitely the ONLY one I have EVER played where the best boss strategy was--wait for it--standing directly in front of the boss and mashing the \"A\" button. I mashed my way through 5 hours of this game, people, and I even beat one of the bosses while eating a sandwich and not fully turning back toward the screen until I heard the myrrh tree music. Make no mistake, this is no incredible feat on my part: this game is really that stupid.\n\nIn addition to the incredibly low level of challenge (god, was this game marketed for 10-year-olds? Then you shouldn't have put the FF title on it, Nintendo\/SE!), I haven't seen a game this repetitive since Pacman. You heard me. It's as repetitive as an arcade game - only it was RELEASED IN 2004. This is truly a development that should put Square Enix to shame. All you do, per level, is wheel around in your crystal caravan, watching 10-second cutscenes at random, and fight your way through three levels (of your choice) til you fill your chalice with myrrh. W.O.W. Each level honestly takes fewer than 10 minutes, so you will probably complete a chapter in all of 30. What do you do for the next chapter, you ask? Does the plot advance? The answer is NO. You do the SAME DARN THING. AGAIN. After a few chapters pass, you even have the option of going back to the levels you have already visited. Gosh. What an EXCITING idea.\n\nThe ONLY cool things about this game--and believe me, I really mean this part--are graphics, which are beautiful, and character customization, though that is of course minimal. But compared to the rest of the game, I don't know, I guess I'll take anything.\n\nYet another complaint of mine is the rotating camera angle. For GOOD games, this isn't a problem, and your typical gamer would be hard put to find a situation in which it was actually a bad thing. But in FFCC, unlike most [good] RPGs, the game is MAPLESS - so don't you dare wander around in a town you aren't familiar with, or else you'll be running in circles forever due to the rotating camera that makes it impossible to tell which way you just came from--because you are -always- facing a different direction. I'm sure I've actually spent longer wandering stupidly in pointless towns where the townsfolk tell you parts of a story you aren't privy to than I've spent fighting bosses. Navigating was certainly more DIFFICULT, that's for sure.\n\nIn closing, the only reason I still own this game is because the store I purchased it from went out of business and I can no longer return it. Today, however, following this review, I will put this p.o.s. to rest underneath my massive pile of well-developed PS2 RPG's and forget it ever existed.","summary":"You may say to yourself, \"Wow, that's a good deal.

They have earned the title of delivering the most elite fighting games ever.  So its not hard to be a little freaked out when they unleash a game like Kill. Switch.  If you asked me, I'd say that they derived the idea from their lackluster, action game Dead to Rights.  Neither impressive or a must-have title, Kill. Switch sadly shares a similar fate.  The game does in fact fume out a bag of potential, but what it lacks has transformed itself into grave issues that scatter in it.  Gamers may in turn be soured by having lost their money, when they could have purchased another game at the same price tag.\nKill. Switch looks as if it were inspired by Metal Gear and other countless games that follow Snake Pilsken's trend.  Not to mention a lot of mindless, senseless, kill-anything-that-moves gameplay.  We live in a reality where we are told to be the \"good guys,\" and consequentially, it was a pleasant surprise to take the role of a super solider being controlled by a man plotting utter ruination of the world.  He wants all countries warring with each other, to inspire fingers of the world to press the kaboom button.  That's where disappointment reigns, Namco does not amplify the story so the player can be as engrossed as it sounds.  Nor does he even care about the character he mans.  Instead he is forced to do the game's ultimate bidding; to gun and gun because it's filthy fun.\nThe action consists of a third person and if desired, first person, view to get into the gun fest.  Basically you run into every level and spray bullets at enemy targets.  The mission layouts don't really augment your experience or juice up imaginations.  Most objectives, varied in each mission, simply has the player reach the end of the stage and perform redundant things such as planting explosives.  Extremely feather-light on the difficulty aspect, Kill. Switch's trademark relies on its blind fire concept.  Its sure seemed like it would push the fun factor, but how can it when its utterly useless?  Blind fire rarely ever hits the target while the player shields himself behind cover and throws away streams of bullets.  The player can just easily rush his assailants with an arsenal of weapons.  Forced to find cover when pitted with an excess of enemy soldiers, the game does emanate a sense of entertainment by the unmotivated yet nonstop action.  Kill. Switch's combat is startlingly fast.\nWhat really has me vexed is Namco filling the game with excellent and running-silky-smooth graphics.  I mean why waste all  of that effort for a mediocre, run and gun game?  The lighting effects are solidly done with awesome shadow effects.  The models are boosted all around in a nice myriad of fluid textures.  Vividly bright, the sight of breaking windows and swirling, sandy air helped me get into the combat.  The music is downright unremarkable with retro, poppy, techno sounds that seem to sloppily bounce.\nThere is this gut feeling that Namco could have gone somewhere special with the game and make it deeply engaging.  I`m tired of playing as the blonde, blue-eyed hero in videogames.  I want to be an entity of villainy architect, set out to destroy what the \"good\" cling onto.  Namco let the opportunity slip away by spoon-feeing players with a boring turn of events.  They have drowned players by keeping the game abruptly concluded with no supplemental material.  Aside from that the gameplay keeps the game worth getting into, no matter if its only a weekend or two.  Kill. Switch is not worth the price of ownership, for it needs more than little touches here and there, it calls for an invasion of them.","summary":"Not Worth  the Price of Ownership but an Upright Rental","unixReviewTime":1070236800,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

To say that this game is a disappointment would be like calling a screwdriver driven into my ear a \"head-ache\". Don't fork out your money for this one, unless you've rented it first and actually enjoyed playing it.\nThe graphics are better than the last Wrestlemania game, but the controls are just as frustrating. Even when you put a finishing move on an opponent, it seems like too often they pop right up and knock you off of your ladder or cage or kick out of a three count. And if you find yourself in a triple threat or fatal fourway match? Frustration! You'll be trying so hard to face the right guy, that by the time you do, another opponent will come from behind and put a move on you. Ugh!\nThere is no elimination chamber match. Don't buy this game thinking this is an option. Pretty much, it has all the same matches that were on the last Wrestlemania game. The story-mode is a load of poop. You go through a bunch of street-fights such as a construction sight and get double or tripled-teamed. All the story mode is good for is getting you to curse in anger.\nIn short, I encourage you to rent this game. If you have a Gamecube and like wrestling games, try Def Jam Vendetta.

The main character moves with ease and his moves are complex. There's an expansive list of upgrades, items, and abilities, all great things for a Castlevania title. However, this game's perfect character interface is where the \"good\" ends, for me.\n\nThe world starts off good enough, great even. At least when you step out of the forest and beyond the Castle's first few rooms and into the first (of five) world(s) of the game. Soon, you realize that the developers were rushed to complete a game for Konami. The rooms and hallways, you'll notice within the first hour, have been 'cut and pasted' throughout the entirety of the game's 5 levels. The skins of the rooms might look different (a little), but you'll see the similarities, unless, of course, you are blind, that is.\n\nThe music is great, also, at first, anyway. The soundtrack when first entering the Castle is quiet, creepy, and atmospheric. As you continue onward, it gets better...for the first floor of the first level. Then, well...the soundtrack becomes a bouncy and annoying blend of club music and gothic-not a good mix, in my opinion, at least not to the extent that this soundtrack took it. The music was way too active and obnoxious for the lack of action that is really going on on the screen in front of you. That said, the first few tracks in the game are some of the best in the series.\n\nThe bosses are WAY too easy. The puzzles are WAY too simplistic. And eventually you find yourself wishing the game would have simply been made with 3D graphics and 2D level design (why not!?) Castlevania is, to me, a Platforming Action RPG. Lament of Innocence has a few moments of platforming throwbacks, but they're ruined by the game's unmovable camera. This game pretty much relies upon its stationary camera angle, because if you were allowed to move it, you'd be able to see all of the games \"hidden\" items plain as day: that's bad game design, if you ask me....\n\nIt's sad to say it, but as hard as I tried and wanted (believe me, I was pumped to play this game again) it to be a great CV game, it simply is not great. It's better all other 3D Castlevania games, however, Lords of Shadow included. But that's not saying much, being that game was a mediocre ripoff blending of God of War and Shadow of the Colossus.\n\nI wish there could be a great 3D Castlevania, but until they keep the simple things in the game that make Castlevania Castlevania intact, they'll fail over and over again.","summary":"Could Have Been Great...but","unixReviewTime":1357603200,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

The graphics are just pretty much like the Dreamcasts'.  There is no real improvment, which is disapointing since the PS2 has much better hardware and could have pulled off some pretty neat things.  They could have at least added a new city or something.  What is also lagging is a multiplayer.  Then the game would get interesting.  It's not really fun watching SOMEONE ELSE play.  The sound is great but for some reason, the people you pick up have more of a vocabulary than the drivers, which kind of ... since your driver can' defend himself when the people verbally attack him\/her when they say \"YOU...\" or something like that.  The control is a little slugish and you'll be slamming into walls and buildings at first. But I have to admit, this game is addicting, just not that addicting.

Even though this may somewhat increase the stats of the next monster, you literally take two good digimon and sacrifice them for one that you may not even like.  But that's the way the game flows.  One of personal favorite things to do (as it is in pokemon) I love to befriend new digimon, which can be hella rewarding especially with a certain digimon which (gasp!) is an Ultimate form of some digimon we all know and love! :o\nMy overall impression is that while you may not be feeding monsters, you sacrifice them to start to level 15 monsters (or higher) only to get to a level 1 monster that has the ability to level up.  Ugh...I just hate that process.\nAnother thing visually is not the so much the monsters as it is the dungeons.  Believe it or not all the dungeons are the exactly same shape, size and color; the only difference being some have traps, others can be long as hell, and usually there's only one track for each one.\nTalk about repetitive.

Later on in the game, there is little to NO health or armor, whereas in the beginning of the game it was littered everywhere. I found myself having an abundance of health items left lying around when they did appear, but during the battles with the \"mercs\" lo' and behold health and armor weren't too abundant, which made for some numerous and very frustrating deaths and load sessions.\n\nMy friends raved about this game back in the day, so I picked it up a couple of years ago expecting something great. In fact, they still tell me it's a great game. I wonder which game they were playing? NO WAY, could it have been this one. I am about 5 minutes from the final boss in this game and I'm going to find the ending to watch online, because I can't suffer through anymore mediocrity and cheap deaths.

I had such high hopes in the beginning.  It was as good as all the reviews said, reasonable graphics, good controls, fun weapons, OK story, and even though the terrain damage is only a gimmick (and one quickly forgotten) it was nice to see from time to time.  A fun game.  It also has great configuration options, letting you remap buttons and play with either normal or inverted y-axis; this is a deal breaker in a game as far as I'm concerned.  I cannot play a game where up moves you down and down moves you up.\n\nAnd then, the mercenaries come and the rail gun manages to nearly ruin the game.  Whoever decided to add it is almost wholly responsible for turning the last half of the game into nothing more than a frustrating series of saves and loads.\n\nAllow me to explain.  See the rail gun sounds like a great idea.  It can kill in one shot and it has an infrared scope that allows you to see enemies through doors, thin walls, etc.  Seems like a great cheap weapon to give people so if the game gets too tough they can rely on that crutch.  However, the problem is that the mercenaries can use them too.  They will wait behind things and blast you because you have to move forward.  More than one of them will sometimes have this gun at the same time.  They will sit there and kill you instantly, forcing you to reload just to get a crack at them again.  The *only* way to get past some of these scenarios is *if* the mercenary misses!  Because of where I saved, I had to play one segment ten times and 8 of those were due to impossible to avoid rail gun hits.  That's just unacceptable; I hate cheap deaths.\n\nWhile the first part of the game is truly great, the second half of this game has you spending 30 seconds saving your game after every minor battle and then watching the reload screen for 30 seconds after you periodically die an unavoidable death.  If you can't put up with this scenario, avoid this game.  Otherwise, it really is a decent title.  Without the rail gun, the game is easily a 4 or maybe 5 star.","summary":"Come to Mars, View a Load Screen","unixReviewTime":1248998400,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

The more I got into the game the stronger the sense until it struck me that 'Red Faction' borrows strongly from the PC first-person shooter of the year 'Half-Life.' Of course the later is a far superior title even though it was released more than 2 years ago.\n  Something about 'Red Faction's execution feels slightly lacking. I don't know if it's the boring enemy design, the inconsistent AI or the somewhat uninspired weaponry. I desperately wanted the game to throw a curve ball my way but instead it kept plugging along in a predictable manor, once and a while exploiting it's lone innovative features of blowing holes in walls and driving numerous vehicles.\n I really want to discuss the AI. At times it can be incredibly intuitive and puts up a decent fight but most of the time it jogs in circles and then runs away. It's annoying how almost every enemy says 'Don't shoot! I am unarmed!' even though they are holding a gun and most of the time shooting you as they say it. Plus their 'threat\/taunt' phrases are totally repetitive and overused. Specking of repetitive, for a good part of the game all enemys's look the same, blue palette swaps of yourself. It gets boring shooting the same people, that are saying the same things and reacting the same way.\n The AI for everything else (red miners, scientists) is terrible. I cannot tell you how many times a fellow miner said 'Follow me this way and I'll show you the way out!' only to run spastically away from me and into a guard that kills them. Almost every time.\n The general atmosphere of the game is effective but very similar that of 'Half-Life.' The mood is tense but exhilarating. Yet 'Red Faction' doesn't have the incredibly unnerving calm 'Half-Life' has before you are suddenly attacked.\n The graphics are amazing, and the game moves at an incredible 60 FPS but dives on occasion. Explosion effects range from incredible (blowing holes in wall with rocket launcher) to sub-par (destroying a huge tank only to get a pathetic ball of fire). Lighting is consistent and effective. Character models are average, except for facial build\/animation, which is lacking.\n The multiplayer is no Golden Eye. The lack of features makes it's novelty die fast. If only Sony would get their internet multiplayer off the ground. This game could have benefited from an insane online deathmatches. Especially if they found a way to incorporate the vehicles. Though right now this is largely a single player game, the multiplayer feels too half-baked.\n The reason this game is so well received is due to the fact that it rips great features from great FSP titles (HALF-LIFE, Golden Eye, Perfect Dark) and roles it all into one neat package. Yes, blowing up walls is fun, but hardly enough to call this title original.","summary":"Been There, Done That","unixReviewTime":995068800,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

After months of this game being pushed off further and further, when it finally arrived on store shelves, I was a bit hesitant on picking it up.  THQ tends to come up with a great idea and then makes a mistake in the implementation, such cases being the Game Boy Advance game GT Advance and the Playstation and Dreamcast game Evil Dead.  The idea of blowing through walls with a bazooka sounded great, but it had to be seen to believed.\nOverall, the game is average.  The selection of weapons is interesting, and the enemies are your usual range of foot soldier to highly armored gunner.  Nothing spectacular there.  The level design is pretty unique, and once you get deeper into the game, gets quite varied in textures and feel.\nAs a savior to the game, the demolition ability is amazing.  With a rocket launcher, you can punch through walls, allowing you to get to other areas or get a sneak surprise on your enemy.  This is especially well done in the multiplayer levels,  but in story mode, there aren't many walls you can punch a hole through, and the availability of the gun's ammo is few and far between.  The other downfall to the ability to knock through a wall is that it wasn't too often that you came across a strategic time to use it.  Near the beginning there is a chance to knock out a bridge so a convoy of soldiers and a tank.  It looks really well done, and gets the player excited about the capabilities, and then the game goes on to deliver nothing more than blowing up guys through walls.  And even that is few and far between.\nOverall, the game is addictive and runs at a good and steady 60 or so frames per second, and the multiplayer mode can be quite addictive.  I think with a little more thought and a better plot, a game in the future could use the Geo Mod technology to make an incredibly immersive environment that Red Faction failed to do.","summary":"Big New Idea for the First Person Shooter Genre","unixReviewTime":994118400,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

I don't have the GBA version, but I do have the PC version which is EXACTLY the same.  First off, I recommend only people who have never played this game before to purchase it.\nAs far as the actual gameplay goes, Rayman is a mixed bag.  Rayman earns his moves Banjo-Kazooie style from a fairy and runs, jumps, and later, swings and glides, throughout MANY levels.  The variety apparent in the levels is sometimes great. You'll turn tiny to fit through gaps or, using your spinning hair as blades, cut ropes attached to giant stones and a huge stone slap while dodging obstacles to prevent yourself from drowning in the water below (one of the game's most intense scenarios). But alas, this is where the problem in the game lies.  This game is VERY, VERY DIFFICULT. It will take countless tries to get past certain levels.  This wouldn't normally be so bad. The catch is you have a limited number of continues to get through the game, resulting in only about a total of 50 tries.  This problem will not seem apparent in the first stages, but 75% of the game will frustrate even seasoned gamers, and INFURIATE anyone below a good skill level.\nThankfully, the rest of Rayman is a joy to play.  Aside from polygon powerhouses such as Iridon 3D and Tony Hawk 2, you won't be seeing better graphics on the GBA thus far.  The music is surprisingly good also.  And the huge, hulking bosses are a great diversion from the regular game, as are Mr. Hat's various minigames. If you feel the hunger for some platforming action, Castlevania is the way to go.  If you're not into that series, get this.  But be warned - if anger management classes aren't up your alley, or you're getting this for a kid as their first game - get Mario Bros. Advance instead.","summary":"Be Wary of Rayman...","unixReviewTime":993340800,"vote":"8","style":null,"image":null}

And as I thought, \"Half-life: Blue Shift,\" did not disappoint in terms of graphics, gameplay, excitement and fun. BUT the problem is that you can finish this Expansion in 5 hours on the Difficult setting! Now I live in South Africa and I payed R250 (that's about $42) for it. Then I discovered why it was\/is so expensive: 1) it includes the retail version of \"Opposing Force,\" and 2) the Half-Life High-Definition pack. So of course I went and played the entire series with the new H.D pack and it was great! So I suppose if you were buying \"Blue Shift\" by itself it wouldn't be worth it. BUT (again) I already had the retail version of \"Opposing Force,\" and the return offer for \"Opposing Force\" was only open to Canada and the U.S.A. SO bummer for me for not being in the northern hemisphere YET AGAIN! Well, all that aside, here's my take on \"Blue Shift.\"\n\nIn this Expansion pack you assume the role of Barney Calhoun, a Security Guard at Black Mesa. Just like Gordon Freeman, you start your day normally with the usual drudge of the auto-tram and suiting up. However, Barney and the entire Black Mesa facility are soon inexplicably thrown into a world of blood-thirsty aliens and merciless and unforgiving soldiers. And of course the only way out is to fight - you can't really fault the storyline as it follows the same type of adventure as the previous 2 installments. And there are new places to explore and different objectives (in some instances), so I guess that \"Blue Shift,\" gets a 9\/10 for the story etc.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, \"Blue Shift\" is actually very easy. Even on the hardest setting it's a cakewalk, and for seasoned F.P.S players and \"Half-Life\" fans, this game will no doubt be a walk in the park. No new enemies or weapons either (bummer!), so in terms of new weapons, \"Blue Shift,\" gets 2\/10 (because the MP5 changes to an M4 Assault Rifle when you apply the H.D. pack, so nothing really \"new\" I'm afraid). In terms of difficulty, it's 2\/10 for Easy, 4\/10 for Normal and 5\/10 for Hard. Just trust me, the game is not very challenging and will most likely be a frag-fest for most gamers, and there's never a shortage of ammo (unless you're a trigger-happy freak!) so \"Blue Shift,\" just ain't a challenge my friends.\n\nThe characters you encounter include Scientists, soldiers, and various aliens that you've probably seen a thousand times. So no points for \"Blue Shift,\" on that level. As a Security Guard you will now need to use helmets and body armour to keep yourself safe instead of H.E.V and P.V.C chargers like Gordon Freeman and Adrian Shephard. In this way there's a new approach to protecting yourself, which is a refreshing change. You won't fight the more advanced, powerful aliens as Shephard did and you won't encounter any Desert Eagles, Sniper Rifles, S.A.W's or anything cool like that. In some ways \"Blue Shift,\" is a regression, but nonetheless, it's still fun as hell and action is fast, realistic and furious! 10\/10 for Gameplay!\n\nOverall \"Half-Life: Blue Shift,\" scores a comfortable 3.5\/5 or 7\/10 if you like. My personal advice is that if you want value for money, this probably isn't worth it. If you're looking for a real challenge, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a huge expansion pack, well, \"Opposing Force\" is bigger, but that's it. If you just wanna kill s***, frag, run, jump and play with the all-new H.D pack (on all Half-Life games) and are a \"Half-Life\" fan, then you should already have this game. I'm reluctant to just say \"buy it.\" That's what I've found and what others have agreed upon, so you be the judge. Not bad at all, but too short, too easy and very few new features...","summary":"Really Good but way too easy and short - but the H.D.

N","reviewText":"Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is a game with which I have a checkered history. The first time I played Circle of the Moon the experience was not positive as I got to an antagonizing boss fight (which is the \"polite\" way of putting it) at the halfway point, quit and sold off my cart. However, since that point I've been making it a point to get all the Castlevania releases (don't ask me about putting down the massive amount of money Dracula X costs) and well, I figured this was just one bridge that had to be crossed... even if I had to use the cheapest tricks in the book to cross it. Needless to say there were certain parts I still felt were incessantly cheap when I replayed it - and I replied in kind - but I did manage to finish it. However, I can say right now it's a game I will not be revisiting much.\n\nBut why? At first I couldn't really but my finger on why Circle of the Moon is such a chore but the closer I got to the end of the game the clearer it became. Unlike Symphony of the Night (which is good but is psychotically overrated by the series fandom) Circle of the Moon wants to be more reminiscent of the pre-Symphony titles (mostly in the difficulty department) while making use of Symphony's gameplay. This odd concoction of old and new is simply bizarre and is reflected in nearly every aspect of the game from its somewhat depressing color palette to the fact that the story is barely existent\/important. Additionally, as trite as it may seem for an action game of this variety, I think I might have cared more about the game if I actually cared about the game's protagonist. I can't really point the finger square at Nathan being a bad character due to lack of development as this is fairly commonplace in Castlevania games - here's a castle, go kill Dracula - but the fact that Nathan isn't a Belmont is a pretty big blow to the setup.\n\nThere are few other irritations to be encountered as well. Personally I found the copy-and-paste-from-previous-games soundtrack to be very disappointing as half the fun of Metroidvania games is hearing the new tunes. Then there's the fact that half the time I spent playing the game was dedicated to grinding for DDS cards which just brings the game to a halt (which the Underground Waterway does a good job of as well) and the last two boss fights couldn't possibly be more night and day from one another - e.g. you better be good at dodging Dracula's ultra damaging dash attack or you will never beat the game.\n\nIn the end Circle of the Moon isn't a bad game, but to me it just does all sorts of little, irritating things (there are unfortunately many more I didn't mention) that add up to a massive migraine. Personally the game's only saving grace is the fact that it is inexpensive and easy to procure but if I was going to play Castlevania on the GameBoy Advance I'd rather play Aria of Sorrow any day of the week. I can't hate on Circle of the Moon that much, or suggest that people avoid it, but the truth is Konami has done much better than this - even if you exclude Symphony of the Night.","summary":"Replicating the magic of Symphony is not so easy...","unixReviewTime":1386288000,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Did it pay for itself? Did Valve simply want to keep the fandom salivating? I think the real reason Blue Shift was released was to update the weapon models and keep the game looking halfway decent (spotted a pun? I didn't!)\nThe game actually does very well for what its objective was. You get your professional quality extra missions, and the idea of revisiting those infamous areas from another angle and time is simply fascinating if you take a moment to look around. The tradition put in place by Gearbox Software (where you see Gordon jump into the portal to the Xen homeworld) is one of the selling points behind this game series. Of course, Blue Shift lets you play as THE Barney, as some people call him. He's not that Barney, or that other one. He's the one in the tram! What tram, you say? Well, it doesn't really matter except to say that he is the one who escapes the disaster of Black Mesa. If OpFor was the depressing chapter, the Empire Strikes Back where we find out that the G-Man is...well, the low point of Half-Life, Blue Shift is the relatively uplifting finale, and the chronicle of one of Half-Life's individual victories.\nWhat you see is mostly new, and the level geometry is vastly improved, though the enemy AI is still that \"just post-Metal Gear Solid\" scripted stuff, as Valve took pains not to break compatability with old mapping styles, and old maps and mods are still quite playable.\nIf there is anything that I can say which you won't read anywhere else, it's this: The music isn't anything new. The Opposing Force (OpFor in the jargon of our embedded game reporters) music, though I spent many hours playing it on a regular stereo under headphones, is only suitable . With noise, inappropriate, painfully solid and metallic reverb effects (it's not the base but rather the higher frequencies that are a killer), bizzare and sometimes randomly constructed passages, and generally too predictable advancement from the beginning to the end, it seems at times as if a simple heart beat or Gordon's breathing would have been an appropriate replacement which wouldn't have occupied the larger portion of the disk.\nThat's not to say some of these sections frankly work: the section where you are trapped inside behind a blast door as an Osprey takes off works pretty well in conjunction with a rapid fire series of staccato drum beat, and the very last section's music sets the melancholy, introspective nature of the soldier's predestined fate in Opposing Force. That said, Blue Shift appropriates this music of questionable aesthetic qualities and does not attempt to improve on it at all. I don't feel it was an appropriate way to constrain the cost of developing this \"standalone expansion,\" and a selection of some of Half-Life's excellent original tracks would have been quite welcome here. After all, one remembers tracks 2,3,10, and many of the others from Half-Life long after the pain and oppresion of the whole post-HL game audio have faded from your mind. Track 15 from the original Half-Life? One of the best game tracks in existance, on any format. Track 15 from Blue Shift? I have no clue what it is anymore, and it may have been one of the better ones (though I think 17 was more promising..)!\nThat said, you don't have to suffer through that music playing the original Half-Life or any multiplayer mode with the improved weapons models. At this price, you have little to complain about, and another classic Half-Life box design sitting on your shelf, with THE Barney on it, is certainly not embarrasing for a gamer.

It ran so poorly on my old P166 that I ran out and upgrade to an AMD K6-2 400 w\/ a Voodoo 2 card just to play it. Half Life, I'm sorry to say, almost brought a relationship to ruin before I learned to temper my interest. The plot, the player's involvement in what's going on around you, the attention to detail and your immersion in a world that's just real enough that, when the everything starts hitting the fan, you begin to feel like it's actually happening in your own world.\nTo say nothing about the multiplayer capabilities. The previously mentioned relationship once again faced abandonment once I got DSL.\n\"Blue Shift\" WANTS to be like Half Life was, and it wants to REALLY HARD. But it fails in so many ways. For one, it's too short. For two, it doesn't feel quite as connected to the first two games in this series (Half Life and the other expansion pack, Opposing Force, another fine example of immersion and plot). If you play Blue Shift to the bitter end, you'll understand what I mean.\nThere are plenty of scripted sequences, and more interaction with the scientists.

Your character just isn't quite as compelling as Adrian the solder from OpFor or Gordan Freeman from Half Life. You jump, you fight, you die, you replay.\nMaybe I'm just getting tired of the same old Black Mesa or the world of Xan. Or maybe I was unhappy with the fact that Blue Shift didn't add much by way of multiplayer \"stuff\".\nOn the plus side, however, Blue Shift comes with OpFor. So if you've never played OpFor, and you have an old copy of Half Life lounging around, and you've got a hankering to jump around, flip some switches, and hammer on some scientists with a crowbar, buy this game.\nOtherwise, go play some \"Counterstrike\", or purchase \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\". You'll spend your money more wisely, then.","summary":"None-too-thrilled","unixReviewTime":1008547200,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

There are some cute\/cool tie-ins from the previous games (like when you see Gordon jumping through the portal to Xen).\nThere is also the High Definition pack which improves the graphics-look\/feel of the weapons.\nHowever, one note of warning: if you play Half-Life in DeathMatches, the HD pack makes it difficult to use the crosshairs...  Why?  Well, for instance, the tip of the M-16 covers up the crosshairs somewhat when it fires.  In the game, this is not an issue, but in HL-DM it can be problemtatic.  The solution to this is to change crosshairs to more visible ones...but I digress.\nBasically, the game is nice from a story continuity standpoint, but if you don't care about the \"Gordon\" story, then it is probably not worth buying.","summary":"Fun, a bit too short, not quite worth the $$$","unixReviewTime":1007510400,"vote":"7","style":null,"image":null}

BS supports three video modes Software Rendering, Direct 3D, Open GL (Default and 3dFx mini). BS is a stand alone game meaning that you don't need the orginal half life for installation, Play half life before you play this game or else you would not understand the story and it might spoil you half life gameplay when you play later. Here you play a security gaurd Barney Calhon in the black mesa research center, When you are taking the tram ride to work in the first level of the orginal game half life you could see a security gaurd pounding on the door, That is the charecter you play here. The graphics, sound and charecter details are much better here, There are even reflective surfaces, You could see one when you are in the tram ride, But still the graphics are nowhere by today's standard's. Blue Shift has the same weapons from the orginal game, No really orginal weapons and not all half life weapons either. The Crowbar is here, That's good, It is the best weapon that needs no ammo, But the crossbow is not available, You could get all HL weapons only if you cheat. BLue shift does not have many monstors, No new monstors or tough ones. Another surprise is that BS does not have the big boss climax either, Though it has a good ending, I liked the half life ending, But not many gamers did, All gamers would love the BS ending if only it did not come very soon. Though blue shift is very short with very few weapons, Few monstors and dated graphics, It is a must if you are a Half Life fan.","summary":"Half-Life: Blue Shift","unixReviewTime":995932800,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

However, when the game in question is Half Life, arguably the best selling and best reviewed game in modern computer history, the rules that apply to other titles simply do not apply here.  With a endless supply of fan made levels, modifications, dominating hard the world over, and with a mod, Counter Strike, being the most popular online game, one would wonder if Valve is in no rush to release a follow up to the game. The Highly anticipated Team Fortress 2 is over a year and a half past its anticipated release, and has yet to make it onto the release radar for the near future. Half Life 2 is a top secret project that has a tighter lid of security around it than the next Star Wars film and the Colonels secret recipe.  So what is a Half Life fan to do with nothing on the horizon save for a few fan mods? Well, the folks at Gearbox have created a follow up to their smash success Half Life Opposing Force and retuned to the Black Mesa Facility with  Half Life Blue Shift.  The original Half Life cats players in the role of scientist Gordon Freeman as he attempted to escape from the Black Mesa facility following a accident that saw the facility flooded with all manner of deadly creatures, as well as ruthless government troops sent to silence anyone who saw to much.  Opposing Force expanded the role by casting players as CPl Sheppard, and Special Forces soldier dispatched to Black Mesa to restore order.  In Blue Shift, players get to take on the role of security guard Barney Calhoun. The events in the game take place at the same time as the other two games, as Barney attempts to get out of the Black Mesa facility. Along the way, players will battle monsters, soldiers, solve puzzles, and help stranded scientists along the way.  While the game was fun, it was far to short. I was able to complete the entire game in under five hours, and found myself wanting more after I was done. The game does not offer any new weapons and while the graphics engine is updated, and updates the graphics on Half Life and Opposing Force, there really is little here to make it stand out from a fan made mod.  There are no new weapons, monsters, or settings in the game, and I was surprised to discover that the game did not feature a boss monster anywhere along the way as the previous games in the series did.  A further piece of concern, and yes it is nitpicking, is that the character you play in Blue Shift often interacted with Freeman and Sheppard in the previous games, but Freeman is seen only briefly, and has no real impact on the game.  That being said, it is important to know that Blue Shift was originally designed to be a console only game, and it was decided to offer the game for PC users as a bridge to the upcoming Half Life 2.  Blue Shift also comes with the full version of Opposing Force, a utility to update the graphic resolution of Half Life and Opposing Force, as well as a rebate for those players who have previously purchased Opposing Forces. The game also does not require any previous version of Half Life to play, though understanding the Half Life Story will greatly fill in the games storyline.  In summary, Blue Shift is a nice return to a classic game scenario but is far to short and fails when compared to the previous titles in the series.  7 out of 10 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS P233, 32Mb RAM 300Mb HDD RECOMMENDED SYSTEM PII-300, 64Mb RAM 3D accelerator","summary":"Good idea, but way to short.","unixReviewTime":992476800,"vote":"9","style":null,"image":null}

Not in the sense of genre, but in the sense of literal darkness. The game is very hard to see. And 2)there are NO saves or passwords.\n\nTo solve both of these problems you will need a game light and some cheat codes. Once you overcome these two obsticles, you will start to enjoy the game. One thing about using the cheat to get to different levels is that the area of the screen which shows you how many points you have accumulated will have its place taken by coordinate numbers. These numbers were probably used to debug the game by the programmers. So you will not have a total score when playing with the level cheat. That's really too bad because you won't know just how well you did on each level.\n\nAs you play throught the levels, you will encounter some pretty fun gameplay. The levels are thought out well and some of the levels are pretty challenging. If you do not have good eye\/hand coordination, you probably should pass on this game as you will really need to time your moves well.\nThere are \"secret\" levels that you will unlock and it will take you a while to understand how to defeat some of the bosses, but all in all, I would say this is a pretty fun game.

The racing action is very fast and intensely exciting, and many of the competitions are very challenging.  Also, there seems to be some behind-the-scenes handicapping going on so that you're never really out of any race - I've had horrible multi-mishap runs where the difference between first and last was only a second or two.  This keeps every run exciting to the finish.\nUnfortunately, after a while, all of the competitions get repetitive.  Career mode should have been so much better, but it turns out to be very linear:  trail competitor-race competitor-win competitor's car-repeat.  When racing for pink slips, you put up nothing in the wager, so the heat's off you every time.  If you lose the first time, just keep trying until you take the poor guy's car.  It would have been better to have a dynamic wagering system where you build up a bank account and race primarily for agreed-upon amounts of money.  After all, in the \"real world\" of underground racing, no one would automatically accept the ultimate challenge so readily.  The wager system would make a race for slips a real event rather than just another notch on your belt.  But what good would the winnings be unless you could spend them on goodies for the car?  The cars in the game are all stock - you can't upgrade them or trick them out at all.  If you could use your money to do this, this would have given the game much more lasting appeal.  Hustling other online drivers out of their money in an Emu quietly souped up to perform like a Veloci would keep me coming back night after night.\nAll in all a fun game, but not the sure-fire rave that many other reviewers are making it out to be.

While you can \"fly\" your freedom of movement is, some what, restricted to 2D fighting style.  Sidestepping is available but there are no rolls or jumping commands.  The special moves are also limited to 7 slots per fighter.  These slots are used by capsules that enable you perform the various moves and\/or abilities.  While you can customize your fighter, you first need to unlock or purchase the extra abilities.  Another problem is that transformations and special abilities take up room you would otherwise use for moves\/abilities.  For example: in order for Goku to become super you need King Ki Fist X2, X5, and X10 equipped, all-in-all taking 4 of your 7 slots.  This adds a challenge to an otherwise straight-forward game.\nThe story mode covers the Sayen saga through to the Android saga.  Being that it covers such large ground DBZB skips certain episodes in order to get to the fights quicker.  You will have a chance to be the heroes and some of the villains in the story mode.  Just about every fighter in the game can be unlocked for the other game modes (Duel, tournament, and Practice).  The skills shop allows you to get most any skill you need.  But don't stay to long because you cloud purchase repeat items.  In order to purchase items you need to win tournaments for money.  The harder the tournament the more money you get.  There is a First prize and a second prize only.

And when I got the first 3 games: \"Dragonball GT: Final Bout\", \"Dragonball Z: Legends\", and \"Dragonball Z: Ultimate Battle 22\", I was overjoyed. \"Ultimate Battle 22\" was pretty good (even though there was no story) with good graphics and pretty cool moves. \"Legends\" was awesome... the graphics and the fighting style used in this game were very unique and made each fight exciting, just like the ones in the show. \"Final Bout\" was pretty awful, despite the fact that it was the first game in 3D. But \"Budokai\" has proven to be the best so far. The story mode is awesome: this is the first fighting game I've seen that actually has a story built into it and it's almost completely accurate to the show.\nThe graphics are great and the fighting style... well, it's not wonderful, but it's alright. I'd say it was like a mix between \"Dragonball Z: Legends\" and \"Dead or Alive\". There's also a tournament mode (you take part in the World Martial Arts Tournament), practice mode, duel mode(v.s. mode), and edit skills, where you customize the fighters with fighting moves and attacks by using the capsules you acquire in story mode.\nThis game goes from the Saiyan Saga to the Cell Games Saga (although it completely skips the Garlic Jr. Saga); I'll explain how the story mode goes:\nWhen you first play the game you're Goku and you fight Raditz, Nappa, Vegeta, Fake Vegeta(while training in the Capsule Corp. spaceship) Recoome, Captain Ginyu (you even fight Ginyu in his own body while Ginyu is in Goku's body), Frieza, and Android 19.

Then you're Vegeta and you fight Zarbon, Frieza, Android 19, Android 18, and Cell.\nAlong the way, you also do some special bad guy role playing levels. First you're Vegeta and after you defeat Goku, Krillin, and Gohan, Vegeta becomes a Super Saiyan in front of Yajirobe. Then you're Frieza and after you defeat Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, and Goku, Frieza wishes for immortality from Porunga, blows up Namek, and heads for Earth on his spaceship. Finally, you're Cell and after you defeat Android 16 and Android 17, Cell absorbs Android 17 and when trying to absorb Android 18 he accidentally absorbs Krillin! Yeah, he then becomes weaker, short, and orange. Then after you defeat Yamcha, Cell gets incinerated by Tien's Tri-beam; suddenly, you see Cell in his Perfect Form waking up from a nightmare in the middle of the Cell Games Ring.

The button layout is simple but effective (punch, kick, guard, and energy), and the action of the in-game fights match the frantic pace one would expect from DBZ. The problem lies within that each of the character's moves vary little from each other. In other words, each character's moves are almost identical with the exception of a few special techniques tagged onto the end of the combos. Another bothersome feature is that you can't perform the large energy beam attacks outside of a combo. On the positive side however, there are several different game modes to help add variety. While the average player can plow through the entire story mode within 2-3 hours, there is still the World Tournament and The Legend Of Hercule modes to clear. The skill editing feature is really just a gimmick, but is a welcome addition nonetheless. So if you are a Dragonball fan that's looking for another way to enjoy the series, Budokai is definitely worth a look. Those simply looking for a great fighter with lots of depth can afford to pass this one up.","summary":"Great presentation, but the gameplay needs improving","unixReviewTime":1041033600,"vote":"6","style":null,"image":null}

There are squad blasting missions, sneaky missions, missions where you need to slay a certain person, and other missions where you just shoot everyone in sight.\n\nThe graphics are reasonably good - trees have individual leaves, the helmets have sayings scrawled on them, bursts of blood come out from shots. The weapons and outfits are well done.\n\nThe sound goes for realistic over arcady. You don't get fun bouncy soundtracks as you fight you rway through the jungle - instead you're surrounded by gunfire, the shouting of your commander's orders and the cries of the wounded. It does get a little repetitive, though, as you hear \"destroy that tunnel!\" for the 20th time in a row.\n\nThere are booby traps and tunnels, napalm and death. You shoot women in the head, see hands blown off. In general this game really earns its mature rating. Heads burst like a balloon, and some of the mission situations are questionable. If I was a Vietnam Vet (or a Vietnamese person for that matter) I'd be pretty annoyed at the portrayal of what an 'average soldier' was like.\n\nIf you're a shooter fan and are looking for lots of blood, and can disconnect the game with the history it's playing, then you might enjoy this.

My main complaints are as follows: GRAPHICS: now don't get me wrong the cars look great, it's just everything else.  Scenery, or lack thereof, lacks detail and there really is nothing else to look at but the cars.  PHYSICS: these cars are WAY to sensitive.  Just about any amount of pressure is enough to make you spin out if your not careful.  CHALLENGE: ok something is wrong if you can finish all the races and only lose one of them (late spinout - see physics statement).  Lastly, the CUSTOMIZE section: this was the one part of the game that was hyped the most and I'm sure most people were looking forward too, but let's face it, there really isn't that much to it.  Except for rims, you basically have just a few parts for each section of your car (all cars use the same parts).  The one thing I did like was the two player and online modes.  They are about the only thing that I can recommend this game for.  As long as people online use broadband like it says to.  Nothing more irritating than trying to play against a dial-up competitor.

Now, let me tell you, this is nothing compared to the original Red Faction. For some reason, THQ had put it on cruise control for this version and instead of making it better, they had made it much worse. This game is a Run and Gunner, which I said on the title. If you are not into this genre, don't rent it.\n\nPros: 1. Walls can be blown up, dented, fragged, etc. (original, I think)\n\n2. Solid Multiplayer Mode (up to 4 players with bots.... but can only have 6 playing though.)\n\nCons: 1. Plot is very stale (don't really get a background on Sopot (supposed \"bad guy\") or any of the main characters. And the plot twist in the middle of the game does little to make it interesting)\n\n2. Cutscenes redefine the definition of \"bare bones\" (some take less than 5 seconds!)\n\n3. \"Multiple endings\" is a joke (no real change in ending of game, just a change in the AFTERMATH of the game which is not affected by decisions, but by only friendly fire!)\n\n4. Graphics leave much to be desired.\n\n5. Grenade throwing is iffy.\n\n6. music and sound aren't that good either.\n\nFinal Verdict: My belief is that this game is not worthy of being bought.

Though the gameplay idea is almost the same- run, run for your life and hide! Or attack with something that might come in handy. No matter if you played any CT games before or not, it will take some time to 'learn the curve' and develop some tactics in those 'boss battles', which I find the major turn off in this game. But once you get used to it, its not a problem.\n  The juicy part of this game- enemies. They are nicely made:appearance, story, theme music. But why they are Oh so predictable? Sometimes when they jump out all of a sudden and scare the main heroine, its pretty cool,but when it happens over and over again, added with some stupid repeating phrases or laughters from them,or when they are just following you non-stop, it doesnt seem so scary or intriguing anymore, but more like annoying. It could be much better, if the enemies were more intelligent.\n  The story is promising and somewhat gory (at least the first two parts).But unfortunately there is no replay value, except for some alternate costumes, higher difficulty level and bosses with other weapons.\n Now onto the conclusion:\n some might love this game, some might hate, some might just leave it in the middle. If you aren't a survival horror fan, I highly doubt you will fit in the first category. But if you are, there is a big chance you will enjoy CT3 while waiting for that new RE\/SH to come out!","summary":"dont judge a game by its title","unixReviewTime":1195257600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

They are tense, they are action-packed and they are fun, but scary? No. If you're looking for chills as opposed to thrills, seek out any of the Fatal Frame or Silent Hill series.\n\nBut if you've played all of those and are looking for something to tide you over until the PS2 release of Resident Evil 4, then consider the often-overlooked 'Clock Tower 3'. Set in England, you play Alyssa (what is it about that name and the Survival Horror genre??), a fifteen year-old schoolgirl on the trail of her missing mother, travelling through time and reality and evading the unwanted attacks of a number of ghosts and serial killers.\n\nGRAPHICS: 5\n\nBeautiful big characters, gorgeous scenery and excellent design make this one a pleasure to watch. Some of the lowlier ghosts are a bit chintzy (but after all, they can be dispersed with a \"Sentimental Item\", so what was I expecting??) and the overall visual impression lacks a Horror-style punch, but what the game does, it does very well.\n\nSOUND: 3\n\nAverage music and average sound effects provide the backdrop for some of the most outlandishly bad voice acting in a video game. Ever. Remember Resident Evil 1? \"It's. A. Monster. Run. \". This is worse. Cheesy and OTT with no effort given to atmosphere, this really does drag the game atmosphere right down.\n\nPLAYABILITY: 4\n\nThere are no weapons and no means of killing your pursuers until the actual boss battle, so running and hiding and using pre-set 'Evade' points is a very fun way of keeping Alyssa alive. Also this adds to the tension like nothing I've ever seen before. Simplistic controls and a really good camera system kae this one good fun to play, even if it does get a bit repetitive later on. Nothing to upgrade and plenty of special items means that there's no real challenge, though.\n\nLASTING FACTOR: 2\n\nThis is a very short (4 hours and sixteen minutes first play, subsequent plays are less), very easy game. The final Boss is a b*stard to beat, and you need to keep every single special arrow you find in the game to even be in with a chance - he is unfairly tough, given the game's remedial difficulty levels. Replay value is low - though there is a replay mode, but it's not that different from the actual game.\n\nOVERALL: 3\n\nFun, flashy, and tense, this is a great deal if you can get it cheap. What it does, it does very well, and even though it's a total one-trick pony, the fact that it's so short means it never becomes stale. Recommended as a last resort when you've played all other Survival Horror games available.","summary":"On the better side of Average.","unixReviewTime":1111795200,"vote":"5","style":null,"image":null}

The game starts off really strong, with Alyssa battling Sledgehammer, and as you race around finding clues to a child prodigy's murder and solving puzzles, the Hammerman killer is genuinely creepy. The game will make your pulse pound, and your fingers ache. The next villain, Corroder, is almost as intense as Sledgehammer, chasing you through an abandonded water-works, with hiding places more sparing, again leads to great, exciting game play. But then you get to level 3 and Chopper...a very annoying, feminine slasher that just gets on the nerves and doesn't do much to keep you jumping. The same goes for the bizarro ballerina's turned slashers on level 4, Scissorman and Scissorwoman. Neither character produced chills, and the high pitched taunts issued by both would-be killers get more annoying than frightening as the game progresses. The final boss, Lord Borroughs, is also a disappointment. After making your way through four pretty tough levels, your left facing off against...an English Gentleman??? The gameplay is quite fun, and I enjoyed the concept of running and hiding from killer spirits, armed only with holy water, but the fright factor drops considerably after the first two levels. The graphics and sound are really good, and the eerie music rivals that of Silent Hill in setting the mood. I would recommend this game to fans of survival games, but be sure to get the Resident Evil series first.","summary":"Decent Fright Factor, But Not on Resident Evil's Level","unixReviewTime":1101686400,"vote":"8","style":null,"image":null}

One of them is that you lose the vibration feel that the corded version has in itself by Nintendo. That remains unfortunate.

However, it tends to stand out a little better on Gamecube. Since there are no online squad-based game sfor Gamecube, the focus is on the single player mode, which is actually good. The levels are varied, but are fun to play through. You can get assault rifles and rocket launchers, as well as handguns. Split-screen play supports 4 players, but isn't all that exciting. If you want a multiplayer game, try TIMESPLITTERS 2.\nAs for problems, there are a couple. First, there is no online play. Sega did it with PHANTASY STAR ONLINE, so why can't anybody else? Second, the camera sometimes moves awkwardly, which makes aiming harder. Also, the camera gets worse in split-screen. If you are not willing to learn the levels, CONFLICT can be very difficult at times.\nThere is only one other squad-based battlefield game on GAMECUBE, GHOST RECON. It focuses more on taking cover in the bushes, and giving your team directions. It is also a first-person game, while CONFLICT is a third person game. CONFLICT focuses more on action.

Inverarity","reviewText":"Namco's reputation for developing great and influential games is deserved, but some older games have survived the passage of time better than others.  The evolutionary dead ends -- fantastic ideas that simply didn't influence successive generations of games in obvious ways (Joust, Warlords, Missile Command, Marble Madness) -- are the really lively part of classic video gaming.  Namco's blessing and curse is that it successfully predicted (or perhaps determined?) the future path of video gaming.  This collection is hurt by both that and the stinginess reflected in the short game list.\nTo address the first: Pole Position is included on release after release of NamcoMuseum.  It's a racing game, very modern by classic standards, that fails to be fun.  Why?  It was a good game -- so influential that almost any sixteen-bit-and-earlier racing game was its child (this includes Sega's great Virtua Racing series).  Unfortunately, the games that follow in its footsteps outdo it by miles.  Therefore, nostalgia is the only real reason to play it.\nThe other games make out better: Ms. Pac-Man is a blast, even though the whole franchise is overrated and overexposed; Dig-Dug is the gem of this collection, providing plenty of bizarro rock-dropping, air-pumping, dig-dugging action among the pookas and fygar; and Galaga and its (surprisingly fun) forbear Galaxian round out the shooter niche nicely, though, again, they inspired so many copycats (after copying Space Invaders first) that they feel rather diluted.\nWhy only three stars?  Well, to get to the second point, there's only five games!  Even Konami, whose classic arcade games are criminally underrated and who can't have expected decent sales, managed to get six games on their GBA cart.  I refuse to believe that any of these ports, no matter how accurate, took up very much space.  Xevious, Mappy, Toy Pop, Bosconian, even RallyX (all but the first evolutionary dead-ends)... at least a couple of these could and should have been shoehorned onto the cartridge somehow.

Martin","reviewText":"Okay here's a video game series that I'm sure everyone is familiar with by now. In some way or another, Mortal Kombat has graced your life with its presence. You've either experienced the game for all it's brutality in the arcades, the saturated versions we got on home consoles, heard about it in some angry parents consortium pushing to have the game banned from stores, or heard about the game's two famous creators. Mortal Kombat 3 spares nothing in terms of making the series stronger and bringing to life the concept of the almighty Fatality.\n\nThe one thing that really confused me about MK3 was that there were two versions of this game. There was MK3 and then there was MK3 Ultimate. Now I've personally never played MK3 Ultimate having owned the original MK3 since it was released in stores but the only real discernible difference between the two, from what I've been able to gather, is the addition of some characters and some new moves for some of the original lineup from MK3. Why they couldn't have released MK3 just once baffles me because the thing that's really annoying is when you're trying to find things for MK3, like manuals or box art, no one's ever heard of anything other than MK3 Ultimate.\n\nAnyway, the guy in the antagonist's seat this time is Shao Khan, lord of the Outworld. Basically Shao Khan attempts to take control of the Earth Realm by having Queen Sindel born in the Earth Realm. This allowed Khan to step into Earth Realm and once that happened, naturally, he killed everyone on Earth except for those who were chosen to protect Earth the only way they know how to do it, Mortal Kombat style.\n\nOne thing you have to talk about with any Mortal Kombat game is the moves and the fatalities; the symbolic trait that brought the game to starlight status. MK3 introduced a combo system which could be performed by pressing the right combination of buttons while in close range to your opponent. Following behind that was the ability to run and the run gauge. This allowed you to close the distance between you and your opponent and keep the pressure on them. You have your classic fatalities that each character can perform when the famous \"FINISH HIM!\" appears after your second victory. In addition to the fatalities, we have our beginning dosage of animalities, babalities, and friendships. There are also stage-exclusive fatalities such as the Pit where you can uppercut your opponent off the bridge and down to their ultimate death.\n\nAll of the special moves you can perform with the characters are usually no more than four to five consecutive button presses. These usually consist firstly of a series of directional buttons followed by a series of lettered buttons. Unfortunately some of the characters have special moves, and even fatalities, that require you to press up on the directional pad. Ordinarily, pressing up makes your character jump. So when you're trying to do a fatality with a character that requires you to press up, nine times out of ten you won't be able to perform the fatality because you'll jump instead and this can become very irritating. Another irritating aspect about the controls is the block\/run buttons. Any MK veteran, playing MK 1 and 2 on the SNES, knows that the L and R buttons are the block buttons. With the introduction of the run ability, R became the run button and L was designated as the block button. So naturally I'm trying to block an enemy attack by pressing R instinctively thinking that it's going to block when instead I'm trying to block an attack by running. That makes a whole lot of sense. The only other really irritating thing about the controls is the difficulty when it comes to trying to perform a melee combo. To this day I still can't figure out how to pull off a combo. I've read on it numerous times and practiced and practiced but still can't figure it out.\n\nOne thing that might drive a lot of people away from this game is the difficulty. MK games have been known to drive quite a few gamers to launch controllers at walls but this one will give you nightmares of shattered controllers. As a testament, I put the game on very easy, raised my handicap all the way to the max, and played on the master selection to fight as many opponents as possible. I couldn't get past the third opponent no matter how hard I tried. It's like the game picks up on everything you possibly do. Either that or some characters just naturally hate others. Sometimes you can't even lay a finger on your opponent because they just rip into you and there's nothing you can do about it. You can block everything you want to because then you'll get stuck in what I call a \"throw-trap\" where they just throw you around. You can't block throws so there's no way around it.\n\nGraphically the game looks great. The motion-capture technology used to generate the sprites for each combatant and the environments and the interactivity are superb. Levels are sometimes comprised of one or more floors and if you start your battle on the lower floor, you can uppercut your opponent through the ceiling into the second floor and continue the fight up there. It brings a whole new level of depth to the battles making it appear as if the battles are extremely intense. The detail on the character sprites is great for the SNES. If you ever get a chance to, or use the \"Enable Pause\" cheat, get a really good look at Shao Khan. His sprite is nothing short of awesome.\n\nThe music becomes a little repetitive at times. I understand when it comes to fighting games that background music usually isn't the most important aspect but when you compare the music of this game to the music of, say, Street Fighter 2, I'd much rather listen to SF2 simply because of it's vast musical variety. The music in MK3 is just somewhere around a few tracks and they're recycled over and over and over again.\n\nOverall MK3 is a great game to play if you have the patience for it or are a fan of fighting games. It acted as a benchmark for the series and displayed a whole new world of brutality for the genre. It also gave plenty of people something to talk about.","summary":"For MK Fans, Not For Casual Gamers","unixReviewTime":1242691200,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

There are a good amount of positives about the game that make you want to play it but there are too many negatives about the game that don't make you want to buy it. One of the bright aspects of this game is how it molds the story into the movie and throws some comic book story in the middle of it. For some missions you are teamed up with Black Cat. You take on Doc Ock, Shocker, and Mysterio and for the most part the boss battles are the best parts about the game. Another positive thing about the game is your web slinging is more than just pressing a button and you stick to the sky and swing forward. You have to attach to buildings and things like height and the angle you fling your web at reflect how you swing. At first this is extremely frustrated for even the biggest gamer but by the end the control you have makes you just want to swing a jump through New York forever. Now comes the negatives and what makes this a lackluster title. I never felt challenged at all in this game. There was one part where you have to swing out to the statue of liberty to fight mysterio and that was the toughest part of the game. If I wasn't a Spiderman fan I probably wouldn't have liked this game very much but being Spiderman makes it fun. I finished the game in about 5-6 hours of playing time. If you are a decent gamer you could finish this in a Saturday of playing the game. This is the one reason that this game is a solid rental.

Gibbs","reviewText":"Let's get this straight: as movie adaptations go, this is no Riddick. It has been a long time since Activision made quality games. They tend to rely on a license to sell the game, and save money on production. In many respects, Spiderman: The Movie 2 is typical. Most of the game is incredibly shoddy. Even on the XBox, the graphics are terrible. Clearly, Activision doesn't want to spend the money on anybody with real artistic talent; character models are barely more than PS1 quality, textures are ugly, cut scenes are incredibly bad. Writing, except where taken directly from the movie, is stupid. Many of the missions are also poorly thought out, and there are occasional bugs cropping up. In one scene, where Spidey is supposed to chase the Black Cat. I had the Cat get stuck against a building, running in place, but Spidey still couldn't catch her (because she wasn't in the \"right\" place to be caught) until eventually she managed to run through the solid \"brick\" wall. On another occasion the game hung and had to be reset (save often).\nAll that being said, they got the two most important things right: It is a free-roaming game, and they have managed to come up with a bland but recognizable model of Manhattan for Spidey to roam in. And they have finally gotten the web swinging right. Weblines now have to have actual attachment points; if you leap off the Empire State Building (and you can), you won't find any other web attachment points until you fall to the level of the surrounding buildings. You don't actually have to target specific buldings; just point the joystick in the direction you'll want, and Spidey will try to find something to web. Web swinging is in realistic arcs. Fortunately, it doesn't hurt Spidey to slam full-tilt into a building, because  you'll be doing that a lot at first. I can't convey how much these two factors redeem the game. As bad as everything else about the game is, swinging around Manhattan is an incredible blast, tricky but exhilarating (there is an easy web swinging mode for the kids; I didn't try it).\nThe basic game play is cribbed directly from titles like Grand Theft Auto or some of the recent Tony Hawks games (which is good; if you are going to steal, steal from the best)--you swing (or walk, if you prefer), until one of the generic pedestrians flags you down with a mission (with incredibly poor animation--Activision is too cheap to spring for facial animation, so they stand there bland-faced and wave their arms about). Unfortunately, there are only a dozen or so basic missions, so you'll basically be doing the same thing over and over.  There are also \"race\" tokens scattered around the city, where (if you accept the optional challenge) you have to hit certain tokens with a time limit. But the web swinging is so much fun that you probably won't mind. Combat is OK, basically cribbed from the Capcom Marvel fighting titles (which is a good thing), with lots of air combos. Fancier web swinging and fighting techniques have to be purchased with hero points you earn from missions, which provides a slight RPG element. Every once in awhile, you'll get a scripted challenge, some of which are \"boss\" fights, generally with a higher difficulty level. Unfortunately, these mostly tend to be more annoying than entertaining.\nThe frustrating thing about the game is that the web-swinging dynamic is so great that you tend to resent Activation for not building a decent game around it. Don't get me wrong; if you like Spiderman even a little bit, you will enjoy this game. But with a little more work and investment, it could have been one of the greatest games of all time.\nThe game supports 480p on the XBox. Unfortunately, it does not support 16:9 format, nor does it have the ability to add sidebars. So if you have a widescreen TV that insists on filling the screen with a 480p signal (as many do), the game will be stretched horizontally, and you'll probably end up having to go into the XBox control panel and turn off 480p just to be able to play the game without distortion.","summary":"Could have been great","unixReviewTime":1088899200,"vote":"9","style":null,"image":null}

There currently are a limited number of new games in the pipeline for the current consoles, as developers focus resources on games that will probably be released next year.  I check daily for news of a new Tri-Ace or Mistwalker game, with no news.  This can be a good thing, however, as it gives us a chance to go back and play some of the games from the previous generation(s).  As a result, my PS2 has been pulled from the closet and placed next to the 360 and Wii.  I decided that it was a good time to pick up this trilogy.  It may seem pointless to review a game that is 11 years old, but the portable gaming systems and PSN \/ XBOX Live \/ Wii Virtual Console have given new life to old games.  Old games are often regarded as being among the best, and many of them are \"new\" to younger gamers that never got to play them when they were originally released.\n\nXenosaga was one of those games that I had always considered playing.  I am a big fan of Xenogears, and I was blown away by the hype for this game when it was announced around 2001 or so.  But after seeing its direction and witnessing it first-hand, at a friend's house, I decided that there were many other games that I should play instead.  I've had 11 years to attempt to curb my initial disappointments with the game.  I haven't decided if it's allowed me to warm up to the title or it's strengthened my disappointments.  I consider myself to be a veteran of console RPGs, as I've been playing them for at least 24 years now, across all manner of consoles.  I still have my original NES Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy carts, as well as many SNES, Genesis and TurboGrafx 16 games.  I love console RPGs and I've played games from virtually every major series at some point.\n\nAnd that's why I have a problem with Xenosaga.  It is apparent that it excels at absolutely nothing when compared to the rest of the games out there.  Positive reviews on this game seem to merely be from apologists that want to hold this game in the same high regard as Xenogears, or maybe even gamers that prefer to watch anime over playing an engaging or challenging games.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints is the audio.  The audio is simply a disaster.  I've come to the conclusion that Mitsuda simply doesn't want to work anymore, on anything.  Once one of my favorite composers, he puts so little effort into his music these days that you could just as easily insert any third-rate composer into a game and have it turn out all the same.  There might be approximately three main tracks throughout the whole game.  More often than not, however, the game is completely silent.  The dungeon and battle music are so annoying an uninspired, which is a shame because you will be listening to them for countless hours.  This is one of the first times where I've ever played a game with the volume turned down so that I could listen to my own music collection while playing the game.  Only when you get to the final area are you actually treated with good music.  The final boss battle and ending music are indeed good, but it's not worth playing for 40 hours to finally get to this.  The same man that created the awesome music for Xenogears \/ Chrono Trigger \/ Chrono Cross (another junk game, aside from the soundtrack) offers virtually nothing to game music anymore.\n\nAnd it isn't even just the music.  The voice acting is pretty disappointing as well.  I know that many people have preferred Shion's voice actor in this game over Episode II, but I simply cannot stand her.  It's not that she is a bad voice actor, but she just seems wrong for the part.  She sounds like a 50-year-old woman playing a character in her 20s because that's exactly what she is.  I would say that the only characters that I really found to be tolerable were Kos-Mos, Jr. and Ziggy.\n\nThe battle system is terribly slow and boring.  It's like a watered down version of the Xenogears battle system, but you spend more time watching animations than actually playing.  The progressions between actions are crude and lack any degree of fluidity.  It literally takes 10 seconds to do even the most basic attack because you have to watch charging animations.  To add to this, the AWGS are absolutely useless (I *never* used them except for the parts where you are required to use them) and there is hardly ever any real degree of challenge.  There used to be a time when RPGs offered some real challenge and required actual strategy, but someone decided that this should take a backseat in this game's design.  To give you an idea, I beat the Proto Dora in less than 4 rounds, and it never got a single chance to attack.  I finished the last two bosses on similar terms.  I think that there was only one battle that was remotely challenging, early on, but only because it's the point in the game where it assumes that you've already learned the battle mechanics.  A poor battle system like this is a problem since, while enemies can be seen, most paths are too thin to actually avoid battle.  It's very much a precursor to the disastrous Final Fantasy XIII in almost every respect.  The games are so similar in terms of gameplay, slow battle progression, terrible music, and sterile linear environments, that the resemblance is uncanny (graphics technology aside).  Dungeons literally take hours to complete because you are wandering about fighting enemies on linear paths.  I wouldn't actually mind this if the story was at all captivating, but it simply is not.\n\nYou spend approximately 30 hours waiting for something interesting to happen in this game's story.  By the time you get to the end of the game, it seems like it might actually turn around.  Instead, you are left on a cliffhanger for the second game.  There is absolutely nothing in this game that actually develops the series plot or characters.  It's just 35-50 hours of pointless scenarios in 3 hour dungeons.\n\nMenus are poorly designed.  To apply the numerous types of points to your characters, you have to navigate to no less than 4 different menus.  The system lacks any degree of refinement and the point system is needlessly convoluted.  In contrast, a good game would have placed them all into a common menu to apply points to learn skills or enhance stats.  Generally, there is no good reason to apply points to the strength of tech attacks early on, because there is little payoff.  It is, however, good practice to apply points to the tech attack speed, and apply points directly to a character's ether defense and vitality.  But the game does such a poor job of defining which things are useful and which are not, that it is probably easy for some gamers to waste points on things that have very little return (HP) or useless spells.  The vast majority of spells that are useful belong to a sole character, but these can easily be transferred to everyone else, completely negating anything that it unique about the character.  As such, you will probably stick with 3 characters throughout the entire game because the alternative may mean that you are going to spend time grinding for points to get everyone's tech \/ skill ether points on par with the most-played characters.  There is no incentive to use anyone else.\n\nVisually, the game was dated even by 2002's standards.  Environments are sterile futuristic grey corridors and characters are messy blobs, with PS2's characteristic \"jaggy\" features.  The lack of progressive scan even in 2002 was unforgivable when even the lowly Dreamcast supported it in nearly every game with the VGA box in 1999, as well as the Gamecube with component cables.  And while graphics are not the most important part of an RPG, it's annoying to have to be forced to watch 10-15 second animations for boring attacks.  The only time that these can be skipped is when the game designers \"cheat\" by carefully inserting an MPEG2 video animation into the game.  Kos-Mos' XBUSTER is one such example.\n\nPlaying through Takahashi (and Soraya Saga's) games of the past two generations makes me realize something that many people do not consider.  They simply can't do it without Masato Kato and many of the others that were involved in Xenogears and Chrono Trigger.  I am one of very few that also didn't really like Xenoblade, which I felt was artificially inflated with boring fetch-quests in order to create a greater \"perceived value\" for the game.  There simply was very little meat to the plot and the gameplay.  Interestingly enough, I see that Kato was involved in Monolith's Baten Kaitos and I've read that it has superior writing.  However, I have not played it (yet).\n\nTo close, it's simply unforgivable to create a 40-hour linear RPG game that does absolutely so little with the plot or gameplay.  This game literally serves no purpose but to introduce you to the next game, which I hear also takes a turn to focus only on a few characters rather than the plot of the actual game.  We'll see how it goes when I begin part II today.  I may be part of a minority that will actually like Episode II better than the first.\n\nThis game is literally the \"Star Wars Episode 1: Phantom Menace\" of Takahashi's ambitious Xenogears series and prequels.  And while nobody will officially admit to the connections to Square's properties for legal reasons, all of the basic lore is there.  It may be a \"re-imaging\" of the series, but it contains many of the core plot elements that were relevant for Xenogears; so much so that many of the terminology and the timeline is the same as what was proposed in \"Perfect Works\" and Xenogears.","summary":"It is Evident Why I Ignored This For 11 Years.","unixReviewTime":1364083200,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

If you're looking for a jaw-dropping RPG that will leave you addicted, get Final Fantasy X (at the nice new rate of twenty bucks a pop).  If you've already beaten that twice, then get Xenosaga.\nAll the good elements are there: it's a (sort of) FF style RPG with nice graphics.  The main hook for me was the story.  The cutscenes were incredibly long.  But it didn't matter, because most of them were riveting, and sometimes frankly creepy (i.e. Albedo ripping his own head off and laughing).  Presented in beautiful anime-style 3-D CG graphics, the story that begins to unfold is gripping, and filled with many more-than-subtle refrences to different religions and philosiphies.  Love it.\nBut as for why it takes sixty long hours:\nThe gameplay is unbalanced.  Damage is dealt through special attacks, but though they are asthetically different, they all end up becoming 'short-range attack' for 'enemy on ground' and 'long-range attack' for 'enemy in air'.  This deceptively simple system would lend itself to fast battles, but the solidly turn-based fight system drags itself along like a fallen tree sloth.  Magic (called ether) is used, but rarely for anything other than healing, making your magic-user essentially useless once you transfer her skills to someone with more HP.\nIn contrast to the battle system, leveling up is hard, time-consuming and complex.  Seems that seperate points are required for each of three types of attribute, and these are critical if you want to survive.\nAreas.  Way too few, way too big, way too overused.  You only get about seven or eight main areas during the game, and over half can be summed up as gray ship walls with red spots, or red ship walls with gray spots.\nEnemies.  Too few types.  Stupid, predictable, and too easy to avoid, giving rise to the temptation to not train at all.  And they award so few points and gold that over half your time is spent killing the exact same enemies.  Blahzzzzzzzzz...\nMusic.  It rocks the first time you hear it.  And the second, and even the fifth.  But when you hear the exact same seven tired tunes forty hours into the game, you don't care that the London Philharmonic performed them.\nAll in all, the bad elements can be summed up in one word: repitition.  The boys (and girls) up at Namco spent all their creativity on the plot.  My personal suggestion: $%#@ the game, edit the CG sequences together and add in a few more, and release it in theaters.  It'd be great.\n***Note:  I saw this review now, a few months after I first wrote it, and decided that it was a little harsh.  I like the old-school world map with a huge variety of locations and quests (Baldur's Gate and FF7 are high in my list of favorite games).  I had a lot of fun with Xenosaga.  I just tend to really bash any characteristics of a game that get on my nerves.\nXenosaga sure beats the heck out of that THING they dare call a sequel to FFX.","summary":"Great plot, mediocre everything else...","unixReviewTime":1068422400,"vote":"5","style":null,"image":null}

From a pure gameplay perspective, UMK3 is what fans of the series expect.\n\nBut presentation-wise, things are looking very incomplete. While this game was essentially a full upgrade to the original Mortal Kombat 3 in arcades, here it feels like an expansion pack that can't interact with the original product. Missing are all the original backgrounds, and most of the announcer voices (like character names). Sheeva is no longer available, though a 'ghost' version of her remains in the code that causes the game to crash if used. Rain and Noob Saibot have no finishing moves, and many of the palette-swapped ninjas have recycled or modified animation to account for the SNES's limited memory. Some of the cuts are forgivable, some aren't, but in the end it feels like you bought 50% of a game instead of a full one.\n\nThere's really no reason to pick this up if you own MK Trilogy for Playstation or Nintendo 64.

I found out also this year you can buy a special controller set up for newer systems like PS3 that is a direct copy of the old Arcade-style controller for the original MK arcade games.

It also has a different sound a together. It has more of an industrial sound, where the Genesis version has more of a metal\/electronica sound to it. The graphics are also not as good either. Probably the biggest difference between the Genesis and this version was the sound, the sound is terrible in this version of UMK3. The gameplay has got a few glitches here and there as well. This is odd because usually SNES ports of Arcade games are generally really great, but this one fell very short. For the most part the gameplay is alright, not as nearly bad as MK1, that game was puking out glitches and other issues. This game also has kind of a funny glitch, instead of saying Brutality, it says fatality after completing one, that was pretty funny in a really bad sense.

The Genesis and Dreamcast were great systems. The Saturn however, is not the same caliber of those two systems.\n\nIf you've done your research on the system you know the Saturn had problems from day one. Sega decided to put two processors in the Saturn as a response to the Sony's announcement of the Playstation specs. This made development difficult, as a result, many Saturn games were inferior ports. Furthermore, they made a surprise launch (before the internet was popular)and no one was ready except for Sega. This simultaneously angered, retailers, developers, publishers, and consumers, simply put, the strategy backfired. In a nutshell, that is the problem with the Saturn. The system spent it's entire life trying to prove its superiority to it's competition, when in fact, the PS1 and N64 went on to be very successful systems.\n\nThat is not to say that the Saturn is a bad system. I would never go that far. I do believe it has some redeeming qualities that make it attractive to the right kind of gamer. I am simply saying it lacks the universal appeal that its competition has. So if you want to see if the system is right for you continue reading:\n\n1 First party titles. Much like the N64, the best games on the system were developed (or at very least published) in house. It's really a sight to behold Vituta Fighter 2 running at 640x480\/60fps and then seeing the Saturn buckle under trying to run some of the third party titles like Symphony of the Night. But even Sega had trouble with the Saturn, for a good example look at the original releases of Daytona and Viruta Fighter 1, they were re released later and look like someone put a new video card in the system. In general the first party titles run the best on the system. I'm not saying third party titles can't look good too, just not as much.\n\n2 Fighters. For whatever reason, fighters run particularly well on the Saturn. And of all the Capcom fighters in particular seem to run best of all. Darkstalkers and Xmen: children of the atom are very well suited for the platform. The fludiity of the animation, and the controls just flow in games like this. If you invest $40 in a 4MB Action Replay (think expansion pack for the N64) you can run games like Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter and Metal Slug and it really shows that the Saturn was mean to be a 2D powerhouse. It also helps that the controller is practically made for fighters.\n\n3 Imports. The action replay also allows you to run Japanese games. The Saturn was much more successful in Japan than it was here in the states, thus a lot more games were released in that region. As long as the Japanese text isn't an issue, you can get a lot of the games that never came here, or get the games that did come here significantly cheaper.\n\nThe real problem I have with recommending the Saturn is that they are not only hard to come by but surprisingly expensive to collect for. Think of it this way. The PS1 is not only cheaper to collect for, but is also easier to get games for in general, it has some expensive\/rare games, but there is more than enough quality software that is common. The Saturn has about the same size library that the N64 does but the expense and the difficulty finding games can be very prohibitive. Don't get me wrong, there are some gems to be had, but with digital distribution and services like XBLA and PSN re releasing older content. It's a hard system to reccomend.","summary":"Hard to reccomend","unixReviewTime":1362700800,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

One of them powered 3D, while the other one had the sole purpose of unleashing its 2D powers at a great 29 MHz. Now here is where the problems begin. Because the system used two separate processors, it made it very difficult for developers to create games for the system, because both processors must be worked with simultaneously, causing the system to not have a great variety of titles like it should have.\n\nUnfortunately, you know as well as I do that the best game for the system, Panzer Dragoon Saga has the unfortunate disadvantage of being one of the most expensive games to obtain due to its very limited print run. Please do not misunderstand; the system is not terrible, it just has a somewhat limited selection. While there does exist good games such as Hexen, Tomb Raider or Gex, which can be obtained at fair prices, I can get those for other systems and the reason I would want a Sega Saturn is to play 2D fighting games, which I am not exactly a fan of, or RPGs such as Magic Knight Rayearth, which cost a fortune to buy as these games had very obviously  suffered from limited print runs. On the PlayStation, I can purchase similar titles for a fraction of the cost with the same gameplay value as their Saturn counterparts.\n\nDespite not being a fan of 2D fighting games, however, I can still see that they are a great strength for the Saturn as there are a good sum of 2D fighting games to go around, and they can mostly be obtained at a decent price, so that is certainly a plus, but I cannot see myself thoroughly enjoying this system if I must spend more than $50 to play some of the games I would enjoy such as the RPG I have mentioned above and some other RPGs for the system. Overall, I would recommend this system if you are a 2D fighting or platforming fan, but if you prefer RPGs, I would recommend steering towards the PlayStation, since they are far better priced with a greater variety than the Saturn itself.","summary":"Good System, but Expect to Spend at Least $50 for Each Great Title.","unixReviewTime":1356652800,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

Rumble Racing is much like a Hot Wheels game, in-fact, apart from the backgrounds being more a realistic setting rather than a childs bedroom, both games are identical in many ways. You choose your vehicle and enter either a single race (exhibition) or a championship (usually consists of 3 to 5 races) and your goal is to come first place. In the midst of the racing action, you can also obtain power-ups, some may be useful, some needed to be thought out a bit better. You can obtain speed boosts, invincibility, better traction, shield's, and a not too thought out very well oil slick that would have been better if it had have been a smoke screen.. there are a couple of other power-ups, a few projectiles and bombs etc..  the coolest is when you are coming in last or so, you can obtain a tornado that sweeps through the tracks and blows everyone away. You can also preform stunts in your car when you jump over ramps and hills, a successful stunt will give you nitro boosts when you land, and you can preform multiple stunts in one go.\n\nThere is also some stunt challenges, and other modes of 2 player. Options allow you to turn power ups on or off, but one thing I found there is no option for is turning the controller vibrations off, as my controller freezes up sometimes when the vibrations go off, and it was annoying having to turn the controller on and off again during a race to gain control again. It may not apply to everyone, or anyone else, but how hard it an option to turn that on and off to be put in the game?\n\nBut I won't list that as a con, i'll be more fair to the games actual universal cons.\n- Graphics. It's a shame some cars have some nice details, but they are not the cars you want to race as.\n- Inclusion of too many filler cars. These are cars you can choose or unlock, but their profiles are slow and boring, hence you would never use them, letting them fill up unneeded space. There is maybe 5 or 6 cars you would use in this game, so why include about 20-30 you will never use?\n- No upgrades. It wouldnt be as annoying to have so many filler cars if you could upgrade them, but an upgrade in this game means 3 levels of looks, but the stats of the cars performance all stay the same. Pointless.\n- Not enough details in backgrounds. Sometimes I thought too much effort went into the design of one concept of the game, but the backgrounds and roads are what needed to be focused more on, as sometimes blurry graphics make you make a misjudgment in turns because you couldn't see what you where doing... some say it's PS2 graphics, but thats crap, other games managed to perfect it. EA should have considered something as simple as which colors to have next to each other and which ones blend in together too much. (Imagine is Super Mario was running along a sky background that matched the same color of his cloths)\n- Not many un-lockables worth unlocking. There is maybe 2 cars worthy of being unlocked in this game, only because there stats are almost flawless, however, there is no FLAWLESS car to unlock which is a shame. However, the Interceptor (cop car) is just about flawless in everything but stunts, it still manages to be behind the computer opponents in Elite mode. Do the stats of these cars in this game even mean anything, or are they just there for show? Get it right next time EA.\n\nThe game is fast paced, and does give off a feeling of tight action, and it's not simply a matter of driving as fast as you can, power ups and shortcuts are something you really have to know how to use well to achieve first position, so the racing is tough sometimes, which is a good thing. But the re-use of the same tracks over and over again really brought the game down a notch. It seems a bit unfair you have to race the same 5 tracks in the first 5 championships before you get a new one to try. Overall I think there is only about 10 tracks? If that.\n\nWhat the game could have used to spark it up would be a custom car builder, or paint jobs. As some of the faster cars you would most likely pick don't have the nice decals that a few of the slower cars have. And why on Earth someone would think unlocking a big slow RV would be fun to drive is beyond me? It's not like you can get the thing to go fast enough to use a weight advantage. Someone wasn't thinking too straight when they designed some of these elements.\n\nOverall.\nGraphics: 3\/5\nSound  : 3\/5\nControls: 4.5\/5\nOptions : 1\/5\nExtras  : 2\/5\nReplay V: 3\/5\n\nIf you come by the small chance of finding this game to rent, then check it out, it's worthy of a day or twos play, but after that, I doubt you will be lingering around to keep on playing it again and again. However, I did not play this on 2 player, so maybe ask someone else what it's like on those modes? I am only reviewing it on a 1 player and championship mode scale for the most part of this review.","summary":"Decent, but could have been better.","unixReviewTime":1361750400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

They are a little on the grainy side, especially during the introduction movie. Which doesn't make sense, because it uses shots from the game! How is it that playing the game looks better than the intro? The tracks aren't really anything special. Though I have to admit I have yet to see another car racing game with tracks full of places to do stunts.\nControls - Very smooth. No problems here.\nSound - Excellent. Cars have slightly different motor sounds, which you probably won't be paying attention to while you're racing, though. The announcer never seems to get annoying, even though after a while you've heard everything he says at least once. The music is okay, but once again, you won't be paying much attention to it either.\nGameplay - The main area where the game falls apart. For several reasons. For one, you HAVE TO have a friend to play this game with you while doing the championships and try to get the top two or three spots every race. Because the computer cheats, even on the easiest setting (forgiving) and especially when you start hitting the Elite class races. You need to get the top spots so the CPU can't win the gold, because if one of you doesn't doesn't get gold you can't advance to the next championship.\nHow does the CPU cheat? It seems to have unlimited turbos and unlimited traction power ups that it can seem to activate at will to counter the effects of other power ups and zoom ahead of you. Freeze, the ice power up that affect a cars handling ability will sometimes have no effect on them if they get hit with it, while it can end up getting you completely turned around and crashed into a wall. Plus the CPU seems to be able to take all the corners, turns and shortcuts perfectly. At the beginning it doesn't even use the shortcuts, but later it uses all of them and knows which ones to use to get better lap times.\nOnce you do manage to get gold in the championships, you will unlock one new car, and one new track. However, this unlocks only half the cars, as you will have to find a hidden egg on each track to unlock the other cars. Had I known this when I first played it, I wouldn't have been so pissed off the first time I played through the game. Because when I had finished nearly all the championships I still hadn't unlocked all the cars. Plus to begin with, most of the cars you do unlock are worthless. The only cars that have decent handling are Tiberius and Silver Streak. Don't even bother touching the other cars, not even the Cataclysm, though it has the same stats as the two I mentioned, since you will notice a difference in how the car handles. Which makes this game's cheating more evident, as it can seem to propel cars that have sublimely awful stats and handling to the top spots, since I've seen cars like The Banger place second.\nReplay Value - Almost non-existent. For one, the game is a pain in the ass to play through because of the cheapness and cheating of the computer. You'll never get the best lap times, so being able to race the tracks with your friend for fun to see who can get the best records has been ruined. The top scores for total race time and lap time for each track are IMPOSSIBLE to break! So are the scores on the stunt mode. Who the hell set these records, they have to be manufactured (meaning I think they were just typed in) because you don't have a hope in hell of ever touching them. So once you've unlocked all the cars and all the tracks, there isn't much to do. Like I mentioned before, 90% of the cars aren't even worth unlocking in the first place. You could play through the whole thing over again from scratch, but what's the point?","summary":"When the computer cheats, the game isn't fun anymore.","unixReviewTime":1087948800,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

As a matter of fact, that might be my biggest complaint about the second sequel.  Except for improved graphics, there really wasn't much of a change between parts two and three.  Sure, the trading and espionage system was altered, the wonders changed a little and diplomacy was improved, but if you played Civ 2 as much as I did, you should have no problem diving right into Civ 3.  I might have used the in-game Civilopedia for a grand total of fifteen minutes, otherwise it was as if I hadn't even left Civ 2.  I still had some classic Civ fun but it didn't last long.  I spent more time with strategy games that were nowhere near as good as Civ 3 only because they offered something fresh. Now, if you've never had the pleasure to play a Civilization game, quickly pick the latest edition up because it might be the most addictive strategy game ever.  Even to this day, I occasionally find myself reinstalling the game and spending an entire Saturday conquering the world.  If you're a Civ fanatic or Civ rookie, I'm sure you'll enjoy the newest addition but for the rest of the PC gaming community, you might want to wait until Civ 3 and all its expansions are packaged together into an economy deluxe edition only so you'll get a chance to play more new content in the sequel.  One warning for all gamers: On giant maps with the max amount of civilizations, this game can go slow, ESPECIALLY in later years when the continent is saturated with cities.  Civ 3 boasts the best AI of the entire series but I'm not sure a smarter computer opponent was worth the grueling decision making time for the CPU.  The game still captures the classic Civ magic we all love but I've played the first two games so often I'd rather see a remake of Alpha Centauri or Colonization which have yet to see a sequel.","summary":"I Wish Better Graphics Weren't the Only Positive Addition","unixReviewTime":1073606400,"vote":"4","style":{"Edition:":" Standard","Platform:":" PC"},"image":null}

The name should conjure forth in a player's memory countless hours of \"One more turn\", how much coffee the human body can consume, and the true meaning of the word \"Addiction\".\nI poured more time into Civ2 than I have *ever* put into any other game, hands down. To this day I find myself playing it for hours at a time...the game is perfect, has seemingly infinite replayability, and is a blast in multiplayer. So when Civilization III was slated to come out I was beside myself with joy. I was an almost daily visitor to the game's website, inputting my own questions alongside the other thousands of fans.\nBut how do you explain this game? To really understand the problem, one must look at both the inherent pros and cons of the game itself. In my humble opinion Sid got some things dead right, things that really do add to a game like this. And others it's like he forgot (God forgive me for saying this about a computer gaming legend like this) and got completely backwards.\nIn it's favor Civ 3 is very pretty to look at for a game of it's type. Animated units run across the landscape and terrain has a fresh and real feel to it. Another plus to the game is the addition of borders. I love it when I can take over a rival city bloodlessly and intact. And it offers incentive to throw production into buildings that otherwise might be sidelined in favor of military applications: Libraries and the like. The research tree makes a little more sense than it did in Civ 2, but I'll be the first to tell ya that I miss the old one a lot more. I keep hitting Philosophy and expecting to get a free advance, and when nothing happens I can't hide my disappointment. The animated battles are nice to watch, and I like the addition of levels of experience for your troops, ie \"Veteran\" and \"Elite\".  The end of the game, as I watch my Civlization's borders expand on the overview area, I can't help but think back to that turn and say \"I remember that!\", when certain events happen or Wonders are built. These are all great things about this game to me, and it's one of the reasons that I continue to try to win at it.\nBut the whole effort is hamstrung by some rather critical problems, ones that I'm surprised the gaming community doesn't seem to want to acknowledge, and those that do do it reluctantly. Here's some examples...\n - Units are horribly unbalanced. This has gotten a little better with the latest patches, but the fact remains that a guy wielding a sword should be NO match for a guy firing a rifle. It's frustrating to see advanced units fall before Medieval weapons...it makes no sense. I could forgive the game every single fault it had, if not for this single problem.\n - I have played, and played, and played. And yet I cannot seem to advance beyond Industrial Age despite the outrageous amount of time and effort I put into expansion and science research. I do not know what the American F-15 Special Unit looks or plays like. Nor the German Panzer. These will probably remain mysteries to me for as long as I play the game, and that bothers me. Civ 2 rewarded the player who put the most time and effort into Science by giving them technological edge over rivals and enemies. This, along with the unit imbalances mentioned above, seriously hamper the entire experience for me. Someone write me and tell me they've at least *seen* a Spaceship without cheating. I want to know if it's possible.\n - Diplomacy is a mixed bag. It starts out civil enough when dealing with other Civs, but I cannot see the sense in Hiawatha demanding that I give him World Maps, Money, and my latest Scientific Discovery, just so I can get useless World Maps in return. World Maps + 200 Gold + Printing Press does NOT equal World Maps, no matter how much of the globe he possesses.\n - The Corruption thing is a little out of whack. What incentive do I have to expand my empire when I know that my fringe colonies will never be able to build anything because they'll always have just one production shield? And yes I'm a Democracy, with a Police Station, Courthouse, Roads, and a Harbor. It makes me not want to expand because it's almost too much trouble.\nAs I said, I could let the game slide by with 4 stars if the unit imbalance issue was corrected, but even after all these patches I still can't get over the fact that a Veteran Swordman can take down an Elite Rifle unit while only taking 1 hit.\nStar Control 3.

Well, there isn't; and some would no doubt be quick to point out that one can not improve on perfection, so I will be quick to point out that one should at least try when it's my money they want. This is pretty much exactly the same game I played all those many years ago, and I can see almost naught a single change what so ever. That is my major gripe, and why it earns not but 3  stars, at least from me. I can't however ignore the highly addictive quality this game still retains. Maybe it's because it takes forever to play, only to be cruelly ridiculed by your CPU for not being better at it. More than a few times was my clinched fist hammered on the table when a stupid move on my part had cost me dearly. Such emotions can only be wrought by a program of quality, and good writing, or perhaps just plain stupidity on my part. Who cares, the game is challenging, and has it's moments.

At first it does intrigue,but then the flaws begin to appear. The AI is much too agressive and takes unfair advantage. The resources you need to build certain units are controlled by the very same unfair AI making diplomacy almost useless by the outrageous demands it makes and refuses to budge from. Cheats would be the only way I see to get on balance with the AI unless Sid&co deem to release a patch to level this out.

If you haven't played any of the Civilization games, by all means, purchase this game as quick as possible because you have no idea what you're missing!  A time encompassing game primarily about world conquest, you control a civilization from caveman times to the present day and expand world borders attempting to win the game in different ways.  The third version of this popular series still follows the same gameplay format that made it a universal favorite and that's why I had problems with it: It didn't change much.\nI suppose it's difficult for a software company to live up to a famous title's reputation when it's already one of the classic strategy games of all-time but I didn't feel like I got my money's worth after playing this game for a week.  Frankly, I'm already bored with the game.\nThere are some new and interesting changes to the game.  One of the most obvious new features is a system that relies on specific resources (oil, rubber, etc.) rather than allowing you the ability to build anything you choose.  Another great new feature is the expanded diplomacy option with just about anything in the game available for trading with other countries.  The game is much smarter now and computer opponents make better decisions.  This may have led to what I find one of the biggest problems in the game, the incredibly slow running speed.  The more computer controlled civilizations you allow in your game, the slower it runs from turn to turn.  Even with low amounts of civilizations, when the game has progressed to a later point in time and the world is heavily populated, it can take at least a minute for the computer to decide its moves in one turn.  I have a decent system and would recommend that anyone with a slow processor be prepared to practice their patience as you will be playing games that will take a LONG TIME.  I have no problem with strategy games that take a while before completing the objectives but Civilization III loses its appeal when I make decisions in a few quick seconds and then wait a minute or two for the computer to complete its turn.\nIf this is your first time to play the Civilization series, the instruction manual is phenomenal and it is equipped with an in-game encylopedia that describes all units, buildings, wonders, etc. to you.  I was disappointed that the game didn't come with enough new aspects to force me to read the instructions much.  I jumped right in to Civilization III as though I didn't miss anything from the previous version.\nThe provided scenarios\/maps aren't near as good as the other versions and civilizations do not start in their historically correct positions on a simulated world map.  I would check the internet as there are bound to be plenty of interesting maps and modifications created by players.  Also, the game does not come with a multiplayer internet format.  Knowing the recent history of PC games, the company will probably release a costly expansion pack in later months that will allow you to play this on the internet with other players.\nA great game for anyone that is new to the Civilization series but in my opinion, only a fair game for returning players.","summary":"I was expecting more from a sequel for a classic game.","unixReviewTime":1005177600,"vote":"25","style":{"Edition:":" Standard","Platform:":" PC"},"image":null}

The only problem is, you'll be lucky if you can see what your doing half the time.  The first thing you'll notice when you pop in Nightfire, are the surprisingly blurry graphics.  The enemies move around so stiff and the graphics are so blurry that sometimes you'll have a hard time telling if your shooting an enemy or a coffee table, but the enemies shout out annoying one liners at you so this doesn't become that big a drawback (then again..).  The clumsy item access interface that is found on any of the other Nightfire versions is here as well, but thanks to the GBA's limited control scheme it is harder to navigate items and while moving and aiming your weapon at the same time.  This becomes even more of a pain during the stealth missions.  However, Nightfire is not without it's charm; the music and sound effects are excellent and some of the best to be heard on the GBA, and there is a surprising amount of depth to be found thanks to getting to use all sorts of Bond gadgets like the laser wristwatch and tons more, all of which you have access to.

I've played the good (Resident Evil: Code Veronica), the bad (Carrier) and the awful (Countdown Vampires). Basically if the title has a creepy\/subhuman feel to it, I'm bound to give it a whirl. I really wasn't sure to expect with Illbleed, but due to the recent drought of Dreamcast games I bought it on impulse. Within the first 10 minutes I could say without blinking that this game was horrible.\n So why 3 stars? Well, once you get the hang of the game it is actually quite fun. Though it must be said that one needs a lot of patience to get into the swing of things.\n As I was saying my biggest beef with Illbleed is it's horribly steep learning curve. The instruction manual really isn't sufficient when it comes to explaining Illbleeds bizarre mechanics. The majority of people are going to start the game and die very quickly a few times before realizing what needs to be done or completely giving up. It has to be said that there is a graveyard that can be used for training at the beginning of the game. Though I can't help but feel that it was somewhat of an afterthought due to the fact it is practically hidden and borderline useless. On top of that, the first level is reasonably hard.\n  Illbleed reminds me a lot of the Playstation series Deception. The big difference is that you are on the receiving end of the traps rather then setting them. Like Deception, traps are numerous; most are random, some are not. To avoid the plethora of traps you have 4 senses, \"Sight,\" \"Sound,\" \"Smell,\" and \"Sixth Sense.\" They peak as according to how close the character is to the trap. At the beginning of each level you must find a \"Horror Monitor\" which you can use to mark off what you think might be a trap. The \"Horror Monitor\" can lead to extreme frustration for many reasons. Initially I had no idea where to find the \"Horror Monitor\" because it is well hidden in the first level leaving me confused about what to do and absolutely raging. Once it is found the biggest problem with the \"Horror Monitor\" is that disarming potential traps can be a total guessing game. This is can be daunting, considering that you are limited to the number of objects that you can warn because every trap mark off leads to a drop in \"adrenaline.\" Use too much too soon and you are not gonna last long. Don't use enough and you will probably be too beaten up to complete the level. On rare occasions the \"Horror Monitor\" is not just a shot in the dark. For instance, when a dead body is down the hall from your character and has potential to a trap the \"Smell\" and the \"Sight\" might spike, tipping off that you should probably mark off the corpse. Though after an hour or so you do get a feel for what is and is not a trap from trial and error resulting in a suspenseful environment rather than a frustration one.\n When you think of the average life bar in video games the first thing that comes to mind is a gauge that depletes as your character is damaged. Illbleed does not have one life bar, it has three. One is the standard strength gauge that all games have. The others are fairly unique; a blood lose gauge that monitors the amount of blood lost per second and a heart rate gauge. Lose all your strength, you die. Lose too much blood, you die. Get scared when your heart rate is too high, you die. It is very hard to maintain lifebar homeostasis. This may anger some game players but I felt it added to the perilous atmosphere Illbleed is trying so desperately to uphold.\n Illbleeds controls at times are plain insufficient. This is not entirely true when you are just exploring, though pressing the R-trigger constantly for the \"Horror Monitor\" gets mighty annoying. The controls are problematic during the fight sequences. I found that there is a one-second delay from when you hit attack and when the character actually attacks. Also, the camera during combat is inconsistent. It's either too far away, too close or is facing the incorrect direction so you cannot even see what is happening. You get accustomed to the control's and camera's sloppiness but nonetheless it is unacceptable.\n Story wise there isn't much of one, though it is similar to the movie \"House on Haunted Hill.\" There is a billionaire moviemaker, he is twisted, he is offering 100 000 000 dollars to anyone that can survive his house of horrors, people go in and don't come out, and our heroine must rescue them. Simple as that.\n Illbleed is not breathtaking but definitely visually pleasing. Characters move fluidly, textures are nice, and the colors are vibrant. The B movie feel adds a lot to the atmosphere and it is great to see a survival horror game that doesn't take itself too seriously. Though some jerky\/poor trap animations take away from the overall visual presentation. Lastly, the non-existent load times are very pleasing.\n I do recommend Illbleed, but definitely rent it before you purchase. After you conquer the initial confusion you are in for an original, addictive and humorous game.","summary":"Fun game, but patience is a MUST","unixReviewTime":990748800,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Many of them initially difficult, but once attacked from the right angle, they become clear. There are others, though, that I just couldn't figure out without the assistance of a walkthrough. Perhaps I'm a complete moron, but they just weren't intuitive to me.\nThe animation is very pretty, and the cutscenes of good quality. I wouldn't say the graphics approach Myst Exile, but they're close to Riven. This game does suffer from the usual Dreamcatcher navigational shortcomings, though - one is not allowed free movement; rather, there are only certain areas to click on, and then the game \"walks\" you to them automatically. I prefer being able to freely navigate the environments, but this does result in a lot more overhead on the game. Further, there was one area of the game that was nigh-impossible to navigate at all - it was intentionally disorienting, but I feel they went overboard and made it too frustrating. This is a pity, because this world (an underwater one that largely resembles a giant jellyfish) is very lovely.\nAs I mentioned previously, the plot had some interesting ideas that just didn't get fleshed out too well; the overall storyline could have been made much more interesting and exciting, and the characters could have been better developed. Still, despite its shortcomings, it's an enjoyable game that really doesn't take too long to play at all; even with the difficulties I had with a few of the puzzles, I'd imagine it took me less than 12 hours to play, start to finish.","summary":"Beautiful, but not hugely satisfying","unixReviewTime":1019174400,"vote":"12","style":null,"image":null}

They are right.  I have 2 computers, and for reasons that escape me one of them will not run this game.  As a result you may want to borrow it from a friend and see if you can get it to work properly before you buy it.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe battle system is very intuitive, and gives a nice ammount of control over your units.  You can tell them to aim for different mech parts, concerve ammo, or engage at a specific range.  You can almost pick the game right up and start playing it, though you may want to go through the training missions just to be sure you know about some of the finer points.\n\nThe mechs are also very well done, though I don't like the customization freedom with them (sure with the clan mechs it is ok since they are all omni, but last I checked most IS mechs were not). They do look a little blocky, however it does not end up detracting from the game.\n\nThe actors hired for this did a very good job.  Cut sceens are convincing and you actually get to the point where you feel like you know them.  The plot is fairly transparent, however it is more than enough to hold the game together and avoids the pitfall of making things too complicated.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe game is much too short, and much too easy.  First time I played through I played on normal and it took me 3 days.  Second time I decided to play on the hardest difficulty, and I am sad to say I didn't notice any difference.  Very few of the missions are truely hard (most that are belong to House Leio, and even they are just what I feel the average difficulty should be).  This means there is also very little replay value.\n\nAdding to the little replay value is the fact that the plot is 100% liner.  Nothing you do ever effects what you are going to do next or where you are going.  Once you have played through once, you have seen it all.  This also makes it feel like you arn't really a merc commander.  You don't get to chose your jobs or to weigh risk and proffit at all.  The game just strings you along, and no matter what your proformance in the mission if you complete it then you move on in the plot.\n\nMechs come out feeling a little flimsy with few exceptions.  This is mostly due to the fact that later on the head is much too easy to hit.  My standard tactic became pulling along a few mechs with long range weapons and just targeting the head of the mech.  It would kill the mech with little to no dammage to the rest of the mech, making it ready to salvage and giving me that much larger of a force for that mission.\n\nAnother thing that this game would have benifited immensly from would be some type of campaign\/mission editor to allow players to make thier own games.  This simple addition would have pushed this game up to 4 stars overall raiting and a 5 star fun raiting since the problems with the campaign could be overlooked with the addition of player maps and campaigns that would cater to differetn interests.\n\nIf you consider yourself a fan of MW I would give this a try, but don't expect the world from it.  The campaign is good enough that you won't be appaled by it, and the multiplayer is good (though nothing too terrably special as far as I could see) if you can find someone to play with.  If you are just a fan of RTS games you should look someplace else as this will leave you with a wanting feeling.","summary":"Concept is there, but the game is lacking","unixReviewTime":1100131200,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

(The evil enemies of that game projected more loathing and nastiness than you'll get from any real people, unless you work in prisons or a law firm).  While this is supposedly a sequel to the original Quake, it's very different - the code now supports hardware graphics acceleration (you'll know the difference if you've got a card because the game starts up in low-res and non-accelerated mode) for one thing.  For another, Id tossed out the plot of the first game, it's supernatural and occult-themed plot and all.  You're now a futuristic super-soldier sent to a remote planet populated by evil aliens who've rained havoc back on Earth.  Gone are the demons and zombies of the original, now replaced with alien cyborgs carrying particle weapons and all.  (Terran soldiers are landed on hostile planets by loading them in coffin-like reentry vehicles and shooting them at the targeted planet in waves.)  Still, despite the different storyline, it won't take fans of the original long to realize (if the packaging didn't clue them in) that they're playing Quake.  Though the graphics are a light year ahead of the original (3d card support and all), some effects - like the distortion of being underwater - looks little changed from the original game.  A lot of gameplay also remains the same (like looking for secret spots by searching for tunnels while underwater or in sewers).  The locked doors that \"are opened elsewhere\" and even the grunts your charachter makes when trying to open locked doors or while jumping may inspire enough deja vu to take you from Quake2's alien planet to the Necropolis of the first game.  Even the basic idea behind the levels seems a throwback to the bygone age that spawned the original - navigate a labyrinth looking for both a portal and its key.  The basic alien soldiers seem little different than the army of the undead from the first game, and your shotgun or rapid-fire gun works just as well on cyborgs as on the last games demons.  Much of the similarity between the two first Quakes is because of how far ahead the original Quake really was.\nAny way you cut it though, the 2nd just doesn't lead the pack.  For a true leap over its predecessor in the hyper-violent FPS category, and unless you're not stuck with something less powerful than a Celeron, try Star Wars: Jedi Knight, the sequel to Star Wars: Dark Forces.\nI ran this game on a Pentium 200MMX, with 64mb of RAM and a 12mb 3DFx card - graphics were smooth and frame-rate was high.","summary":"Great, but not best in its class","unixReviewTime":995241600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

You can also control up to eight characters, which is nice.  Unfortunately there is a total absence of plot or meaningful NPC interaction and there are no subquests worth speaking of.  All very Diabloesque true, and not necessarily a bad thing, but whereas the Blizzard title has a lot of collectible sets, configurable weapons etc, this has none, seriously denting its replayability.  This brings me to my biggest gripe with the game, the much vaunted 'play as you want to' system of character development, which does away with classes and develops your characters around the skills they use.  Sounds great on paper but in reality it means that the game is not particularly well balanced (particularly with regards to the Nature school of magic). It also further dents its replayability, as the conscious effort to play the game through in a different way with the same characters makes no sense when you've already worked out how to defeat particular foes.  Make no bones about it this game has set itself up to be a Diablo II beater (even going so far as to use the same color letters for different levels of rare , magic and unique items) but fails to address either of the issues that make that title so popular; excellent replayability and extremely simple but effective online play.  Last time I checked, Dungeon Siege was unplayably laggy online and only time will tell if Microsoft will put in the necessary ongoing support that this title needs.\nIn a world where swirly 3D visuals are rated more highly than gameplay (ie the games mags etc) this title will review very well\nbut I won't go deleteing Diablo II: Lords of Destruction from my hard drive just yet!","summary":"Not what the world was waiting for","unixReviewTime":1019692800,"vote":"8","style":{"Edition:":" Standard","Platform:":" PC"},"image":null}

You've undoubtedly heard that \"Dungeon Siege\" is a game brimming with awesome graphics, \"seamless\" gameplay, and heralded sound. And that's all true. But Dungeon Siege lacks the one thing that it claims itself to be: role-playing. Don't get me wrong; it's still a fun game to play. But if you're a gamer who likes strong plots and powerful character development (as I am), then Dungeon Siege may not be the game for you. However, if you were enthralled with Diablo II's hack-and-slash mayhem, then this might be just your thing. Still, Dungeon Siege lacks any type of user-chosen skill development. Rather, Microsoft has taken the opportunity to present us with a new kind of \"RPG\" that makes your character excel in different areas, whether it be magic, bow, or weapon, depending on how much you use them. Although I understand this thinking and feel it's a novel approach to a game, I would rather decide myself where my character's strengths are. In addition, much of Dungeon Siege is run by smart AI, meaning that your party of adventurers will do what they're told, letting you sit back and watch the melee until it's time to heal with a potion or change somebody's attack scheme. This is all fine until you realize that the whole game can seemingly play itself!\nI liked Dungeon Siege for its simplicity, as it presents a nice break to real time-stealers like \"Baldur's Gate 2\". But I can't help to feel a little let down by its elementary nature. The eye candy and sound are awesome, but everything else simply feels rushed. Quests are limited, as are social interactions with non-player characters. Too much of the game is simply walking into a field and left-clicking until everything is dead, with a random award of treasure.\nIf you're a Diablo fan, I have no doubt that Dungeon Siege will suit your taste. It's actually less of an RPG than Diablo II, but it's hack-and-slash nature will delight. It's hard to put down once you stop. For those into the epic storylines of Bioware's RPGs, then I urge you to play a copy of Dungeon Siege before making the full purchase. It's simplistic, unassuming tone will offend true \"RPG'ers,\" so you've been warned.\nAll in all, Dungeon Siege is a fun game to play, regardless of its faults.

The graphics are great as most people have pointed out, but there is just no gameplay at all. Rather than giving us a \"living, breathing world to explore\", the actualy in-game world is completely linear. Rather than giving us a variety of quests we just click on monsters, kill them and get treasure. Sure there are four different ways to kill them (melee, ranged, combat magic and nature magic) but a RPG that does not make. Many comparisons have been made to Diablo 2, but in terms of gameplay his is almost a step backward. There are fewer skills and spells than Diablo 2, and unlimited ammo for bows makes the game oddly unbalanced. There are several other minor issues but I won't go into detail. These include restricted camera movement, the overhead map being too small, strange behaviour at level-up meaning that your character suddenly cant cast spells, dodgy AI etc but I guess most of these will be fixed in a patch sooner or later. As per most modern games, you can create mods and Dungeon Seige uses the Seige Editor and the GMax 3d system from Discreet (a cut down version of the popular 3D Studio Max system). Although I haven't played around with the editor yet, it sounds promising and I hope that 3rd party mods will be available to make the single player experience the game that Dungeon Seige should have been.","summary":"Nice graphics, shame about the game","unixReviewTime":1018396800,"vote":"2","style":{"Edition:":" Standard","Platform:":" PC"},"image":null}

Generally speaking the AI is very aggressive at the beginning, but if you weather the initial assault, you can slowly wear down the enemy. The objectives of the missions are a bit varied, but they still felt somewhat redundant. There are six civilizations that you can play, but they are mostly the same except the units look differently.

The game flattened the competition with its near total immersion in the Star Wars environment that had been sorely lacking, even in the original Dark Forces in 1995. For twenty levels you became Kyle, the quirky smart-mouthed mercenary aiding the fledgling New Republic on a mission against Jerec and his cabal of Dark Jedi bent on locating and consuming the power of the Valley of the Jedi. A thousand years ago a great battle between the forces of light and dark saw thousands of Jedi spirits trapped within the valley. As Kyle you progressed in your powers until eventually having to make a choice between Light and Dark. To stop Jerec in order to keep the valley safe or take the power for your own and rule the galaxy.\n Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast is set nine years after Jedi Knight, making it 14 years after the fall of the Empire at Endor, and Kyle has abandoned his Jedi heritage after nearly killing Mara Jade at the Sith temple on Dromund Kaas when he fell to the Dark Side. Still working for New Republic Intelligence, he and Jan stumble across an Imperial Remnant base that appears to be growing gem-like crystals- similar to the ones found in lightsabers. It turns out that a fallen Jedi and the Remnant are attempting create a Force-using army by combining the crystals and the Force. The first couple of levels are also painfully dull and the goals are often poorly defined. After encountering the fallen Jedi Desann, Jan is murdered by Desann's apprentice, Tavion. Secretly, Kyle flies to Rusaan- the secret location of the Valley of the Jedi. There is reasserts his connection to the Force. Reluctantly Kyle must reclaim that which he abandoned, traveling back to Yavin IV, he meets with Luke Skywalker in order to retrieve his lightsaber. At the Yavin academy, Kyle relearns his basic Force abilities in a test devised by Luke before traveling to Nar Shadda to begin his search Desann and the Reborn.\n Game play is much improved over Jedi Knight in many areas, not least of which is lightsaber combat, which is now handled almost exclusively in the third-person view. I had misgivings about this, but having tried it out, I see that it's much better- allowing for greater control and freedom of action during duels. Graphics are not through the roof 'awesome', but very clean and exceptionally well detailed. I have a ATI Radeon 9700 Pro video card, so I guess I expect all new games to be earth-shattering in their visual appeal. Raven did pay close attention to lightsaber duels from the Phantom Menace- giving the ones in the game a distinct cinematic feel, especially when view from a distance in multi-player. Mostly the game is fluid- the visuals flow nicely and Raven manages to overcome one of the Quake III: Arena engine's short comings by producing attractive vistas, whether indoors or out, everything has the right Star Wars-zy feel and look to it.\n Weapons range from Kyle's Bryar pistol, E-11 blaster rifle, Bowcaster and Repeater Rifle, plus new additions like the Tenloss disrupter, which can disintegrate distant targets in sniper mode, an EMP gun for dispatching droids and other electronic devices, a flechette cannon which is just a knock-off of the flack cannon from Unreal Tournament, plus a rocket launcher. Kyle also has access to munitions like thermal detonators, laser trip mines (a la Duke Nukem), and detpacks that can be blown by remote control. All three explosives and the rocket launcher do far more damage than their small, wimpy explosions would indicate. An additional weapon that Kyle carries that I really liked are the portable sentry gun- a cannister that once dropped deploys a blaster turret and begins shooting enemies within its range. Players also get macrobinoculars, bacta canisters for healing, and light amplification goggles. Plus you will find no end of shield and health power-ups through out the levels. One of the game's down sides is that it is difficult to tell when you're being shot- there are no accompanying green flashes or sizzling sound effects as your personal shields take a beating\n The game ships with 10 multi-player maps, customizable Force powers to fine-tune your character. You can even play games without the Force, though it tends to favor the dark side powers. Multi-player games include standard death matches, capture the flag, king of the hill where only one play has a lightsaber and Force powers and it's up to everyone else to deal with it, capture the ysalamiri (the Jedi Kryptonite creatures care of Mr. Zahn). One of the down sides in single-player missions is Raven split Kyle's Force powers between the Light and Dark side. He can throw lightning and choke someone, but no longer has Force Seeing and Protection- two powers that were, in my opinion, instrumental in the first game. I didn't like the addition of Dark Side powers that seemed to be there just to satisfy those players who think the Dark Side is 'kewl'. Raven also has the Outcast version of its Q3 Radiant level builder and other tools, like script managers etc. for creating single and multi-player levels.\n This is an o-kay game. It didn't completely suck me in like Jedi Knight did, but it is a worthy successor. It lacks the impact of Kyle's momentous decision between Light and Dark nor is the story as epic. And strangely, the feel is closer to that of the original Dark Forces than it is to Jedi Knight. Plus it suffers a little too much from console hell like Dino Crisis, where on some levels you must find the key to open the door in order to get to the next key to open the next door. It has some nice animated full-motion video, but nothing like the live action scenes that added so much to Jedi Knight. It is also a hard game- get used to not completing later maps on the first try even on easy 'Padawan' setting, plus some of the jumping can be a little frustrating.

So on one hand, the game works very hard to achieve immersion.\nOn the other hand, the game's level design makes it almost impossible to achieve immersion. When travelling through a level, you are not Kyle Katarn: you're just a guy sitting in front of your terminal trying to figure out what the game designer wants you to do next. Puzzles are not intuitive, and the solution is usually a rigid, artificial and sometimes nonsensical sequence of actions. You have to run a gauntlet of enemies who have somehow positioned themselves in places that your own character could not get to--in many cases, places which are actively impossible for any living creature to have travelled to given the design of the level. At one point, you have to protect a droid from a host of enemies while also disarming trip mines. You can push the droid back using your Force powers, but only so far: push him back far enough and he spontaneously explodes. Why? Because the designer wants you to beat the level the way he wants you to beat it.\nIt doesn't have to be this way. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault has demonstrated that an FPS can have good, immersive level design without having to resort to this kind of straightjacket.\nJK2's multiplayer is decent enough, but it becomes boring fairly quickly. When force powers are enabled, the game is dominated by the boring over-use of force push and force choke. When weapons other than lightsabers are enabled, snipers and explosive weapons rule the day, but in no more interesting a fashion than any other multiplayer FPS on the market.","summary":"The Best of Times, the Worst of Times","unixReviewTime":1036886400,"vote":"8","style":null,"image":null}

It basically comes down to a bunch of players running around either wildly waving their lightsabors jumping through the air or there's the players who sit around and as snipers and take you out while your fighting with another player.

With some nail-biting missions and astounding detailed levels!  It is no doubt this game will be a hit among the Star Wars Universe Fans.  The best feature of this game is the Multiplayer support.  It is really something to be in the middle of 8 Jedi's all locked in Saber battles.  Let's take a look at this game as it does have its downs.\n\nThe STORY - You return as Kyle to help the Old Republic defend itself from a new evil.  A evil called Dessan and his army of Dark Jedi's.  A misson you are on reveals this new threat to the Old Republic and the death of Kyle's partner Jan, fuels the fire of Kyle to find and stop Dessan.  Dessan ultimate purpose is to create a army of invincible Dark Jedi's to rid the universe of the Jedi's sworn to protect the secrets of the Force.  Dessan feels that the Force is not something you proctect people from, but something you rule people by.  Get ready for a excellent storyline in this new Star Wars adventure.\n\nThe GRAPHICS - Are some of the best I have seen!  Bearing in mind you have a excellent computer with a high calibur video card.  I am currently running a ATI Radeon 8500 and the game looks spectacular.  I personally don't like crisp clear pefect graphics.  I like the graphics to have a little noise in it, for example the graphics in Return to Castle Wolfenstien.  But if you enjoy this, then by all means praise the graphics!  Storm Troopers will look nice and crisp as they attempt to blast you throughout the levels.\n\nThe GAMEPLAY is very smooth with the in game cutscenes.  Controls can be hotkeyed to your preference with enable you to have force powers ready at your fingertips.  You have a wide variety of weapons including a stun baton, rocket launcher, thermal detonators, rocket launcher, sniper rifle and the popular, non-accurate blaster rifle.  And of course you already know about the Light Saber.  The is the ultimate weapon that allows block weapons fire and slice your enemy's at close range at at a distance.  And don't worry about losing your saber, you can always get it back with the flick of your wrist.\n\nThe A.I. - Oh man, there are some ups and downs in the A.I. in this game.  There was only one time I have seen Storm Troopers run in a movie and that was when Han Solo was chasing them in the Death Star.  Storm troopers move like they are on some type of drug when you attempt to shoot them which is kinda of annoying.  If you come accross Imperial Officers, shoot them fast because they are extremely accurate.  Other Jedi's fight you on a level that is distrubing.  The lesser Jedi's are nothing compared to some of the Jedi's you will face off with in the later levels.  Dessan is one bad mother when you fight him.  Many of his blows will knock you down. And not to mention some Saber battles involve more than 2 jedi's at one time.\n\nIn conclusion, there are some great aspects of this game, mainly the action sequences.  In my opinion there are WAY TOO MANY PUZZLE AND SPACE WASTER MISSIONS.  I can understand having puzzles in games to take a break from the actions, but for this type of game, it should have been more action based.  In the last levels, making your way to the Jedi Academy will really drive you up the wall because of the environment.  The best aspect of this game is hands down the multiplayer. It is what makes this game really shine.","summary":"It takes more than the Force to become a Jedi...","unixReviewTime":1020124800,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

It uses the Quake 3 Graphics engines to utilize the best graphics in games today! It has BEAUTIFUL landscapes, and character details are AMAZING! Kyle Katarn has never looked so good!\nThe gameplay is nothing to scream about. It is exactly like JK's. That's probably a good thing. I found a few probs with gameplay tho. I realized that the aiming mechanism is somewhat inaccurate at times. Because the aimer always stays in the same position, you should always have the same accurate aiming. Although, this game doesn't have that. This is definetely not a game for Tactical Shooters fans.\nI also found that replay value is OK. There are 4 difficulty levels at which you can beat the game at, but I don't think that is enough. I mean, can't we atleast get a few alternative paths or SOMETHING??? It's the same game played over and over again, but at harder levels. Some people may find this cheap, but I think it's OK if you just start at the medium or hardest difficulty level. I started at Padawan (the first difficulty), and it's still pretty challenging. Expect to be infront of you computer a lot frusterated about a puzzle you must solve.\nIn general, this is a MUST for all JK fans. Tactical shooters fans may find this game a bit annoying, and people that are not fans of the first person shooter genre should not think about getting this game. FPS fans should consider buying the game, and may want to play the demo before purchasing. All in all, this is a game for the JK fans and FPS fans. I'm out now, so PEACE.

Long","reviewText":"I liked the first two Bloody Roars because of the ability to change into beasts in the middle of the battle, and the second one had a pretty good storyline for a 3D fighter.  Truth be told, this game is one of the chief reasons I bought a Playstation 2 (that and the soon-to-be-released Final Fantasy X).\nThe graphics are incredible.  They are so detailed that you can see the facial features on the characters, such as recessed and blinking eyes and moving mouths.  They aren't like the flat polygons used in the other Bloody Roars...in fact, you'll be hard-pressed to find sharp edges anywhere on the bodies.  The arenas are also composed of polygons, and they look as good as the characters.  Too bad that you can only blow out a wall on the final round...I miss being able to knock the opponent out of bounds!  All these graphics, and the game doesn't slow down at all.  Amazing!\nUnfortunately, now we get into an area that Bloody Roar 3 lacks...new ideas.  There is an arcade mode, a multiplayer mode, practice mode, and a survival mode.  In other words, it's like all the other 3D fighters.  And all of the characters from the second Bloody Roar are back, with only one new initial character (who looks like a cross between Alucard from Castlevania and Sephiroth from FF7), and two other characters that are unlockable, for a total of fourteen characters.  Sure, I like the original characters, but most of them have been around since the first Bloody Roar, and their moves have remained largely unchanged...time for something new!  As for the in-battle differences, the only new things are an extra beast-drive move and a hyper-beast mode, which makes you do tremendous damage, but when ten seconds elapses, you turn back to human and you can't become a beast for the rest of the fight.  Weeeee.\nThe gameplay, as I said before, was very fast and smooth on the Playstation 2...maybe TOO fast.  Since the first BR, I've noticed an increased focus on combos.  I'm not a *hardcore* 3D fighter, so my when I'm going up against an opponent that won't even let me move because he's pulling off a 10 hit combo, which tosses me in the air so that he gets off another 10 hits \"juggling\" me in the air, and then gets off ANOTHER 5 hits while I'm down on the ground, needless to say, I get frustrated very quickly.  Sure, there is a way to block these things, but as I said, the thing moves FAST, so most of the time, I don't have a chance to pull it off.  And don't bother doing combos of your own; most of the time, the CPU blocks it all in the later stages.  I'm having problems on the final levels on a dificulty setting of ONE.  Well, as I said, I'm not *hardcore.*  After about two hours, it got rather boring.\nUnfortunately, the good storyline of the second BR is gone in BR3.  All you get is a slideshow at the start and the end, all of which makes no sense, unlike BR2, where there is a slideshow in between each battle, and some storylines cross each other and make SENSE.  If I have to suffer five hundred gillion hit combos, then I at least want it to be WORTH something.\nBeing a 3D fighter, BR3 has a multiplayer mode.  Well, my friend just happens to be non-*hardcore* just like me, except his temper is even shorter than mine when it comes to being juggled in the air with a multi-hit combo. (His favorite fighter is Super Smash Brothers...go figure)  Needless to say, he got intensly frustrated, and trust me, it is no fun playing with someone that is ready to throw the controller through the TV.\nOverall, Bloody Roar 3 is a game that looks absolutely incredible, but a lack of a good storyline and an insufficient number of new features makes BR3 a weekend-rental title, unless you are a fan of the series.","summary":"Great looking, but dulls easily","unixReviewTime":993772800,"vote":"10","style":null,"image":null}

The Bloody Roar series started on the PS1, but has seen rocky acclaim ever since its first entry. Competing with games such as Street Fighter, Tekken, and Virtua Fighter at the time, people didn't see the need for another Japanese fighter. Bloody Roar features some interesting characters that can turn into Beast form which unlocks a new set of moves and some devastating attacks. Bloody Roar 3 has great visuals and solid controls, but lacks a large roster and modes that fighters are known for.\n\nFirst off, the game only has 12 fighters. That's tiny even compared to other fighters with small rosters. The characters, however, are unique but there is a serious lack of female fighters (only 4). The stages are busy and well designed, plus the game looks great even for today. The fight system is simple compared to most Japanese fighters, but I preferred this. There is just punch, kick, and beast form as well as a dodge and block button. The game has no move list, so this is for button mashers which is just fine here. The controls are smooth and responsive, and there is a lot of visual flair. The characters' beast forms look really cool, and it is fun to see them all.\n\nAnother main disappointment are the lack of modes. Just arcade, survival, and versus really. There's not even a main story mode, but the arcade mode does go through all the characters stories. I found the story to be pretty boring and unexciting like most fighting game stories. Most Japanese fighting fans will mainly dislike the lack of depth in the fight system, but I really didn't mind it.\n\nOverall, Bloody Roar 3 is a solid fight game, but just feels bare bones. The fight system lacks depth, the character roster is small, and there's only 3 modes. The game look great and the controls respond well, so this is a love it or hate it type of game.","summary":"A decent but thin fighter","unixReviewTime":1347926400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

If you change the options, it saves when you leave the options. If you do a time trial, it saves when you leave. I haven't gotten to any races yet, but I assume it would behave the same. It would be nicer to have a save item in the menu, or even making the save optional, instead of being forced to save.\nI found the graphics passible, and, as with GT (and GT2 minus its slowdown and other problems), it looks very bad compared to GT3, but isn't an issue once I get into the gameplay. Nonetheless, of the 4 PS2 games I own, it's easily the one with the worst graphics.\nThe sound is really bad. The cars sound like wind-up toys, and the music is better left off, which, fortunately, is an option.\nI'm going to keep playing, since the gameplay has elements that GT3 is weak at, such as more involved pit strategies, a field bigger than 6 cars, weather and time of day. However, GT3 (and GT and GT2) will definitely get more replay time.\n--\nAfter playing some more, the load times are still extremely bad.  Some load time for tracks is understandable, but it's still extreme.  Having to wait through the load screen to go from the track to the race standings or the menus is not understandable.  Also, the \"Race again?  Yes\/No\" menu misses the point, as it doesn't circumvent any of the loading.  The auto-save is annoying enough that I pull the save card out until I want to save my progress.\nThe racing itself is quite good, though.  The weather effects are pretty impressive during the race, the clouds rolling in, or the muted sun though the thinning clouds.  The rainy night racing isn't as well done, as the fake headlights do nothing to light up the road, so it means driving blind over certain segments of the tracks.  The replays have graphical glitches, particularly when it's rainy and foggy, but I've never noticed any such problems during the actual gameplay.  The chunky graphics, however, does affect the gameplay when on an unfamiliar track, as it's hard to tell whether the next turn will be a left or a right until it's too close to set up the correct line.\nThe normal mode AI is about as stupid as the GT3 AI.  I haven't tried the hard AI.\nThere is only rudimentary tuning, so there's nothing like the Formula GT in GT3, where each track needed different settings for success.  However, the downforce and tire grades can be changed in the pits, so the weather, tire wear, and fuel usage all factor into the racing strategy.","summary":"Long load times, annoying save scheme, terrible sound","unixReviewTime":1002844800,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

Buying up the new versions to see what had changed ended in disappointment. While the dialogue of FF4 has, thankfully, been improved and flows better, the rest of the game has not improved. What used to be an easy fight for me resulted in several restored games. Having all the deleted items restored to the game only served to muddle it up. Additional abilities were not all that useful. I found myself doing what I have always done: used what was familiar. The game took much longer to complete and I was getting rather bored before I reached the underground. To add to disappointment, there are a multitude of opportunities for new CG scenes to help with the tangled skein of the story and every one of them is wasted.\n\nAs for Chrono, not much has changed about this either. The animated scenes are a nice touch but there are too few of them. Their insertion is rather sloppy as well. They *look* cobbled on and don't really contribute anything. We should see the trio enter the Dome and find Robo and Lucca gets to work on him, not enter the dome, approach Robo and see the scene repeat in a way that we *know* did not happen (because we just saw it not happen that way!). We should see Crono killed by Lavos only once, not twice. We should see Ayla's approach and fighting Reptites only once, not twice. It exists in two different versions and having both options was a bad choice.\n\nThe galleries of both games are a good addition, but I think there's not enough of it. At least it's something to do when the game bores you.\n\nThese games are all right if you've never played them before. To longtime fans like myself, you might get why I feel a little cheated by the set.\n\nAs a sidenote, months before the release of FF3 on Nintendo DS, I wrote to Square and suggested that FF3 be paired up with one of the Game Boy FFs (such as FF Legend), in similar fashion to Chronicles and Anthology.

I know it sounds ridiculous that I'm complaining about petty loading times, but BELIEVE ME, once you play the ps1 version of Chrono Trigger you will be going nuts from impatience with these load times. If you're fast, you might be able to prepare dinner, or even take a shower while the menu loads up. And when you enter the next screen you might as well leave to use the bathroom. Okay maybe I am overemphasizing it a bit. I found myself looking for the SNES version after i got this just so I could take advantage of quick loading time. Which to me was a collosul waste of money since I paid for the Chronicles already. But now that the game is on Greatest Hits, it is worth it just for the ff4 disk alone. This version of FF4 is just as good (probably even better) than the SNES version. As far as I know it has more monsters and items too, since this version is the japanese one translated into American and not the watered down American version. And since it's only 20 bucks now, it's a great deal for these classic games. Final Fantasy 4 has very fast loading time on this and it really makes me wonder why Square couldn't have made Chrono Trigger faster. It seems as though every time Square releases a double-RPG set one of the games always has horrible loading. But truth be told, the loading times on Chrono Trigger are not as horrible as Final Fantasy 6's, which were by all means the worst loading times Ive ever experienced, and I'd rather pay for a Super Nintendo and the game itself so I could avoid them (and the SNES version is much better for that game anyway). I guess after all it is worth it to pay $20 for these two classic games despite the horrendous patience problems you will endure. Unless you can find it on Greatest Hits, I wouldn't buy it though.\noverall....about 3.5...but 4 was too good so i rounded down to 3","summary":"Classic games...not so classic load times...","unixReviewTime":1072828800,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

It breaks my heart to rate this game 2.5 stars, but it was intended for a larger screen original\n\nPACMAN ARRANGEMENT (3\/5)\nThe game by itself would deseve four stars (again, there is no saving) but it is almost identical to the originol PACMAN game. The only real difference is that it has brighter graphics and better music, and these aspects don't really add any enjoyment to the game.\n\nPACMANIA (3\/5)\nLike PACMAN ARRANGEMENT, this is extremely simalir to the originol arcade game only with better sounds and graphics. You can use the A and B buttons to jump over the ghosts which makes the game easier than it all ready is. Again, I am puzzled by the fact you can't save your scores.\n\nPAC-ATTACK (5\/5)\nThis is definately the best game in the collection. Like TETRIS, there are blocks falling from the sky that need to be arranged, but here some of the blocks contain a ghost. If you arrange the ghosts in the right order, you are allowed to eat them. The game-play is addictive and challenging. in fact, the game is so much fun I would buy PAC MAN COLLECTION just to have it in my GBA library.\n\nOverall, this is a flawed but enjoyable collection of games","summary":"Good Collection, but Could be Better...","unixReviewTime":1162080000,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

First there is the original hit game, Pac Man, where you are a little man with a huge mouth going through a maze, gobbling up pellets, being chased by ghosts in a never-ending quest. The next game is \"Pac Man Arrangement,\" which is essentially the same game, only with fun new features, such as a dash and the graphics are a bit better. When Pac Man runs over a dash, he will zip from one side of the maze to the other, past all ghosts that chase him. The third game is Pac Attack, which is a clone of Tetris, falling blocks, some with ghosts in them, and eventually a falling Pac Man to eat the ghosts! You score points by stacking a line of bars or by having a Pac Man eat the ghosts. The fourth game is a great Pac Man game for the present day called Pac Mania! It features crisp graphics, a 3D maze, 3D Pac Man and 3D ghosts, each with their own personalities! The point of it is to still eat all of the pellets in the maze, but now there are more ghosts and you cannot see the entire maze in just one screen. The mazes even have different themes to them, such as one maze will be made of Legos, another will be on the top of a roof! One more thing, now Pac Man can jump over the ghosts! It's a very nice addition to the Pac Family. The only unfortunate part to all of these games is that it does not save your high scores when you turn the game off! There is some nice variety to this game pack, but its not for everyone.","summary":"Good variety of play, Pac Man is Pac Man","unixReviewTime":1014854400,"vote":"11","style":null,"image":null}

Being a big fan of the show, I eagerly anticipated the gaming experience of competing against tribes and within the tribe, and suffering through tribal councils. While this game delivers these things, I was less than impressed overall with this game.\nIt starts out really well with character creation. Choosing different traits of your character is essential to winning the game. I mistakenly shortsighted my strength for empthany, which was a mistake later on in the game. You can even put your own name into the show!\nThen the game starts, and you go through Camp Time, a Reward Challenge, Immunity Challenge, and Tribal Council. One of the things you have to endure is painfully long uploads for each section. Maybe my PC is slow, but I actually took to reading a book between each event.\nWhile the camp time was fun in chatting with people, the reward and immunity challenges were often difficult to manipulate. My team kept on losing them time after time, and after awhile, I was down to three members, and all of us very weak. Managing the fatigue and effort levels for the team members was painful and not fun at all. I did enjoy the graphics of Tribal Council, and the voting was fun, but it seemed not to connect to anything that I could tell.\nI never made it to the merge because my PC crashed soon after, and I cannot now uninstall this game.\nOverall, this has been a mixed gaming experience. I felt that the \"Weakest Link\" captures it's game much more effectively , but it's much easier to simlulate a close staged gameshow than a open air survival show. Maybe with a few tweaks, this game could be really what it needs to be.","summary":"Survivor mania...","unixReviewTime":1006041600,"vote":"8","style":null,"image":null}

That really can be surprising from a world class video game icon like Mario. Arguably, when Nintendo developed Mario back in the 80's, he had proven to be the most successful plumber of all time. Still, the downside comes every so often, when a game does seem to actually rev up those engines today and back then, it does seem to cool down, and it has done it here a little bit too much. After the massive success of Mario Kart 64 for the Nintendo 64, Nintendo thought they had a sure hand victor again with another Mario Kart, but they were wrong.\nMario Kart: Super Circuit is the first racer for the Game Boy Advance that features Mario and his gang including Bowser, Yoshi, Wario, and Princess Toadstool who is known now as Peach, and a few others. Basically, it is the same gang as it was from Mario Kart 64. The game displays 20 different tracks, that really don't seem to break out as they did before, as well as the hidden tracks from the original Mario Kart. The game is mostly like the very first Mario Kart from the Super Nintendo, without a lot to showcase. The control here is also a lot harder to go around here, and can often try to frustrate you in the process, no matter what the course is. Although it is a little bit challenging, Mario Kart may seem more like a throwback than the successor to Mario Kart 64, or even the Mario Kart: Double Dash for the Nintendo Gamecube.\nIn all in all, Mario Kart: Super Circuit for the Game Boy Advance isn't as surprising as I thought it was. It actually seems more like another dull racer that it is on the inside, rather than the box on the outside. I only suggest this, if you haven't played the first Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo, but not if you've enjoyed the mass appeal of the other two Mario Karts. This isn't one on the money.","summary":"Red Shelled Crash!!!","unixReviewTime":1081382400,"vote":"2","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

For example, Mario will probably always be the king of platform games. Mario Party will always be the must-have party game. No one has even tried to top Super Smash Bros. But Mario Kart is an exception. Sure, Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo was fun when it was the only cart racing game out there and it was a new concept. But Nintendo has done almost nothing since to improve upon its own idea.\nIn Mario Kart Super Circuit, you will see essentially the same courses, same weapons and the same characters that you have seen in every other Mario Kart game. The courses are actually pretty short and boring. You spend a day or two playing through all the circuits to unlock nothing and after that there really is no incentive to ever play it again. If you can find some friends who have GBA's then you can have up to a four-player race. But in order to play the battle mode, which is probably the best part of the game, your friends all need to have not only the GBA but the game cartridge as well.\nOverall, this is a pretty sloppy effort by Nintendo.

I didn't understand the concept, the mechanics, none of it, and I was killed in the span of ten minutes or so and never looked back. Afterwards, word spread about its apparent genius and boundary-shattering appeal (it DID birth \"survival horror\", after all...) in such deafening volumes that I found myself gravitating back towards it years, and certain levels of maturity, later. The millennium dawned, I grabbed a copy of the GameCube remake and was scared out of my wits...and I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT, to the point where it's one of my all-time favorite games. Ironic, I know, but regardless my adoration of the series was thus born, growing more resolutely upon further exposure to the other games I'd avoided due to my original distaste. But there was one game I knew of but couldn't snag a copy of to check out myself: \"Code: Veronica,\" considered a wunderkind of a Dreamcast title, eluded my grasp as I did not own a Dreamcast (nor did I want one), and until recent years I felt that it would be forever out of my grasp. Until I spotted a used PS2 copy at my local used music\/game\/book store (I didn't even realize it was re-released! Silly me...), and at a good price to boot. So how could I NOT give it a shot?\n\nSo, how was it? Well...\n\nOn the one hand, it's certainly a ResEvil game through and through. You play a familiar character running through differing locales slaying undead B.O.W.s with firearms, collecting items and keys, unlocking doors and solving puzzles to make the story progress. As this could best be described as a \"traditional Capcom sequel\" (the same gameplay concept with a few notable improvements; see \"Mega Man\" and \"Street Fighter\" for brighter examples of such), it makes going into the game easier to deal with than one would think. Once you've cut your teeth on the earlier titles before this, you'll know exactly what to do in terms of the mechanics, so that familiarity won't leave you ultimately blind as you wander about, and should any problematic situation befall you you'll know how to take care of it.\n\nBut things aren't COMPLETELY similar; you'll find yourself flitting about through a whole bunch of locations and areas, some more localized than others, and more numerous than before. Many a time you'll be exploring singular places with many different sub-areas to check out (the first half of the game contains at least FIVE of these, all connected to the central hub in their own way). This in itself increases the level of spelunking beyond simply running around one single area gathering goods and unlocking doors. As well, going through the game is remarkably better than before; the respective characters still have the \"tank-style controls\", but here they're much smoother to engage, especially turning. The continued inclusion of the 180 turn and lock-on aiming to an enemy makes the ensuing battles easier and steadier to go through, from your basic zombies to your far-more threatening boss monsters. This is also to be said for the in-game camera which, while still centralized, moves WITH YOU as you putz about instead of locking onto one fixed shot and having you deal with it. While some may say that's not much of an improvement, it is when you consider how difficult it is when fighting enemies \"off-screen\" (so to speak) and exploring a room or hall you happen to be in; you KNOW something's on that bookshelf, but you can't get a good angle to grab it because the camera WON'T MOVE that way! Now it can, and it eases things up in a noticeable way.\n\nAppearance-wise this is pretty good, though not a huge improvement over older titles. The graphics are still blocky and a bit grotesque, but the polygon amount is higher and more evened out this time around, and the added lighting effects are quite convincing. As well, the cut scenes are remarkably well-crafted; characters and settings are rendered far smoother than the actual character models, the use of camera angles, high level of action and post-production effects (slow down, editing, etc) make them very nice to partake in. And the atmosphere in \"C: V\" is plenty rich, containing a good amount of darkness, spooky ambience and jump scares aplenty, adding in the sense of dread and panic we've come to love in our horror-themed games. This ain't no straight-no-chaser gunplay action ala \"Raiden\" or \"Operation: Raccoon City\" (thank the GODS); nope, this is what you've come for when you see the name of the game (again, so to speak).\n\nHowever, for as many good things as I can say about this, I can say just as much when it comes to its bad qualities. In all fairness and respect, this is my least favorite Resident Evil titles for a whole slew of reasons. For one, for as playable and creepy the game is, the visuals are REAL UGLY. There's a weird fog-like effect that renders much of the action on-screen murky and hazy, with a ghosting effect to movement and camera shifting more on par with the Game Boy than the PS2. This makes actually looking at the game somewhat bothersome on the eye and harder to spot enemies, traps, doors and whatnot, as you need to visually focus on the area much more than you really need to. I'm not sure if it was an issue with conversion, and I do hope the Dreamcast original didn't have this problem, but it's still not anything to simply brush under the rug. Beyond that, the feel of the game in itself is pretty messed up; one of the best parts about a ResEvil title is its sense of flow, one action leading, or affecting, another down the line in a genuinely smooth manner, be it an item use, puzzle solving, whatever. \"Code: Veronica\", on the other hand, doesn't seem to have that. It all feels quite fragmented and almost tossed together, at times in an almost game-breaking way. To wit: items Claire puts into the Item Box can be used by Chris later on, so when the story shifts from one character to the next, you may have forgotten to put some much-needed ammo and health goodies for Chris to use when it's his turn. I learned this the hard way (and NEVER KNEW THIS WAS AN OPTION, BY THE WAY...!) when I failed to supply Chris with pertinent items and weapons before a boss fight and almost couldn't get past it as a result. This, in itself, can inadvertently make this the most difficult of the old guard RE games because of it; it's not an easy game to get through as is, but unintentional human error on your part rendering the game almost impossible to complete is...pretty bad, if you ask me.\n\nAlso, using so many differing places can, at times, kill the progressive momentum of going through the game, as it makes back-tracking and treasure-hunting that much more arduous when you have to figure out where the item you picked up in the Palace should be used in the Training Facility to unlock the door in the Prison where you'll find the fire extinguisher coolant you'll need later on in the Antarctic base for the extinguisher you forgot to grab from the security box and place in the Item Box 'cause you didn't think you'd need it after you first used it, thereby making you unable to get the Magnum in that base because you DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS ITEM BOX SPILLOVER FROM CHARACTER TO CHARACTER and...well, you get my drift. Hyperbolic as that sounds, that's exactly the best way to describe the game's flow; it tends to be just all over the place to go through. But still, once you figure it out you can still progress, albeit more annoyed by its machinations than pleased with yourself. A game shouldn't have to punish you like that, after all.\n\nSo all in all, \"Code Veronica\" is a bit of a mess, but all things considered it's not terrible and still plenty scary where it counts. Pretty far from the dreck the series would churn out post-Mikami, I still come back to this on occasion when the urge arises. It just doesn't happen as often as other titles in the series.

While not a terrible entry in the series, it never really took off for me. Sure it was fairly long but it still felt incomplete somehow. Maybe it has something to do with the lack of unlockables and only one ending. In the first Resident evil, you could get a closet key and unlimited rocket launcher. There were also multiple endings. Same goes for 2 and 3. Why not in this? Your guess is as good as mine, there are indeed multiple possibilities.

Limited supplies, lots of puzzles, item management, and zombies.  The limited items creates a tense atmosphere and there are plenty of jump scares.  If you liked any of the previous RE games, you'll probably enjoy the gameplay of this one.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love old school RE gameplay, there are just a few things about this one that are FAR more frustrating than they are fun.\n\nFirst of all, it has way more backtracking than I remember in any other Resident Evil game.  They all have backtracking, but they don't involve you going back and forth across a giant island multiple times.  You cross the island, only to get an item that unlocks a door two screens away from where you started.  I'm not a fan of the plot, which at times gets rather ridiculous.  There are also a lot of annoying enemies.  Bandersnatches are nearly impossible to dodge, as their arms can stretch across an area to smack you, and can jump from level to level.  Getting past them is a chore, and they show up early on in the game (at least it waits til the end to throw Hunters at you).  I recall a few puzzles where I was completely stumped, and upon looking up the solution in a walkthrough, would have NEVER figured it out.  I don't recall any puzzles like that in other RE games.  There is also a room full of moths that plant eggs on your back, which hatch and poison you.  Now, the moths are fairly easy to dispose of (one shot from anything kills them) and the room has an infinite supply of blue herbs, but once the eggs are laid, you can't get rid of them, and they'll hatch in inconvenient places.  Also, none of the bosses are ANY fun.  One boss involves you running down a hallway being chased, but unless you want to lose a powerful weapon for the rest of the game, it's impossible to get past without taking damage.  They also throw you in a room you can't backtrack out of, so unless you actually came prepared and have a relatively close save, you can get stuck.  Another boss has tons of little minion things that push you around and deal near-constant damage.  It makes the battle far too difficult, especially considering the amount of shots it takes to end it.  There are some other minor things, but I won't list them\n\nIf you want traditional survival horror gameplay, then this will provide that.  It is an earlier Resident Evil title, after all.  However, it's incredibly frustrating, in the unfair sort of way.  (Demon's Souls was a difficult game, but one that I thought was fair.  This isn't)  If you want a great Resident Evil experience, go for the Gamecube remake of the original.","summary":"Frustrating old school RE","unixReviewTime":1370390400,"vote":null,"style":{"Platform:":" PlayStation2"},"image":null}

This game is just a huge waste of time compared to the previous games in the series.\n\nThe biggest problem is that (and this is a HUGE problem) if you've already played the first two Resident Evil games, you will probably feel completely bored with Code Veronica and be left with the impression of \"Been there, done that\".  This game was outdated even when it was brand new because it adds absolutely nothing that we haven't already experienced previously.\n\nI *only* recommend playing Code Veronica if you're new to the classic style Resident Evil series (in other words, if you haven't played the mid to late 90's Resident Evil games).\n\nIf you go into this Code Veronica having played the first three RE games, you will be *severely* disappointed because it does absolutely NOTHING new or innovative.  All this game does is progress the story a little bit, but the gameplay itself is stale and pointless.\n\nThe enemy variety is also horrible.  Zombies, dogs, more zombies, more dogs... that sums up the majority of the enemies you will discover in this game, with the addition of an overrated new enemy called bandersnatchers.  Oh sure, the way these enemies can elevate themselves to new heights when you reach the second floor is impressive and somewhat unsettling as far as fear is concerned, but other than that, these enemies do absolutely nothing for me, and they definitely aren't in the same league as hunters or lickers.\n\nSteve is an annoying character too.  I dislike him a lot.\n\nI've seen arguments over which Resident Evil game is better- this one, or Nemesis.  I can *promise* you that Nemesis absolutely smokes this game into a million little pieces.  Nemesis adds progression to the gameplay (such as the ability to make your own ammo) and feels so much better than Code Veronica it's not even funny.\n\nAlso, Code Veronica suffers from WAY too much needless backtracking.  We're talking about a *serious* moment of wandering back and forth here folks, the likes of which never happened in a Resident Evil game before this one was released.  It's definitely quite tedious and unnecessary.\n\nThe game removes the \"still frames\" that were dominant in the previous Resident Evil games, but since the majority of time is being spent walking through previously explored empty areas, this isn't exactly some major, exciting leap in gameplay or anything.  In fact, it doesn't matter at all.\n\nOverall, probably best to avoid this game and pick up Resident Evil 2 and 3 instead (the two best games in the series IMO).","summary":"disappointing and unnecessary","unixReviewTime":1272153600,"vote":"2","style":{"Platform:":" PlayStation2"},"image":null}

It was called RE Code Veronica and it was the next installment, that Capcom gave us, dealing with RE and it's HUGE following. The game pulled off ok in alot of respects because of the obvious graphics and sound improvements. However, for me it just didn't seem to have the same pull that RE 2 or RE 3 did.\n\nNow we look at RE Code Veronia X for the PSX 2, once again Capcom seemed to have an idea of what they wanted us to experience. Graphics and sound aside, which of course were nice, the game didn't seem to have alot of that extra UMPF! that the other games have had.\n\nDon't get me wrong... I liked the game but the reason I have given it a lower rating overall from RE 2 and RE 3 is because I just couldn't pull myself into the original RE CV or the rereleased RE CV X games. I'm thinking maybe it was the fact that by this time I was getting kind of tired of dealing with zombies... like Silent Hill eventually loosing it's steam with \"Disturbing\" images. I was feeling all zombied-out... they just were not scary anymore... but thats for my Resident Evil 4 review.\n\nIn closing I'd suggest getting this game over the original RE Code Veronica for Dreamcast anyday. As for getting this game because you are looking for something \"Scary\" or heartpounding to play... maybe try RE 2 or Silent Hill 2. One last thing, as I have said with Resident Evil 2 and 3 I will not and would not pick those or this title up for the Gamecube, they are nothing more than just a port... not a remake as they should have been.","summary":"The Truth about Resident Evil Code Veronica X...","unixReviewTime":1145923200,"vote":null,"style":{"Platform:":" PlayStation2"},"image":null}

In creating this game, Capcom kept the original formula of RE and threw in a couple twists. Instead of using still shots for every location, the entire game is now rendered in polygons. This allows the camera to follow the action, similar to Dino Crisis (Capcom), and eliminating most of the dubbed \"Bad Camera Angles\".  This also allows players to catch explore more of the area. The down side to this camera in motion approach is that you often times will miss the shimmering object clues programmers give to allow you to find important items. This can cause for some added frustration, but once you adapt to this new view, I am confident you will prefer it.\nThe play mechanics remain for the most part unchanged from the previous installments of the series.  Up still walks forward, down still back steps, any avid video gamer should be familiar with this control scheme. The ability to spin 180 degrees to face an onslaught from the rear has been changed from a simple button press, to tapping back and the run button. This alteration can be cumbersome to use at first, but you soon become accustomed to its uses. Another welcome change is the multi-targeting ability on some weapons. For example, when Claire has the twin machine guns, she can target multiple enemies. This is great for pacifying crowds. My favorite adjustment to play was increased usefulness of the knife. Previously, the knife was used for little more than a last ditch effort, but in RECVX, it becomes a primary choice of weapons for zombies. Precise swipes with the knife can inflict serious damage as well as decapitate zombies.\nThe story is somewhat of a wild goose chase. In the beginning, Claire Redfield (featured in RE2) is trying to locate her brother Chris Redfield (featured in the first RE). Claire is captured by Umbrella Corp. They lock her in a prison on a remote island. The problem is, a helicopter crashes, releasing the T-Virus infected monsters. Claire now has to fight her way off the island. Meanwhile, Chris is in Europe, acting as a member of STARS (STARS is like the SWAT, only better). When Chris finds out that Claire is trapped on the island, he rushes to the rescue. Meanwhile, Steve (a new character to the series) helps Claire escape the island. As the game progresses, Claire keeps going where Chris was, then Chris is right on Claire's heels.  It is just a wild goose chase. The difference between this and the original Dreamcast incarnation is the addition of a 10 minute FMV telling about Albert Wesker's (introduced in RE) escape from the Raccoon City Mansion.  The video does not add to the overall story, but is a fringe benefit for owning the PS2 version of RECVX.\nThe graphical aspects of RECVX for PS2 seemed like a downgrade from the Dreamcast version. Though most of the game holds a dimly lit, eerie feel, in well lit areas, the PS2's anti-aliasing limitations become more apparent. This gives a grainier look to the nicely polished exterior. Enemies have not changed a bit in diversification. If it is a male zombie, it will have a consistent look throughout the game. Hunters look extraordinary this time around. The attention to detail on their lizard like skin is exceptional compared to previous RE titles.\nI wasn't too impressed with the sound effects and background music. The SFX seem to be touched up versions of the previous games, sounding dated against the PS2's power. Capcom's choice of BGM doesn't really add to the feel of the game either. Instead, I usually turn the music off. There's more visual suspense than audio in RECVX. Even the zombies have one cry. It is the same groan used since RE1. I hope for their sake, they put more diversity into the enemies.\nOverall, I did enjoy this game. It is not the graphics or sound that appeal, but the story and feel presented. I rated this game an 8 on the Game Rankings scale. I found RECVX to be amusing, but it falls into the same frustration loop that other games do if you don't have a guide. Either way, this is a good game to own for your PS2. If you don't have a PS2, I recommend owning the original for Dreamcast.","summary":"An interesting change to classic survival horror.","unixReviewTime":1037145600,"vote":null,"style":{"Platform:":" PlayStation2"},"image":null}

RE newbies will find an enjoyable adventure here, but veterans will find it to be treading on very familiar ground. Veterans of the series already know what to expect: monster-blasting action crossed with brain-twisting puzzles, and it does not deviate from that formula either. The narrative follows survival\/horror franchise pros Claire\/Chris Redfield travel from a desert island to a secret Arctic base; both locales are, of course, densely populated by zombies and mutated monsters thanks in part to the G-virus, T-virus (or whatever they seem to be calling it these days). Veronica X delivers a solid stream of shocks and surprises, although some story elements are awkward as the games title puncuation. After a couple of \"romantic\" interludes between Claire and an island prisoner named Steve, you'll yearn for the no-nonsense style of Jill Valentine and RE3.

It has plenty of surprises for the lot of you, and plenty of action to keep you entertained.\nBut for the rest of us, we know the score right? Haven't we heard this story all before? Do you remember Resident Evil 2? What a adrenaline rush that was eh, with plenty of weaponry, scary monsters, and atmosphere to keep any gamer happy.\nCode Veronica (X) doesn't host that much of new material to old fans (such as myself.) Sure, the characters lips move in the \"movie\" sequences, so what? The weapons if nothing else, has been reduced, the action isn't that immence (compare this with Resident Evil: Nemisis (3), and you'll know this.)\nYes, there really isn't that much new in Code Veronica. It's just the same old thing, which gets boring rapidly fast!\nNew gamers, buy code veronica at once. Old fans, if you have played through Resident Evil 3, you've gotten all the action you can handle, and won't need to bother with Resident evil: Code Veroinca X.\nThat was the rough explenation. If you want it in detail, read on:\n\nOK firstly let me just start off by saying that I am a HUGE resident evil fan. Ever since the beginning: Resident Evil, I've been there, shooting at zombies, getting terrified, being compelled by both music, and story. My personal favorite of all Resident Evil games has to be the second one, with the third one being a close encounter. The second game had so many elements that makes a game great, that I don't know where to begin.\n\nNow that the resident evil series has jumped up a platform, what is new? Well, actually, not very much. I must say I got to be a little disappointed with the start of Code Veronica. There seems to be less zombies, and less scary moments in Code Veronica in the other games. So you ask me, why? Well, my guess it, it has to be that this game covers a HUGE area. The first game only took place inside a mansion, whilst in Code Veronica, you get to visit an Island, two seperate mansions, a science complex, oh, did I mention the cave? The game seems to be stripped of that claustrophoc feel, which I consider a must have for any Resident Evil game. Sure, Resident Evil (3): Nemisis did take place in Racoon City, but still, the city looked so closed down, almost like a ghost town. So the claustrophic essence stayed intact in the last game. But here, the wide area doesn't help the game much.\n\nThe graphics are of course better than ever. Now you can actually see the lips moving on the characters, the music too helps a lot, now being on the the quanity note, since there are a lot of themes, but none of them really grasped me as much as the few used in the other resident evil games. Graphics, moving lips? Who needs it! I never considered the movie aspect (that first appeared in Resident Evil 2) that much great. Yes, of course, it is nice to have something extra. But I feel Code Veronica is more like a movie, than a game.\nControlling wise the game is a step backwards. Yes, you can turn 180 degrees like in resident evil 3, but where is the option to jerk away a blow from a zombie? Complitely missing. Even though that was just a chance thing, and not messured by skill, I still think that was a fun addition in Resident Evil 3. Another thing: Why have they censored the zombies? I mean, if you try to use your shotgun, to blow of a zombies head, it won't come off. Why?\n\nMaybe Capcom wanted to grasp a much more wider audience,\nbut, it kind of loses its reallity a bit.\nDon't\nget me wrong, Resident Evil: Code Veronica X is a great game.\nBut if you are a but short on cash, I would opt (if I were you)\nto wait for Devil May Cry.","summary":"Highly OVERATED","unixReviewTime":1003881600,"vote":"7","style":{"Platform:":" PlayStation2"},"image":null}

If, however, like me, you don't regard Capcom's monster franchise as the be-all, end-all of action\/adventure gaming, you may want to give Code: Veronica X a pass. Although the backgrounds are no longer prerendered, the player still has no control over the game camera, which is both puzzling and frustrating. Puzzling, because if the environments are generated in real-time 3-D, why can't the camera be user-controlled? Frustrating for the same reason as any other RE title-it's just plain too hard to see what's going on sometimes. In many rooms, the camera angle is facing the door through which the character enters, making anything outside of that view, including enemies, totally invisible. Often, the only clue to the presence of zombies is their moaning. How is one supposed to aim and fire at something one cannot see? Why should the player not be able to see anything the character can? Another issue continuing from the earlier RE games is the control. How archaic is the old \"rotate-and-forward\" control scheme? Don't even try to do this with the analog stick if you want any kind of precise movement. Thank heaven there are no jumping puzzles in these games. Combat is and has always been a hit-or-miss affair in Resident Evil games, and Code: Veronica X is no exception. Wasting bullets when there are few enough to be had in the first place is supremely infuriating, but often happens because the characters rotate so slowly with their weapons drawn. The silly \"cinematic\" camera angles may indeed be dramatic, but totally useless for any kind of exciting combat. Was it impossible for Capcom to include a control scheme that would move the character in the direction indicated by the controller?\nThe puzzles are actually OK in this installment, as they have at least some rudimentary logic within the game world. For example, there are no mysterious, iconic statues in the middle of a police station, but rather computerized security systems that need to have an ID number input to unlock a door. A metallic symbol must be reproduced in plastic to allow it to pass through a metal detector and then used to unlock a gate. These puzzles add to the realism, rather than detract from it like the sometimes silly ones in Resident Evil and RE 2.\nThe graphics are impressive, especially considering they are done in real-time. The game's art direction is just as clever and beautiful as any other Capcom survival horror game. The music, again, is more of the same, but it feels very familiar and does well to let you feel you are back in the RE world, which is OK. The over sound is good too; 3-D sound effects make locating those out-of-camera-view baddies a little easier. Unfortunately, these superficial qualities just don't do enough to overcome the sameness of the the experience, and don't do ANYTHING to overcome the flaws in gameplay. I think that RE games in general are becoming a little overrated and the series has overstayed its welcome. RE: Survivor was lambasted as being a horrible game, but at least you could see those zombies when you walked into a room full of them. By the way-the Devil May Cry demo is amazing.

His dead wife has lured him back to Silent-hill and you know THAT is not going to be a happy walk in the park.\n\nFirst of all let me say I think this game really made people \"re-think\" the survival horror genre. It tried being witty, intelligent, and chalked with macabre symbolism as opposed to zombie arms that broke through windows. Even the side characters were more than simply devices to move the plot along. Eddie and Angela have their own interesting inner demons too and Maria looks just like James's deceased wife though her personality is drastically different. If that is not enough to sell you on this premise I could simply say \"Oh yeah this game introduces Pyramid-Head\". That alone will have people lining up in droves.\n\nNow putting everything good about the game aside I'm going to be brave and talk about why I think while it deserves \"praise\" it still is not all that and a side order of extra big fries. Yes, I know this is the game the elite Silent Snoots put on a pedestal. The one game no other SH can compare to. The Holy Grail of team silent. Is it that earth shattering?  For me anyway it was not.\n\nAs with the other games there is a suspenseful build up. First it is sounds. Then it is fleeting shadows. Finally it is full blown creatures. The only problem is often there are not enough monsters and instead you are forced to aimlessly wander around trying to collect keys or pieces of an obscure puzzle. Now I admit sometimes its' fun to run around an enviorment without fear of dying to see those little details. However in a survival horror game you should never begin lulling into a calm sense of security and that's the biggest flaw of the game. In most areas I felt \"safe\" and that the monsters were easy to manuever around. Every once in awhile an eager lurching Pyramid-Head made my heart race a bit but besides for the beloved apron adorned big guy no other creatures instilled in me any amount of dread.\n\nThe true disturbing factor comes from interacting with Eddie and Angela. I will not divulge why they are so psychologically unstable but talking with them alone requires a few steel nerves. These are normal people that \"snapped\" and you get the feeling you are a participant in their  horrorifying delusions. Things get stranger when you meet Maria, the sultry Dopple-ganger of Mary who embodies all Jame's sexual fantasies given flesh. Is she Jame's wife's ghost? Sadly Silent Hill never makes an explaination that easy so you have to keep playing to find out.\n\nAs the game slowly drags on it picks up when we find out James has his own dark secret. When you finally get that revelation everything comes together and you know why Silent Hill's foggy streets beckoned to him.\n\nNow there is one thing I like to make clear to the fans. Pyramid Head pursued James because James subconciously wanted to be punished for his past misdeeds however  a few references from the other games prove the executioner has been apart of the town history for a long time. PH was not manifested from James, he was merely drawn to James. This is why it is OK PH was in the movie and ok he is in SH V.\n\nExamples\n\n1. In origins the gillespie house had a picture of PH. Origins took place way before Jame's arrival.\n\n2. The Room talked about \"the red devil\" and Jimmy stone. This story ties into PH if you read it carefully.\n\n3. Another document in Origins talked about \"the executioner\" as well.\n\n4. In SH 3 there is a picture of one of Alessa's past goddess incarnations with PH in the background amongst a few other people. You can view it in the cathedral.\n\nI just wanted to clear that up because there is a HUGE DEBATE raging PH should be confined to only this game which I find to be a waste of breath.\n\nAs you can expect the music in this game is haunting and very befitting of Jame's sad tale and descent into madness to find his redemption. If there is one thing SH 2 gets right it is estabalishing a powerful thought provoking mood.\n\nCombat is what you expect from SH. You are not going to be able to fight like a marine. A plank with nails in it is your first weapon. That should tell you something right there. Eventually you get a few guns and a few other melee weapons besides your buddy \"Plank-zorz\".  Aside from stomping on monsters when they're down you are not a golden glove brawling champion. Perhaps it is for this reason it is good why most of the monsters are so gosh darn pathetic. Besides for the acid spewing of the patient monsters and the sheer size of the abstract daddies nothing made me feel over-whelmed that often.\n\nSo in the end I'll say this game is great for atmosphere and a brilliant story. If you can stomach a horror game with more emphasis placed on wandering around, solving puzles, and talking to crazy lunatics to glean disturbing revelations you can likely over look the fact the combat engine is uninspired and the monsters are more scarce than the items in your inventory.","summary":"Great game if its' unique flavor is indeed your cup of tea.","unixReviewTime":1217980800,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Let me stat by saying that many people believe this game represents one of the finest examples of story telling to have ever graced a video game and I will spoil none of it in my review. The game, in short, combines the creepiness and mood from the first game, with the controlls and graphics of the 3rd. From it's opening scenes, the game draws you in and however horrific and disturbing things get on screen (and at times, they will get very disturbing), the game mearly becomes more addictive. As things go on, you find your self intrigued, not only with the story of the protagonist, but with the history of the setting of the story, the town of Silent Hill (i'm not giving anything away here... the name of the game is silent hill 2, and if you can't make some sort of assumption that the game takes place in Silent Hill, you need not bother with this game at all). like many other survival horrors, this game has fixed camera angles (sort of... you can push a button to put the camera behind your player, but this only works in some areas) that can become a little bothersome at first, but in the end help add to the suspence. It also has corny diolauge, but this can be easilly forgiven, as it does not take away from the mood that the game creates. Next up, this game is not for every one and is not a gore filled splatter-fest, but does feature some blood and several disturbing images that will stay with you for some time to come. I recomend the game to mature players... not only because of it's content, but because of it's story. The game does not spell out any thing for you, and there is a lot of symbolisim (i.e. many things you see hapen arround you, reflect things that have happened in you characters past, or in his mind.... and you have to make this assumption all on your own in many cases, wondering what something symbolises) and the story touches on many \"mature\" issues, such as child abuse, wedding vows, euthanasia, suicide, hommicide, and religion. After all the praise I have given the game, you may be wondering why I rated the orrigional SH2 with only 3 stars. This is because the orrigional game is not nearly as good as the \"Greatest Hits' version for ps2 or the \"restless dreams\" version for x-box (both versions are exactly the same). These versions contain many things that were not included in the orrigional game, such as more endings, more items, more options, and a different playable character, and her own short story\/prolouge that you can play through (lasts about 30 min.s to 2 hours, depending on your skill :-) ) Because of this, the \"greatest hits\" and \"restless dreams\" versions are 5 star games while the orrigional is only 3 when compared to them. Be sure that if you are buying the game for ps2, make sure the box art has a red top, with \"greatest hits\" writen in the red. If you own an x-box, the restless dreams version is the only one availabe for the x-box so don't worry. In conclusion, This is one of the best survival horror games ever released, and scares you in a subtle, creepy way that very few games can. Including an award-winning story, easy to learn controlls, good graphics (The graphics are saposed to look grainy.... after you beat the game once, you can make them smooth and turn off the grainy filter) and a healthy amout of replay value, this is one game that belongs in any survival horror fan's collection. .","summary":"One of the best...","unixReviewTime":1091750400,"vote":"5","style":null,"image":null}

Thompson","reviewText":"Silent Hill 1 was known for its creepy monster array, and its unique use of nightmare-inducing scariness.  Silent Hill 2 is far from the original.  It does make you scared at times, but not to the degree as the original did.  With Silent Hill 2, we are introduced to better looking fog-effects and overall graphics.  Silent Hill 1 managed to do more than 2 does with a lot less...which is what bothers me.\nSilent Hill 2's main attraction for scariness is \"people\" instead of monsters.  What I mean by this is that every person in this game (including you) have your fair share of \"problems\".  There are some people that seem to evolve from normal humans (at the beginning of the game) to downright mentally unstable whackos!  It really makes you think about mankind.  In this edition of SH, you are put in the place of another hopeless guy in search for a loved one, this time its your wife instead of your kid.  I won't give away the surprise ending (even though I guessed it beforehand), but it is pretty wierd and disturbing.\nMy biggest beaf with this game is probably its lack of\/absense of enemies.  What does this mean exactly?\nABSENSE OF MONSTERS:  (example)\nWell, if you played SH1, then you remember the freaky little kid monsters.  Well, they were taken out because the creators thought they were too scary....well, I thought this game was SUPPOSED to be scary so that was a major bummer to me.\nLACK OF MONSTERS:  (example)\nThere are probably 5 monsters (excluding minibosses and bosses) that are re-used and re-used throughout the game.  In the original Silent Hill, there were probably 10+ monsters total that they used (excluding the bosses) sparingly in the game's evolution from normal to downright scary.  This is a big downfall to this game, because you will find yourself in a completely new scenario and fighting the same monsters over and over.\nBut this game is not without its benefits, it is disturbing when it wants to be.  You can't really trust anyone in this game, not even yourself!  Everyone tells you lies and they avoid the truth at all costs.  Even though the original game offered more weapons, this game offers some cool ones (like a sword that is probably the length of a man's body) so its not a total loss.\nTo sum this up, if you are interested in Silent Hill so much that it doesn't matter which one is better, then you should probably get this and judge for yourself.  I bought it for that reason, and I still own it.  Other people that are new to the Silent Hill series should probably play the first before you play this to get a feel on what scary really is.","summary":"Original was better...

However, some of the true excitement of college football is missed. A few college fight songs are in the game, but they're played IN EVERY stadium. It's annoying to hear another college's fight song in your \"home\" stadium. Of course, this means that most college fight songs are not included.\nSecondly, the play-by-play announcers are way off base in many scenarios. (Including calling TCU the \"Mustangs\" and SMU the \"Horned Frogs\", as well as indicating teams have turned the ball over when they haven't.) I wonder if this game skipped the QA process to hit a time deadline?\nIn any event, despite these annoyances, the control and graphics and good, and are modeled after the same in NFL 2K1. In trying to provide an option offense for the college version, Sega *almost* got it right, but the quarterback control during the option is a bit awkward.\nThe game is worth the money if you're like me, and you've *got to have* a college football game, but if you only have a passing interest in NCAA football, I'd recommend saving your money.","summary":"Great graphics, but 2K2 misses some important features","unixReviewTime":999475200,"vote":"5","style":null,"image":null}

And with the several possible game play options, there is a lot to do as far as play and re-play are concerned.\nHowever, the story this time is not very well developed.  And where there is some attempt at plotting, there are sadly few surprises.\nAs with the original game, there is never a complete explanation of the situation.  How did James Sunderland -- the character we play as -- end up in Silent Hill?  We learn that a note from his presumably dead wife inspired his journey but never understand much else about him.  When did he notice the world around him starting to mutate into the bizarre place he visits?  Why does so little of the strangeness around him have an impact?\nThere are plenty of attempts made to creep us out in this game and the enemies are definitely strange and interesting.  The puzzles with their multiple levels of difficulty are also a nice feature.  But, these elements just don't add up to all that they might.\nThis isn't a major disappointment by any means.

A silence wells over the man plodding through the blood dried halls.  Handling a crude pipe and a trusty flashlight as he's only means of protection, James Sunderland goes on.  The impenetrable mist of fog harbors unseen monsters, they hunt him, leaving hints of their presence with distorted cries.  His flashlight emits limited visibility.  He is rapt to find his former love, who supposedly wrote him a letter to convene at the ethereal town of Silent Hill.  A letter she has written from the grave beyond. . .\nWhen my big ol' ears chanced upon the story behind the exaggerated gore game, I was surprisingly head over heels.  Inspired by Hollywood gore-fests and perhaps Resident Evil, Konami's suspenseful game was something to get all school-girl about.  Irresistible screenshots from various zines slapped me in the face, saluting it as revolutionary.  Presenting one devil of a pessimistic setting, Silent Hill 2 looked to have everything going for it; an absorbing story, a mix of hair-raising visuals, and an arsenal of, oddly enough, attractive undead nurses.  Needless to say, I expected a spine-tingling crusade into Hell, and the game delivered just a little too much of unpleasant Hell.  My definition of Hell, you ponder?  First, the apparent dizziness from the camera scheme.  Konami initiated  phase \"super artsy\", incorporating a futile attempt to capitalize on the aspects of horror films.  The last time a director went artistic was the disaster known as \"The Cell ,\" starring the no-talent Jennifer Lopez.  Unfortunately, Konami nearly ranks on \"The Cell's\"  verge.  Secondly, the gameplay identically mirrors the exact setup to its predecessor.  Basically the player must chronologically progress from point A to point B while eluding monsters along the way.  Other than the flashlight and the pipe, there are guns with very limited ammo.  Akin to Resident Evil, the player should conserve ammo and sling em on mutant bosses.  Once you play an hour of Silent Hill 2, you pretty much played the whole thing; player's feel heartbeats stem from the controller, stumble on a grousing oddity playing hide-and-seek in the midst of excessive  fog, scramble from vomiting enemies, flirt or dart away from stalking nurses, collect an item here and there to unlock a door, crack plenty of conundrums, equip your game face for an upcoming boss, and finally, if you`re a vet to the horror genre, you'll  feel the wane of the scare moments.  Corresponding to the rules of the now dreary survival genre, tactical options on gameplay is naught.\nThe only distinguishable difference in Silent Hill 2 to that of its predecessor is the dazzling facelift.  A sheer novelty, the PlayStation 2 refines the graphics to the director's own dark, morbid world.  Konami's underscore has to be the highly polished environment.  Shadowy and stark, the town is heavily congested by indolently flowing fog.  The atmosphere is so detailed that it can probably manifest a life of its own.  There areas where pure darkness shrouds the room with nothing more than a flashlight guiding the player.  Animation on both the characters and monsters are parallel to the fluidity of water.  PS2 harnesses the best facial expressions I have ever seen.  In each CG sequence the mugs on the characters are superbly distinct, showcasing a uniquely designed emotion.  Graphically, Silent Hill 2  has attained an otherwise unreachable ascent, until now.\n\nIn the audio department, there's the fundamental elements found respectfully for this type of genre.  There are downright disquieting silences mainly found in the game.  The music is commonly suspended as the player focuses on the presence of threats by sounds of movement or verbal noises.  The few tracks of music suit and correspond to the mistrustful setting.  Sound effects are wonderfully rendered like the scraping of metal, the shuffling feet, and the bizarre crunches.  Although the sound effects and music are excellent, the voice-overs in the CG sequences have not improved over the original.  Again, the Japanese creators have mistakenly selected incompetent actors who sound insanely cheesy.\nDespite the promise Silent Hill 2 had going for it, the evils of gameplay slipups tarnish its potential.  If Konami were to patch up the wounds on the inescapable camera crisis and append a fresh sheet of innovations, this would have been passed up as the king of the survival genre.  Too bad too.","summary":"Behold, the survival genre wanes","unixReviewTime":1003190400,"vote":"5","style":null,"image":null}

What are those flaws...well I'll tell you.  First off play control is a bit awkward and a bit slow.  The jump button is the right hand trigger, and for big hands that isn't always easy(trust me).  Your X-men also doesn't like to be bothered to run, they crawl.  Rouge has some great animation, but she needs to haul it.  There is a dash move but enemies will hit you if you try to use it to escape.  Enemies will crowd around you. and since there is no defense you're toast.  Not to mention the fact that they can attack you during your attack, making it sometimes impossible to advance in the game.  The sound is terrible.  Tiny punches and \"arrgghh\" when you die.  Bosses don't make any flashy entrances, and they all have the same voice.  Given Game Boy Advances sound potential..someone messed up.  The bosses you encounter are unlocked once you beat them.  You can use them to fight a la street fighter, but you can't fight the CPU.  They are only available via the gamelink.  Great marketing, poor programing.  So if you are interested in any of the game's cool bosses(Jean Grey, Psylocke, Gambit)then get a friend with the game link and another game pack. So what's good about it.  The graphics are great.  The X-Men have great animation and the characters are nicely detailed.  Background graphics are cool too.  Even though they aren't playable in one player mode, the fact that some oool characters are in the game as bosses or mini-bosses is a great idea.

Bollen","reviewText":"Though I am a solid fan of Mobile Suit Gundam and its many spin-offs, I am writing this review as a seasoned gamer and nothing more.  Only the game's content will be discussed.\nIt starts off great: CGI's animate the hundreds of orbiting colonies, the mobilization of the Zeon and Federation forces, an orbital battle sequence, and, finally, Amuro Rey and the Gundam giving a squad of Zakus some serious payback.\nAfter beating the first mission, the game takes a sincere downfall.  Manually aiming and firing the gun is awkward.  One must get up close and personal with the incoming Dopps in order to take them out, either by thrusting directly into them or standing on the White Base in wait.  Destroying enemy Gaws in the third mission requires thrusting repeatedly, landing on top (which is painfully difficult at times) and wrecking it from there.\nMost of the Gundam fans out there defend the controls as being authentic and true to the show.  That's all well and good with a game like Silent Hill 2, where the player assumes the role of James: a depressed widower with little or no combat experience.  Thus, the controls are strange and clunky, in order to give the player some feeling of how James isn't used to swinging clubs and firing guns.\nHere's the trade-off.  While combat is only used when absolutely necessary and performance ratings are nonexistent in Silent Hill 2, ALL of the goals in J2J involve fighting and performance is graded based on remaining life, defeated enemies, time taken, etc.\nLet it also be known that fans are optimistic in saying that one gets used to the controls.  With ANY game, the player soon memorizes button functions and special moves.  This does not make the controls respond better at all, though.  Being on the receiving end of a beam weapon while trying to dash away makes one want to hurl the controller across the room.  All of the moves listed in the instruction manual (except for the sequential saber slash) are difficult to execute, take time, and are not worth the effort in the end.  Strafing while using the rifle, bazooka, or hammer is the best strategy at any and all times.\nIf anything, rent or borrow the game, find a good strategy guide, and play through it once, like I did.  The CGI's and animated cutscenes are done well and fun to watch.  The mobile suit specs, movies, and music tracks in the gallery are worth checking out.  In short, the gameplay suffers while everything else is thoroughly enjoyable.  Bad gameplay is, however, totally unacceptable, which is why I only give this game an average rating.\nOn a final note, it ticks me off that the first good Gundam game on the PS2 is one in which the player fights on the Zeon side.","summary":"Worth playing through once.","unixReviewTime":1026000000,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

But when you play the harder missions where you really need to be able to control your mech, the controls are absolutely useless.\nThe sound effects are very good. But when the game attempts to mix music, sound effects and voice overs at the same time, it quickly becomes unintelligible. I found myself switching off the music immediately.\nOnly buy this game if you are a really big Gundam fan and really like to see a 3D model of a Gundam run around. I remember watching Gundam 0079 when I was a kid and so this game is nostalgic for me. But if you have played many of the other PS2 mech games, and are not a Gundam fan, then pass by or rent this title, and wait for the Zeon Front title to come out.

It's still mostly recognizable, but very differant.\n---Boss names now reflect the names they had in the Arcade.\n---There's a new pickup item that allows for temporary invulnarability.\n---There are secrets to be unlocked for destroying bad guys: Street Fighter Alpha versions of Guy and Cody, Number of Lives select, stage select, and other such things.\n---Graphics have also been tweaked slightly.\n---Where as the SNES version only threw three or four baddies at you at a time, the GBA version will positively swarm you unless you're set on easy level.\n---Most importantly, they added the Industrial Area level that was missing in the original SNES version And of course they have Guy, which many people missed the first time.\nWhat's the same:\n---It's still the same game.

If you missed out on the SNES version, I'd definetaly get it.

There is something compelling about the game, but yet it has so many flaws that advancing in the game seems more like work than like fun. For one thing, there's a lot of tasks that must be performed in order to advance to the next stage - typical of this type of game, but the tasks in this game seem to be laborious rather than simply challenging or fun. And as other reviewers have criticized here, it's just way too easy to die in this game - not from anything you really did wrong, but because of poor camera angles and touchy controls. And I really hate the one rifle with the multiple attachments. I much prefer to just have different weapons with a shooter\/adventure game - shotgun, rifle, pistol, etc. not all in one weapon with confusing attachments where you must constantly go to the menu to change attachments.\n\nOne of the most annoying aspects of this game is when you are moving down a dark corridor, the only way that you can see what is in front of you is to point your rifle with the flashlight attachment in front of you. This makes it impossible to move through some areas fast. Plus, there isn't a lot of ammo for some sections, which means you just end up running away from enemies - which works way too much of the time!!\n\nI have played quite a few of these types of adventure games now and I must say that this is the worst voice acting of any game I've played. Absolutely dreadful - seriously! The inflection and timing is so off, it makes you wonder if these people are actual English speakers. Or perhaps the Japanese staff that made the game were standing over their shoulders telling them how to say or pronounce the lines in English....hahaha....And the voice actor for the main character sounds like he's either 12 or gay - and this is a Marine, right?!\n\nI do like the sound effects for the game. It definitely has a creepy feel to it. The graphics are not good enough to make it scary - the graphics are pretty sub-par but this was a 2001 release - but it's creepy none-the-less. However, despite all this the game is not a total flop - but it gets tiresome to complete because it always felt like I was having to do some particular set of tasks just to move on in the game rather than enjoying the journey of the game itself.

Even though the game is quite fun, I probably prefer the original. Here's why:\n\n- First of all, the amount of cutscenes in this game are *incredibly* high. I'd say you have TWICE as many cutscenes to deal with in this game compared to the original. True, these cutscenes might end up telling a good story (if you actually have the patience to watch them all) but it doesn't really excite me on a personal \"overall video game experience\" level. Years from now the only thing I will remember about Sons of Liberty will be all the cutscenes I had to sit through, or skip (if I chose to do so). To make matters worse, many times I'm interrupted with spoken conversations during critical moments where I REALLY can't afford to be interrupted, such as during a moment when I'm trying to find the best way to eliminate a guard blocking an important path. I can't be distracted during these moments, and that's a shame. This was never a problem in the original.\n\n- Sons of Liberty is just about the same length as the previous MGS game (if you choose to skip all the cutscenes, that is). I'm serious. A sequel is ALWAYS supposed to be a longer and more interesting game. However, this is not the case with the Metal Gear Solid series. I can beat this game in 2 hours and 30 minutes. I can beat the original in 2 hours and 20 minutes. So it's only about 10 minutes longer overall. I'm not happy about that at all.\n\n- The very reason the original Metal Gear Solid is a much better game overall is because of this- the boss fights. In Sons of Liberty you only have 5 or 6 boss fights total, and none of them are very creative or interesting. What's up with that? One fight has you shooting between crates trying to locate and eliminate the enemy. It's fun, but not THAT great. Certainly not sequel-worthy, in my opinion.\n\nAnother boss fight has you running from the first to second level shooting stingers at the enemy. This is sort of fun. Another boss fight has Snake diffusing bombs. I don't particulary care for this one because for the majority of the first half of the game it seems like you're going around making sure bombs don't go off in certain places. I don't want to continue doing the same thing during a boss fight. It also seems like there's an exceptionally long period between the first and second boss fight.\n\nIn the original you had up to 11 or 12 boss fights, and they were more creative than the ones here, too. You had a helicopter battle, a sniper fight where you had to guide missiles through a winter forest to find the sniper, a battle with a large army tank, a fight with a ninja, a really fun fight with a HUGE mechanical robot where you were required to take down the big thing with stinger missiles, and more. The boss fights in Sons of Liberty come up short and feel uninspired compared to the original Metal Gear Solid.\n\nHowever, the one thing this game does better is that the guards you encounter are MUCH smarter this time around. You can't just walk by them- they will easily see and kill you if you dare to attempt that. This game encourages you to find the correct way to deal with each of the guards that happen to be in your way. Sometimes you have to stun them, and drag them out of the way because other guards might walk by and spot their dead bodies, and then suddenly a search for you will go out, which would then require you to find a way to get out of there and FAST. Smarter enemies in this game are certainly a nice welcome, and probably the only thing about the game worth mentioning.\n\nSome people say that walking around in first-person view makes this game better than the original Metal Gear Solid, but I don't buy that because it seems like EVERY game nowadays has a first-person view. The original was unique.\n\nStick with the first Metal Gear Solid game if you are given a choice between the two. It's more exciting, and thankfully doesn't feature an overkill of cutscenes in all the wrong places. That's where Sons of Liberty fails, unfortunately. Too many unnecessary interruptions. Still, it's a pretty good game. Just not the \"major improvement\" we were led to believe.","summary":"not too good","unixReviewTime":1161388800,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

This is a counter-espionage game that relies more on your ability to conceal yourself than running around the place blasting the hell out of anything that moves (which you can do too if you want). For this reason the game becomes very realistic and the graphics and sound are all too genuine and do not make you feel anything less than actually being there doing what the character is up to at that point in time. The world that you are immersed in has rain, sun and smoke and bad guys patrolling the area. You have both hyper-realistic 1st person views and a third person overhead view as you run around the place. The amount of moves and their combinations are staggering and the actual movement of the character is unparalleled by any game of it type. Watch as you throw your character over a railing and move along the pipe with your hands while dangling over a huge ocean. Let go and watch in horror as you fall to your death. Amazing! The plot is coherent and there is plenty of story to boot but.......... the game design itself is terrible, terrible, terrible.\nMGS2 is by no means a disaster but unfortunately tries too hard to be a movie and less a game. The truth is that the vast majority, over 85%, of the game is spent watching video clips instead of gaming which is really what we want to do and is the reason why we bought MGS2 in the first place. There are so many video sequences in this game that all of the above suddenly crashes back down to the reality of holding a controller and watching the television screen as some video plays itself out. Sure you can skip it, but then two minutes later you find yourself back holding the controller and watching yet another video.... argghhh.... The other two major disappointments is that the game only takes place in ONE LOCATION - an oil rig, but it is huge! The other is that there are far too many calls and dialogues to go through on your communicator. Fans of the series may also not like the fact that the main protagonist in the first game has been replaced - however this is acceptable and does not detract from the experience.\nIn short this is one of the most hyper-real games that you will ever play - the graphics are nothing short of stunning and the character moves are out of this world - but it is all marred by the terrible amount of video clips that you have to sit through. In short this detracts from the overall gaming experience and you will soon get bored with it. Play MGS2 -- ONLY --  if you have the time and the patients to sit through a three minute video every other minute of game play.","summary":"Hyper-realism marred by too many cut scenes...","unixReviewTime":1069200000,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

First let's start with the gameplay: I've never been a huge fan of this franchise to begin with and while I do like how the game mixes things up some times by introducing different styles of play, I have never found it that rewarding. I also think that the guards (enemies) are ridiculously stupid, I mean you can actually stand about ten feet in front of a guy and he won't notice you. How are you supposed to feel good about your stealthing abilities if the guards are that stupid. Don't get me wrong I do like this game, in fact I liked this game in some ways that apparently other gamers didn't. Which brings me to the next part of the review, the story: The word on this game is that it has a bad story, now I don't think the story is the problem; my main grip was with the script. I thought the script was at most times just plain lame. The stuff with Raiden's girlfriend Rose is especially horrible and comes pretty close to ruining the game completely. It's just so utterly bad, the dialog seems to have been taken from a romance novel that was written by some pubescent teenage girl. But beyond the script I thought the overall story was actually pretty good. That said let's get to the final part of my review, which is the graphics: MGS 2 probably shines best in this category. I think the visuals are very good and this is coming from someone who is reviewing this game about a full year after it's original release. The shadow and lighting effects are quite impressive and the character models are great, I also appreciated the amount of detail put into generally every aspect of the levels. My only real complaint about the graphics is with were you spend most of your time in the game, the off shore treatment plant. In my opinion the tanker level, which you start on while playing as Solid Snake, was much more appealing. I found the plant to be a little bland quite frankly and also somewhat boring. It seems to me that the developers spent a lot more time on the much shorter tanker portion of the game and kind of skimped out on the vastly longer lasting treatment plant part, and I'm not just talking about the graphics ether, I'm talking about virtually every aspect of the game.\n  To some up my general opinion of this videogame I think I'd say that it's a lot like a big Hollywood blockbuster; it had a lot of hype surrounding it that it probably didn't live up to, it had great special effects backed by a questionable script, and it defiantly made a lot of money. Also like a big Hollywood movie there's probably a lot of better stuff out there that you're going to miss. But that said I still enjoyed this title and can't say that I wouldn't go out and bye the next one. (and there will be a next one) I guess as a man who appreciates a quality, well rounded game it has become sort of a guilty pleasure.\n\n  Three stars!","summary":"A Game Of Many Contrasts","unixReviewTime":1038787200,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

A year of waiting brought us Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty.  I have always had the opinion that Metal Gear would be better served as a movie and for the most part Sons of Liberty is mostly movie.  The grpahics are outstanding and the gameplay is nicely done but there should have been more play and less movie.  For periods of up to twenty minutes you are beaten over the head with movies and dialouge.  The vioce acting is good, but with such a good game engine, why would you want to show all those pesky cut-scenes.  Grant it, you can skip them but you may find yourself not knowing what to do.  The stealth element of Metal Gear 2 is outstanding.  You can hide in everything from lockers to boxes.  You will also find that the time when you are playing, that Metal Gear's camera is pretty helpful, in most cases.  Sons of Liberty is easier then the original Playstaion game and does boast a better storyline.  The question is, does it have to much storyline?  Well I believe so.  I enjoy playing this game but it is easy to get turned off by the semingly constant cut-scenes.  Metal Gear Solid 2 is a solid game but it is not as great as all the hype you hear.  Undoubtably, this is not a game of the year contender, when compared to the masterpiece that is Grand Theft Auto III, even though they are different types of games.  This is dissopointing when you think about how long Playstation fans have been urning for an award-winning sequel.  The bottom line is the gameplay is great once you learn it. Once you wade through the movie you find a good game that is at least worth renting for the weekend, or if not buying it.","summary":"Is Metal Gear Solid 2 Really All That Solid of a Game?","unixReviewTime":1019174400,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Uhmm, no.  This game has great gameplay, but gameplay is only part of the game.  The rest is dominated by a horrible movie.  When I first popped it in, I was all excited.  Trudging through the fake weapons, the plot of characters I could care so little, the tired excuses to show artwork, just zapped all that.  The first two hours literally consists of 15 minutes of play.  No joke or exaggeration.  Of course, that's only the tip of the iceberg.  There are so many long drawn out interruptions that it ruined the rhythm of what would have been a good, though not great game.\nDuring the few interludes where you can actually play, you get to see a good game.  Even though I wish the movements and game was faster, it still combines many elements of platform, adventure, and first person shooter ups.  You have to use stealth, accuracy, thought, and quick reflexes to pass this game.  The very base of gameplay makes it enjoyable\nI do have some troubles with the controls.  First off, and this is picky, the X button should never, ever, be the abort button when it comes to the front end!  Every other game on earth uses it as the enter button to navigate menus, but not this game.  There are so many times where I was about to save it, only to be aborted for pressing X.  Also, swimming controls are just plain backwards and clumsy.  I struggled through the swimming scenes purely because of this.  Also, there are other things, like you'd be walking, and all of sudden you'd be flat against a wall just because you turned away from the wall.\nThe general feel I got from the game was that all the effort was made to make it a movie, and then add the game as a side note.  There are only two parts, a ship, and a large complex.  The ship takes only an hour to finish, and the complex consists of about 10 structures that are pretty much similar.  That's it.  No complex environment, no contrasting views.  Basically, 80 percent of the game play takes place in gray metal rooms.\nPros:\nGreat gameplay\nCombines action, stealth, and puzzles\nCons:\nAwkward controls (x button, swimming)\nToo many movies\nYou will yell \"Shut up\" many times at your TV\nLack of variation in environments\nTime: 12 hours\nFrustration: High (mostly from the interruptions)","summary":"Shut up already!","unixReviewTime":1017532800,"vote":"8","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

It's very mis-leading, I mean yeah it had the Tanker scene but it was like 20% Snake compared to the rest of the game, The Plant (which is the 80%) consists of this..... Raiden character, that nobody knows or and has nothing to do with Metal Gear sequels, I'm sorry to slam Raiden and all but it's the truth though, and it's the primary reason why sequels don't get very far is because they change and add in new crap to *supposedly* seem more beefed than it's prior segment, ...very similiar to the Resident Evil anthology, it just gets more ridiculous with every follow-up, but anyway, the story-line was fine except for as you get closer to the end, then it gets horrindously ridiculous, like the fight with the Harrier aircraft, and as well as MGS-1's Hind-D you had to fight, I'm sorry to say this but it only takes one Stinger Missile to take down your target no matter where you hit at on an aircraft, not 13-17 missiles as they require on this game, anybody knows what an Anti-Aircraft missle is capable of,  or like the Codec call you get from The Colonel before you engage in the final fight the story he gives just ruins what the meaning of MGS-2's purpose was to begin with, and the ending was even worse, but I'm not going to ruin it for anybody, you will just have to see up's and down's of this game yourself, but I will say the game was actually 10x better than MGS, the set-up of it was great, there are so many cool things you can do in this that will make MGS seem like a Carbon Copy, like for instance you can hold up a guard and do terrible thing to him like aiming at his uhm.... well you know, and he will give you his Dog Tags, or you can shoot him in the arm or leg to make him take you more seriously, also in certain portions of the game when you are playing as Raiden, when you meet up with Snake you will soon figure out that you can irritate Snake by aiming at him or sticking a *supposedly* nude magazine down in front of him (FUNNY!) but it's not as funny if you are a veteran of MGS being that all these stunts were already played out and done toward Meryl Silverburgh, also when you irratate or actually shot at Snake, go into Codec mode with him and he will give you an earful (haha) the down side of it though is he will retaliate if you fire at him, but you can't blame him given that he barely knows Raiden throught the entire game, also the Alert\/Evasion\/Caution was done extremely well, it's more realistic if you play on Extreme mode, anyway, this is a fair game but I wouldn't make the mistake of buying it like I did, instead.... just rent it :)","summary":"It was *okay* it deserves 2 \/ stars","unixReviewTime":1009065600,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

My friends and I just beat it, and it took us 13 hours. BUT, about 10 of those hours were a giant movie that had one of the trippiest stories ever. Metal Gear Solid 2 started out awesome with Snake infiltrating a tanker trying to gain information about Metal Gear (much like the other Metal Gear games), but then the story gets really weird.\nFor those of you who enjoy regular American military games, stop playing after you beat all of the tanker mission because after you beat that, this game turns into some weird Japanimation Manga story with some messed up twists and dialogue that totally seems like the plot did not translate well from Japanese at all. Your are not even Snake for most of the game, you're some guy named Raiden, and no one tells you what the heck is going on. You just do what needs to be done, then the plot takes another messed up twist, and you do something else.\nThe story even does some crazy stuff like tell you about morals and family values. At one time, while you are playing as Raiden and walking around naked trying to kill guys, your contact starts wigging out and saying crazy stuff. He even blatantly told us to turn off the game, we'd been playing for too long, and we might damage our eyes! \"What the Hell!?\"\nOh, the game also made sure to tell us about the differences between killing in real life and in a video game. I have no idea why it did this since you spent most of the game watching a lot of computer generated movies rather than killing people!\nDon't get me wrong, when you actually do get to play the game, the game play and graphics rule. Too bad you only get to actually play for 3 or 4 hours, and less than half that time you play as Snake. I can't believe they even tried to pass this game off as Metal Gear. This should be a Metal Gear parallel story, sort of like VR missions.\nI gave this game 3 stars simply because the beginning where you are actually Solid Snake sneaking around the tanker trying to find the new Metal Gear is really awesome. That portion of the game deserves 5 stars. YET, the other 60-70% of the game\/movie deserves only 1 to 0 stars for being so weird. I MEAN YOU DON'T EVEN PLAY AS SNAKE FOR HALF THE GAME!!!! That would be like playing a Legend of Zelda game as some new character that we've never heard of before. I am still in shock at how dumb the story sounded as the game progressed.\nIf you are truly a Metal Gear fan, you might not enjoy this game and find it too trippy and weird for your taste, but if you like role-playing games with crazy twists that don't make sense in the end, buy this game now.\nI may have a limited view of this game after beating it on easy the first time, but the simple truth about this game whether you agree with anything I said above or not is that most of the game is completed through computer generated animation and movie sequences. You really don't get much game-play out of this game. SURE it's DVD video and cool and all, but IF I WANTED A DVD I WOULD HAVE RENTED A DVD!!!\nAlso, at one point in the game, the President of the United States of America grabs the main character in the crotch and says, \"So, you are a man.\"...Now, they may do that on some weird Japanese cartoons, but here in America, the President should be a no nonsense guy, and not some crotch-grabbing sissy who sells out the country.\n\"What the Hell!?\"","summary":"Why wasn't this game written by Americans!?","unixReviewTime":1008374400,"vote":"26","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

The new abilities that you have(peeking and shooting around corners, guard captures and body hiding) make for a more realistic experience when coupled with the really good graphics. However, (as many have already have noted) you only get to play as Snake for about the first hour. After that, you play as Raiden, a rookie FOXHOUND operative who knows very little about the operation that he is engaged in. Actually, Raiden is somewhat of a dork. I mean, here he is, up to his eyeballs in AK-74 toting baddies, and he allows his girfriend to  call him and ask those lame \"what are you thinking about\" type questions. SHEESH!! Anyway, everyone assumes that Snake was killed (YEAH RIGHT!!!) during the first chapter of the game. Eventually you find that he is in fact alive, and posing as a Navy SEAL, along with our old (geeky) pal, Otacon. Later, we also find that Otacon's sister is more annoying than her brother, and the cyborg ninja isn't Gray Fox back from the dead, but a Russian woman named Olga who has hairy armpits. Eventually, Otacon's sister buys the farm, Ocelot gets away (again), and Col. Campbell turns out to be a figment of Raiden's imagination. All of this culminates in a goofy ending that makes us all go, \"what was that?\" If I gave the story away, I'm sorry! BUT...The good features of the game are again, great graphics, intense and (for the most part) realistic action, and of course, the need for stealth. Now, the bad (even more so than what I described before). The cutscenes are VERY long, and you tend to get confused quickly. The story is somewhat preachy, and you get a little tired of it. I mean, if you wanted a happy little world where everyone lives in a log cabin and picks flowers all day, then why are you playing a game where quietly decapitating dudes with a silenced .45 SOCOM is so important? The ending was rather vague, and the overall plot was a little on the lame side. HOWEVER... Metal Gear veterans will probably like this game. The controls are the same as the PSX's MGS (with a few small changes), and Raiden does take some getting used to. But, I guess that's life. Anyway, this game's good outweighs it's bad, and overall, it is an enjoyable game to play.

I went so far as playing and beating all formats of the original Shadowman because I loved the extremely horrific\nand macabre storyline. So I have to admit that I was a little dissapointed that the content of Shadowman 2econd coming seemed a little \"watered down\".Walking through the adventure of 2econd Coming reminded me more of a slightly darker version of Zelda\nrather than walking through the demonic(sometimes Satanic),\nblood coated,on the verge of apocolypse hell of the first installment. Of course if the first one freaked you out too much, or you're an obsessive censorship buff,then this might be a good thing.....I myself was dissapointed.\n The game is far from a failure though as it was great to have Mike,Nettie and Jaunty back on my tv screen! This game takes place\na few years after Michal Leroi\/Shadowman destroyed the infamous demon Legion and saved the world from apocolypse. As the game progresses we learn that several diffrent cults of demon worshippers and demons themselves are preparing to ressurect their \"leader\"(I guess Legion was just a general or something?)\nfrom \"The Pit\" aka Hell(again another example of how I think this game was censored)to destroy the world,which was found out by information of former NYPD wheelchair-bound cop named Thomas Deacon(remeber Deacon's File that Nettie gives you in the first Shadowman game?Yeah,that's where he comes from!)Again I have to stress that while playing 2econd Coming,I just didn't ever get the feel of it being on the verge of Omega as I did in part one,\nand there was never a sense of terror simply by moving around in certain parts of the game(How many hairs on the back of your neck stood up when you were stumbiling through the darkness of the Birdman's tenant in Shadowman 1??)There was nothing like that\nin 2econd Coming.\n While the voice acting was still good in 2econd Coming,with the return of the same actors from the original who played Michal\/Shadowman and Jaunty(I love that accent!) it wasn't AS good. First of all because the actress who played the sexy,Miss Cleo-ish,Jamican accent of the voodoo mambo Nettie in part 1 was now replaced with someone else who wasn't nearly as convincing..NO ACCENT MAHN!!(Wait a minute...did I just use \"sexy\" and \"Miss Cleo\" in the same sentence??)I can only assume the reason why is because perhaps she died in real life?The game opens up with \"In Memeory of Angela Atikinson 1972-2000\"It's the only reason that I could figure out being the fact that the same Mike and Jaunty actors returned. Also,Michal Deacon's voice sounded,well,kinda stupid. Not that a New Yorker accent is bad(he's an NYPD officer!)but the actor sounded more like a guy who was TRYING to have a New Yorker accent and failing very badly. Another let down;Jaunty only has four scenes!\nONLY FOUR SCENES??He's hiliarious! Why only four scenes?Fans of the original Shadowman will recogonize the voice of the greater demon in the opening cinema as the voice of Legion.\n While the voice acting wasn't as good,the gameplay rocked!!A key\npart in it all?Weapons automatically locked on enemies,and with Mike being able to hold a gun in each hand???Well,you can already imagine! Inventory was also alot more manangable,but what\nI hated about the controls was the fact that R1 and L1 buttons were used as your punch\/fire buttons which took awhile to get used to. The only real annoyance I had with the control was that every time you fell into water\/blood the weapon you had equipped would become transparent even after you switch hands. In short you\nwould have to take off the wepon completely and then re-equip it\nto get it to \"register\" in the game;making it an extreme pain when you fought the demon boss in Russia over a nice big lake of ice water! The game was great in showing the needed relationship between Micheal Leroi and Shadowman as you can switch back and forth between the two personas with a pocketwatch.

The blue hedgehog and his pals simply do not belong in a 3D world and I was more than eager to get this game as it is a return to good old days of Sonic's previous incarnations on the Genesis.\n\nEverything you would have liked about the old Sonic is back. The level designs, the power-ups, the cool music and gameplay that next-gen consoles lacked.\n\nHowever fun the game is to play, it doesn't have much replay value. There are secret entrances in every level to the special stage and I only found one of them. Sorry, but I'm not going to replay every level looking for the special stages. The special stages themselves are kinda hard and there's no way I'd be able to get through all of them.

It's great fun exploring the vast urban and suburban environments, collecting icons, knocking down fire hydrants and, in general, causing mayhem. Despite its flaws, this title has spunk.

Relationships had a base level, they went to their jobs, and entertainment was calling someone and inviting them over, or watching tv.  Livin' Large gave them more things tp play with, House Party gave my Sims something to do besides watch t.v., and Hot Date fills in everything you could possibly want.\nHot Date can complicate things. Instead of meeting another Sim, talking with them, complimenting them, talking some more and then hugging them to make a family friend, you now have two meters on your relationship scale.  You have the long term and daily meters, which means it takes longer to make good friends or fall in love.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it means you have more work before your Sims are good friends or lover.  The added abilities are nice too, they can shake hands or wave to greet someone, there's a bunch of goodbye options, and they're no longer limited to just talking, they can talk about interests, or just gossip. Also, Sims have interests, so they can find common ground with other Sims. It would be nice if you could pick each Sim's interest, but there doesn't seem to be an option for that.\nThis is definitely a more adult game, as there's intimate kisses and hugs, there's a cuddle option, and a blond bombshell in downtown.  The downtown is interesting, there's a lot for a Sim to do, and you can change it to look however you want.\nOverall the new complexity and a seriously long load time make this my least favorite add-on.  I don't mind some of the added complexity, but this is going way overboard.  After a while it gets tiring to try and keep friendships just so, and to invite someone downtown for fun.  It takes the realism a step too far, from being a game (or toy as Maxis calls it) where you can direct things, and makes it more of a realism simulator, although the Sims don't seem to learn or get smarter as the days goes on.\nThe load time really bothers me, with Livin' Large and House Party, my Sims take close to 4 minutes to load, without viewing the introduction. Also, when I create a new neighborhood and check out the downtown, it takes several minutes to create it.  My computer isn't all that fast, at 1GHZ, but it's still irritating to have to wait as long as I do for it to load, especially if I'm only checking something or get called away from my computer.","summary":"Hot Date can complicate things","unixReviewTime":1017446400,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

The game is definately fun in the aspect that you can go downtown to talk and hang out, but that is where the challenge starts.\nIn the previous sims games, as well as this one, relationships are needed to help you stay happy, move ahead in your job, etc. But in \"hot date\" the relationship aspect is twice as hard to build. You can fall in love with somone in the morning, and by the end of the day they won't even like you. That is the drawback of this game, plus friends are twice as hard to make, and take twice as long.\nWhile you can go on dates downtown, the people are a lot harder to get to know.

The addition of the downtown lots gives your Sims a kind of second life and a new way to meet friends or hang out with old buddies.\nThe new social interactions--and there are a LOT of them--add tons of humor and COOL to an already very slick title.

Or have a picnic? Or take a date downtown to try on some new lingerie? You can do all this and more. This expansion delivers at least as much as it promised. It's hilarious, it's engaging, it's a hell of a lot of fun.\nBut it's also broken. When you install Hot Date (if your CD-ROM drive can even read the disc), certain items from Livin' Large (if you have it) will disappear completely, Sims will get stuck sitting on the couch, Sims will forget to go to work, any music playing downtown will become garbled, the game will crash or fail to recognize the CD, and a number of other glitches, major and minor, will have you pulling your hair out.\nYou definitely want to get this expansion, but you should keep your eye on The Sims web site and wait until there is a patch announced.

Madden football games have always been the best (except '94 & '95 on SNES). Madden 2k2 has the best graphics, decent gameplay, franchise mode is the best, but the biggest problem with this and every other Madden on PS and PS2 is the passing.\nThe passing is extremely difficult on every level except rookie. Even as the all-Madden team playing an NFL Europe team, my best receivers could NEVER burn their d-backs which had pathetic ratings of 66 or lower. If there is a defender within 5 yards of the receiver and the receiver makes the catch, HE WILL DROP IT!!! About 90% of the time to be exact. Even if he catches it and moves upfield (which is more of a fumble), he WILL be hit and the ball pops out. It doesn't matter what reciever (Rice, Keyshawn, Rod Smith) anyone and everyone drops the ball nearly everytime they are hit.\nAlso the computer can be shut down for 99% of the game, but then at random cannot be stopped no matter what you do. They simply run right through any defense you throw at it.

If you own Madden 2001 for the PS2 and are considering buying the 2002 version, rent it first.  There aren't very many significant improvements over 2001.  The 2 biggest that I've noticed thus far are that the wide receivers have more catch animations this year.  You're not getting the same pirouette that was the standard catch motion for the receivers in 2001.\nThe 2nd thing I really like is that you can now save a game in the middle.  This has come in very handy.\nBut some of the things in 2002 (and many other recent selections from EA Sports) signify, at least to me, that EA Sports is resting on its laurels...\n* Returning punts is nearly impossible.  In order to do so, I've had to pull a tackle off the line of scrimmage and run him back to block for my guy.  The guys on the outside blocking the gunners simply give up.  They just let the defenders on through.\n* Gameplay needs some attention.  I am lucky to register one sack a game, but the computer wil routinely sack my QB 3-4 times a game.  This is in spite of the fact that my lines are rated much higher than the computer's lines.\nThose are just a few things.  The Madden series continues to dominate the arena of football games for consoles, but I've begun to think this is by default.

Well, if I wanted to throw 37% and an interception per game, I'd go play myself.  Video games are about allowing you to play like Joe Montana, not Joe Schmoe.  To add insult to injury, the computer will absolutely pick you appart at least 2-3 drives per game, where NOTHING you do will stop them from completing 5 passes in a row en route to a TD.  Even with a 99 rated secondary, the worst NFL teams will still carve you up for 250 yards plus.

I also have a 800mhz CPU which I tested it on. This game is the best current football sim. That said, it is not a great sim, but a good one. It has huge glaring flaws in some of the physics. And EA Sports is quite unreceptive to comments about things other then crashes. In other words, if it runs it's good enough. This is an unfortunate stance.\nGraphics: (A-) Very good. Not flawless, but very well done. The weak points in the graphics would be the stadiums. The score board is just a drawing. The crowd and the players on the sidelines are just obvious flat, badly draw, 2d art. The catching, fumbling, and other things involving character animation is not well done. But more or less acceptable.\nSound: (C-) Ok but redundent. The number of different comments John Madden & Pat Summerall do is very very limited. You will hear the same exact comment a dozen or more times in a game. Quite dull. The stadium sound is decent. But the thing I miss the most is the taunting.  Last years model had the funniest things the players would say.  It added a nice bit of color which is sadly missing.\nPlay design\/Play book: (F) This feature was present in last years model.  And while it was weak last year, at least it was there.  There is no playbook customization or play design of any kind this year.  Very disappointing!\nGame Play: (C-) The computer cheats badly (and obviously) and eny level of difficulty. This can be balanced with the sliders, but by default should this be needed?\nOther areas such as pass rush, QB skill, etc can NOT be balanced with sliders since any movement has no discernable impact.\nWith patch 2.21 this part is better.  Not perfect, and not really tweakable with the sliders.  With default settings, pass rush is still NIL, QB's have an easier time going deep then passing short, etc.  I think the most annoying aspect is that hitting the QB 20+ times in a game has no impact on his ability to play.  It would seem that the QB being pummled should have at least some reduction in his skill.\nFranchise mode:(C-) It works mostly. However the draft is heavy skewed towards just a few positions. Everyone in the league will soon have an all star TE or 3, and more FB's then you can shake a stick at. The trading module is pretty broken. The computer will never offer a trade. The computer teams pretty much don't sign free agents either. Want to help the computer?? Sign a bunch a free agents and trade them to the computer teams for low draft picks.\nPlayer movement is too limited.  Players seldom have comeback seasons, or the such.  If they are young and deemed to have potentional they can, and typically will, improve.  However there is no in season learning.  There is no moving from position to postion.  Want to play Rod Woodson at corner like the good old days?  He will only play there with out of position penalties.  It is not  uncommon to draft a player with great potential and move him to another position.  The NFL has several examples of former LB's playing Safety & so on.\nBugs\/Crashes: (B) It doesn't crash often with the patches.  A nice change from last year where it took 5 patches to improve system stability.\nThis time it was reasonablyh stable after 2 patches.  It did not like my NVidia graphics card until I updated the driver.  It would re-set the card's clock speed and ram speed to the lowest programmable level leaving the system partially unstable and the game unplayable.  This was NOT a bug in the driver, since this is the ONLY game to ever have this problem.  Updating to the latest drivers from NVIDIA.com solves this issue.\nGiving it a \"B\" here is clearly being a bit too charitable, since I am not factoring in having to update drivers, and apply several game fixes.  But if you do the same, you will probably also be pleased with the over all stablity.  If you don't take these steps, be prepared for crashes, lockups, dumps to windows, etc.\nOver all: (C) It does somethings quite well. It is pleasing visually. With a few obvious and glaring exceptions, it has most of the features we want, they just don't all work very well. Bottom line is this. I would rate it lower if there were anything to compare it to, but there isn't.  Sadly, This is isn't the best PC football game, it is the only one.\nImproved from last year:\n--Player ratings are a tiny bit more detailed.\n--graphics are improved.\n--Stability is improved (comparison after the 2 patches, 2001 with all 5 or 6 patches is equally stable).\n--Better sliders, most offer seperate tuning of computer and human players.\n--Online play is supposed to work this year.  I haven't bothered yet, based on how very badly it worked last year.\nWorse then last years model:\n--Playbook customization is gone.\n--play design is gone.\n--the hurry up clock is gone.  And since the game manages time so badly you have to play with 8 to 10 minute quarters to compensate.\n--sound.  Removing the taunting and 'smack' talk removed much of the color from the game play.\nOver all, it's slightly better then last years but not by much.  It's disappointing to see how many of the flaws carried forward.  Even most disappointing to see features being dropped.","summary":"Beautiful but flawed gem","unixReviewTime":1003881600,"vote":"22","style":null,"image":null}

That's right, this time there's no advantage in numbers, we need you to go in solo.  Command and Conquer Renegade places you into the first shooter in the C&C universe.  Playing the role of Nick \"Havoc\" Parker in your quest to stop Nod's most evil plot to date.\nGameplay:\nAs far as first-person shooters go, this sits on the arcade side of the market.  Everything from hit detection, weapon physics and  enemy AI lacks what could be considered realistic direction. Yet, as far as arcade shooters go, this one has its merits.  The enemy density is quite challenging at times, especially on the hardest settings, and their accuracy will give even a seasoned FPS gamer a run for their money.  The downside is that the enemy AI reacts with more of a bot mentality than an 'intelligent' one.  For those of you unfamiliar with bots, this means that regardless of the enemies using any cover or environmental awareness, they just come straight at you.  Often in straight lines if you take the time to string them out.  Their lack of intelligence is compensated by their inhuman accuracy.\nAny of lack of polish exhibited in the game is more than covered by it's definite C&C feel.  As a GDI commando, you have access to weapons and vehicles made popular in the original C&C world.  Whether you're driving a flame tank, or placing beacons for your ion cannon, it definitely feels like you're playing a small, albeit important, role to take down the Brotherhood of Nod.\nGraphics:\nThe game looks dated, even for only being from 2002, it is really blocky.  The character and vehicle models have extremely low polygon counts.  The FMV's between each level also use a modified version of the game engine and the eyes and mouths look completely off.  However, I'm never one to downplay a game because of it's graphics unless that is all it has going for it.  Just being able to walk around and inside a Hand of Nod, or being able to get inside a mammoth tank and crush the opposition is enough to satisfy anyone's visual needs.\nSound:\nRenegade uses a ton of sounds familiar to any C&C vets.  Even the music is highly reminiscent of the original.  All this adds to the feeling of being inside the C&C universe.  The only downside is that because the sounds are old, at times it feels like your weapons really lack some oomph.  You can unload 100 rounds from your assault rifle into an unwitting rocket soldier and the sound can make it feel like your shooting spitballs at an over-ripe watermelon.\nOverall:\nThis definitely has to be the best cross-genre attempt made by any gaming franchise.  I was highly worried about buying this after having gone through X-COM's attempt at FPS, but I was pleasantly surprised.  For the going price, this is definitely a must buy for any fan of the C&C series and barring a few bugs, the only downside to this game is the bot-style AI.  Just make sure to update it ASAP and if you're looking to stretch your gaming dollar even further, be sure to try it multiplayer where you take part in a Tribes \/ Savage mix.","summary":"One of the best attempts at a cross-genre approach","unixReviewTime":1089763200,"vote":"6","style":null,"image":null}

What I thought would take a few hours ended up taking an entire evening.  Defeating those wicked NOD guys was the most mind-numbing experience ever - I could still feel my brain pounding long after the final cutscene played.  Getting up for work the next day was almost as difficult!\nSo, of course when Westwood announced they were going to make a first-person shooter based on C&C, I had to get it.  I can tell you C&C Renegade is a worthy first attempt yet it does fall short compared to the current crop of shooters out now.\nPROS:\n1. Graphics - I'm surprised at other reviewer's complaints.  Not the best in terms of detail or graphic quality, but still very good for a game of this size and scope.\n2. Action - Very engaging.  It's not a one-man show - you're usually thrown into the heat of battle with explosions all around you.  Plus you get to drive a lot of the vehicles too.\n3. C&C Theme - all the goodies, GDI Cannons, Tiberium Harvesters, Obelisks, etc...  The sound effects are very reminiscent of the early games, it even keeps track of the number of NOD soldiers you squish in your mammoth tank.\n4. Cutscenes - very cool.  Just when I think Westwood is slacking towards the later levels they throw in a nice epic movie to watch between levels.\n5. Music - Awesome!! (as always)  C&C games still have the best soundtracks.\nNEUTRAL:\n1. Level Design - Yeah, it's Westwood's first foray into level design and it shows.  But quite frankly it shows just how accustomed gamers have gotten to having everything linear; we expect to follow a straight line to the goal and never have to backtrack once!  At least in this game you can pretend this would be more like a real world assault.  Besides, we're doing everything from beach assaults to desert sieges to sneak attacks in cities, submarines and snow covered mountain bases.  What's wrong with that?\n2. Voice Acting - Decent.  Our hero Major Havoc sounds more like Duke Nukem.  \"You're going up against a whole squadron by yourself?\"  \"Yeah, doesn't seem fair does it?  Maybe I'll shoot left-handed.\"  Am I the only one who gets a little creeped out by the way they move their lips?\n3. Weapons - All nicely balanced with the exception of the grenade launcher.  This worthless weapon makes huge explosions that seem to leave the enemy unfazed most of the time.  Is this thing on?\nCONS:\n1. Load Times - Ugh.  Over 2 min to load a level!  If you're killed or even if you restart the same level it takes just as long!  It's so annoying you'll end up playing the easier difficulty settings just to avoid dying.  Minus one star for this annoyance.\n2. Enemy AI - Atrocious! As much as I'd like to be biased I have to admit this is one of the worst ever.  I can round a corner, see someone crouched behind a box, pump about ten rounds into him and while I stop to reload, he goes back to crouching behind the box... uhhh hello?  I'll pick off someone with my sniper rifle and the guy next to him will just stand there and wait for his turn.  I smirk when I'm warned of \"elite\" enemy forces approaching as these high-caliber opponents basically run into my line of fire and take maybe a few more hits to kill.  Doom had better AI.  Minus one star for this (and that's being nice!)\n3. System Requirements - Considering a game like Wolfenstein runs on my system without a hitch, I'm disappointed I have to minimize all the detail settings using my (fairly new) Geforce 2 Pro and even then the frame rates choppy.  You're gonna need a 1.4 gig system and a GF3 at the very least to run this game smoothly.\nTo sum it up - C&C fans (with sufficient hardware) will find enough to overlook the rather major annoyances in the game.  Hardcore action fans, however, will find plenty to nitpick about but may realize that, in spite of it all, it's still a really fun game to play.\nHope my review helped!","summary":"C&C fans (like me) will like it - others may expect better","unixReviewTime":1017964800,"vote":"40","style":null,"image":null}

I was amazed at the graphics at the time and loved the audio. Omaha Beach was intense!\n\nI was on a Battlefield 2 binge and decided since I was in FPS mode I'd load up good ol' MoH. At first I thought it wouldn't even install since Vista is loaded on my computer. But it installed and played without a hitch which made me giddy!\n\nAs I started playing it on the hardest mode, I felt my old childish gaming feelings rising. I was DYING. These weren't live people on the other end of a toon shooting at me, these were computer run programs designed to shoot at me and I was DYING. As I continuously died, I started blurting out expletives. Then I'd pause the game and wonder where that particular word had come from. I'd continue playing and die again and another expletive would explode from my mouth.\n\nI soon realized that I have been playing online games for about 5-6 years now and am used to a human opponent killing me. I got used to it and realized that humans are pretty smart and that no matter how good I think I am, there's always somebody better. But coming back to a straight, storyline, FPS game and getting shot up by computer AI was unacceptable.\n\nDo you ever remember a specific movie from the past that you absolutely loved and still say you love today even though you haven't seen it since the mid-80s? And then you find the movie on video or DVD, buy it, watch it, and say to yourself...\"Hey, this is kind of goofy. Why did I like this so much?\" It's called the test of time. MoH was ground-breaking in its day and certainly was fun to play. But now, compared against even the classic Battlefield 1942, it is archaic in its simplicity both graphic and playability wise. That doesn't mean it isn't challenging and fun, but you can see the limitations it has compared to where technology is today.  Kind of like going back and playing Pac-Man.\n\nAnyhoo, after fighting my way from Africa, to the beaches of Normandy, to the Bocage, and beyond, I eventually beat MoH...again. After my final victory I quickly went into the bathroom and washed my mouth out with soap. I then dressed nice and walked over to my neighbors homes and apologized in person for the loud, obnoxious, and obscene houseguest that was staying with me during that time.","summary":"Medal of Honor: Allied Assault","unixReviewTime":1211241600,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

And while EA likes to boast the realism, frankly that only goes as far as the weapons, the launguages and the location.  The game is 100% linear and 99% predictable, and after finishing it, I feel more like I have finished reading a book, not playing a game.  Honestly, the mistakes are so glaring that EA really could have made a better game if they would have tried harder.  This is definatly one you will need to try for yourself, and reach your own conclusions on.\nThe GOOD:\n- Missions remain interesting throughout the game.\n- Some wonderfully scripted encounters, and occasionally you will get to see wonderful character actions in your allies as well as your enemies.\n- Nice range of American and German weapons, and fairly accurate noises.  Tanks are fairly life-like as are aircraft.\n- Lots of speaking (English and German).  Scripts are correct for the locations, and you don't run into situations where dead soldiers are carrying on conversations and such, as you do in some other titles.\n- Accurate uniforms (within reason).\n- Sniper rifles are accurate, powerful and fun (and there are plenty of opportunities to use them, if that is your thing).\nThe BAD:\n- The graphics are not as good as, for example, Return to Castle Wolfenstein on the Xbox (I'm using a Nvidia GeForce4 64mb DDR video card), or as nice as Delta Force Blackhawk down (which is a better game).\n- When shot, your character's aim flies across the screen.  This may enhance the realism, but when you are confronted with multiple enemies it makes it virtually impossible to hit anyone and soon becomes incredibly annoying.\n- Enemies have certain locations from which they spawn, in fact you can find them and stand there and gun them down as they suddenly materialize.  Also, some enemies (like snipers) have not materialized until you step past a certain point (into their line of fire) and then they spawn and fire.\n- Cannot interact with surroundings (doors, windows, etc.)\n- Lack of blood (to maintain the Teen rating).\n- Very linear.\nThe UGLY:\n- MG42\/44 is lethal in the hands of the enemy, but when you have the opportunity to man one the bullets fly everywhere but where you are aiming, in fact, the machine gun is only slightly more effective than any of your standard arms, and much more frustrating to try and use.\n- Allied AI is NIL, and considering some of these guys are supposed to be Rangers...they just run into the open and fire then stop, then fire and stop again while they are being gunned down.  I was happy to see them get slaughtered so at least I could move (oh yah, you are stuck behind any obstacle as if it were twice as wide as it really is).\n- Enemies continue to rush you with no regard to their own casualties, and will even run from around a corner straight into your fire, requiring no effort from you to gun down entire squads.\n- Shrubbery and leaves will block your bullets, but not the bullets of the enemies, making Snipers almost impossible to kill unless you rush their positions.\n- Snipers are way too good (even when I knew exactly where they were they could see me before I could see them).\n- The signifigant lack of an ending of any sort is unforgiveable.  What did they do, just give up halfway through???","summary":"One man's \"greatest game in the world\" is another's letdown","unixReviewTime":1056067200,"vote":"4","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

I have to admit, it is fun, but the story is dull, the violence is toned down, you have to play multiplayer on Gamespy Arcade, which swarms you with advertisements the instant you open it. I am highly dissapointed to see such a great game have so many downpoints, that I actually rated the game \"so, so\"\nThe other thing is that the system requirements are way, and I mean way, to high. The system requirements are 500mhz with 64 megs of ram. My 500mhz P3 computer with 256 megs of ram doesn't cut it. If you think that your old computer will do the job, think again.

You have machine guns, a rocket launcher, rifles, SMG's, pistols, and some far out grenades.\nTo sum it all up, this game is good, but with many downsides and the system requirements are too steep.

You're forced to fly through it to keep up with the opponent's advancements..\n\nBut as I was playing with 2 AI opponents, I was forced to pay exorbinant tributes very early in the game to keep one as an ally (if you ignore his requests, he comes to attack you soon and you end up with 2 against 1 which is impossible to sustain).. this goes on while the other opponent builds up very quickly (much quicker than I believe is even humanly possible & w\/out having to give away his vital resources) and started attacking me before I could build any proper defense.\nSo I was kept down by tribute fees to 1 while the other quickly built up a strong, wealthy empire and attacked me mercilously. NOT fun.  And this is on Moderate level right after 'easy'!?!\n\nThat led me to try playing with 1 AI opponent instead to see if that was any easier without having to hand over tributes that depleted me and it really wasn't as the attacks were relentless because they build up so fast and strong. I'd keep checking to see where the other kingdom was early on in the game and it literally seemed impossible to have stone walls & gates SO early on.\n\nModerate level in my opinion is actually HARD level, it's not scaled correctly for moderate players. Easy is too easy...

Breeding monsters is the name of the game here and you need to start planning early.  Basicly, you are trying to find something to plug up a hole in the island of GreatLog before it sinks. This involves travelling through five different worlds with a team of three monsters(they actually follow you and it's so cute). Other monsters are stored on your Dad's ranch. The quest itself doesn't take much time, but even after it's over there's still much to do to prove yourself as the greatest monster trainer in GreatLog.  Many monsters can't be caught and have to be bred from other monsters and it's really hard to catch duplicates, so make your plans early. Catching monsters is done by feeding them meat until they become friendly.  Unfortunately, money and meat aren't easy to come by and there's no way to tell when you've given them enough. They also don't tell you the gender of the monster until you've caught it.  You can change the gender of an egg before hatching it, which is useful.  Saving is only allowed in towns and buildings (not dungeons) and in GreatLog, which is a pain.  When you breed monsters you get the egg, but the original monsters leave forever, so you can't get too attached.  One cool thing is that you don't usually choose which moves your monsters use in battle (in the colessium you can't at all). You have to trust your monsters to make the right decisions on their own and the more training they have, the better they do.  You also have to take their personalities and wildness levels into account when planning your battle strategy.  Basicly, if you're looking for an in depth RPG, move on, but if you want a serious monster breeding and training simulator, look no further.  And get the Prima guide, it has all the monster and breeding info you really need for this game.","summary":"Still short of Pokemon, but provides many, many hours of fun","unixReviewTime":1025740800,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

You can't deke the goalie and you will never know what type of plays warrant goals.  It is very frustrating due to lack of consistency in goal-scoring.

I define a good game by the right mixtures: Originality, Game Quality, Easy To Get Use to and Control, Action Type, Objective Settings, and so on. I'll make this clear and precise as possible. Please take note this is my OPINION, you might think different.\nGood Things:\n-The game is nice if you're bored of the same old pokemon games and their battling techniques.\n-The games texture and graphics are a good improvement from other GBA games.\n-The game is long and challenging.\nBad Things:\n-The game can become extremely frustrating. Why? Many reasons.\n1. Whenever you enter the net, you come across viruses or enemies, to make it simple. They are challenging at first, but in the later stages when you become powerful, they are just plain annoying, especially when you're trying to accomplish long, tedious missions given to you by the game. You must have an escape chip to actually escape! You can only hold 30 chips in your \"moves\" folder. So if you have, for example, 2, your chances of getting them and escaping battles you don't want is 2\/30. You get 5 chips per turn that you skip and press ADD during your chip selection. Think about it.\n2. The cost of items in this game is way too high, in my opinion. As a player in a RPG game, you would like to improve your weapons so you can defeat your enemies faster\/easier right? Well, try to when it takes 10,000zens just to get one M Cannon, which does 120 damage. The common later viruses have like 200hp. The beginning bosses are about 600+. Therefore you need more than 1 powerful chip. How long would it take? Say forever?\n3. Oh yeah, chip combos are made by putting same letter chips together. Example, two different chips with the letter L next to it, say Cannon Chip L and Dash Chip L. You can select it both at once and use it without the need to wait for the bar to fill up to select more chips. Its really hard to make the combos and play fast when you gotta check out the letters next to each chip to see if you can play it together. The letter range is long!\n4. The missions are nice, IF YOU KNOW HOW TO GET IT! They seem to expect you to know exactly where to go. Well they don't Mr. Creator! Therefore, what you either do is get FAQS or wonder around, mindlessly and extremely frustrated, until you find where you need to go. Got Milk?\n5. The only real fun is raising Megaman, upgrading him which is hell, and fighting the bosses and people with powerful P.E.Ts. Megaman is a PET. This is where it *beeped* up. Its usually rare or it takes a horribly ammount of time and work to finally encounter those few people. The rest of the game is filled with viruses that aren't challenging and you can't simply escape easily.\nHere's a clue for everyone. Why buy when you can get it for free? HAHAHA.","summary":"A More Realistic Review","unixReviewTime":1081814400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Imagine super monkey ball with crash inside the ball :)). It is kind of short, but what is there is extremely fun (although sometimes irritating). The reason I gave this game a 3 star rating is because of two things. The first is the load times. It takes (on average) 45 seconds-1 min to load each level. This wouldn't be bad, but that brings me to the second problem. There is no loading bar, so you can't see how much longer it's gonna be. Plus, while you are waiting for it to load, this annoying alarm type noise plays. Now, put all that together and imagine sitting there for a minute not knowing how much longer they are gonna torture you with that annoying noise.

If you were expecting improved graphics, then your expectations will be pleasantly fulfilled. The game moves very smoothly through some beautiful environments.\nSo what are my complaints? First, Crash seems harder to control than I remember from his previous adventures. I think one of the biggest factors in this are the camera angles. Sometimes it seems that the camera is too close so that you cannot see everything around you, and then sometimes it seems too far away and it is hard to judge the depth of your enemies. I think I noticed this the most on the levels where you have a front view of Crash and he is being chased by something behind him. The camera seems to be in way too close, so that nitro crates, holes, and other obstacles just jump out in front of you, forcing you to die a million times while you memorize the route you have to take. Second, some of levels tended to be repetitive. Granted, I did enjoy some of the newer levels. There were a couple of short sections of levels where you got to ride a mine cart, which was fun. There were also three levels where you were rolling through the level inside a sphere, giving it a marble madness feel. I would have liked to see more levels like these rather than the underwater and biplane levels that seem to pop up repeatedly in every single game in the series. Third, the bosses were just painful. I may be biased because I really do not like bosses, but these ones seemed more annoying than usual. Lastly, the loading times were the worst I have ever seen in any video game. You have spend at least a minute or so staring at a loading screen every time you enter and leave a level. I was actually discouraged from playing this game many times because I knew how much time would be wasted on loading screens.\nOf course a Crash Bandicoot game would not be complete without the gems and relics. After you beat a level, you can replay it and try to open every box in the level to win a gem, or race through the level and beat a set time to win a relic. Once you beat the final boss you are granted access to a secret room with 5 extra levels that are earned by winning relics from the levels. This could be interesting if you actually have the patience to play through all the levels over again.\nI might have given this game 4 stars had it not been for the hideous loading times. It got so ridiculous that I would start flipping channels during the loading screens because I got so bored. Aside from that, this is a pretty adequate helping of Crash if you have enjoyed previous games.","summary":"Decent Game, but Flawed","unixReviewTime":1029801600,"vote":"27","style":{"Platform:":" PlayStation2"},"image":null}

I don't know if this is because Konami helped out with this or what but the game certainly lacks in what the first three on the PS1 surely had, and that my friends is gameplay.\nCrash returns in this game to once again battle Cortex.  The formula for Crash isn't changed much at all but this game suffers from what the first one suffered from.  That my friends is Tedious load times.  It takes a minute just to enter a level for crying out loud!  The load times of this game definitely make this game suffer.\nThe in-game levels are fun, but are immenesly populated. Not just with enemies but with obstacles too.  Some levels are also extrememly lengthy and it seems like your going to ask the question \"Are we there yet?\" several times.\nAwkward camara angles in conjunction to enemy placements and platform placements was a pain.  The camara would be at an awkward angle and you'd think the platform was in front of you, but you end up having to move to the right or left a bit.  By the time you figure it out you'll probably have died several deaths that could've been avoided.\nAs usual the controls are very easy to learn and shouldn't be a problem to get the hang of.  But sometimes the response of the controls can cause you to lose sometimes.\nOverall this wasn't a bad game but it certainly wasn't a good game either.  The series lost its edge of solid gameplay and went down to the frustrating level.","summary":"Game lacks in what the first three on the PS1 had","unixReviewTime":1007424000,"vote":"5","style":{"Platform:":" PlayStation2"},"image":null}

I had really high hopes for this game as we play through Crash 3 (Warped) every few months.\nThis game is much more difficult than Crash 3.  We have gotten through about 20\/25 levels. Some of the boss stages  have been (unnecessarily) frustrating.  I would say that my 7 yr old can do about 75% of the levels and my 4 yr old has only been able to do 3 or 4.\nThere is only real new play mode we've seen so far - on several levels Crash is in a glass ball and you run in the ball through the level.  I think these are pretty good, we have replayed some of these just for fun.\nOn a couple of levels Crash flies an airplane as in previous games.  These levels aren't nearly as difficult as the past games and are now kind of frustratingly easy.\nThere has been 1 racing level that I didn't enjoy too much.  There are holes in the road that you can't see until too late, and the other cars seem to make it their mission to get in your way.  It took me about 12 tries to complete it, and when I did it seemed like it was random instead of that my skill had increased.\nOn a couple of levels you play as Coco, and in parts of these levels Coco rides a scooter or a snowboard.  It is kind of irritating that Coco doesn't inherit the skills you acquire like tip-toeing or double-jump.  We really like the levels in the old game where you rode the baby tiger and were kind of disappointed that there weren't any of those in this one.  The Cocoa levels are pretty good, though.\nThere are a few underwater levels in which you swim or drive a submarine through.  There are some mine-looking things that fall down from above as you approach them.  The only trouble is that they are sometimes off the top of the screen.  You either have to take baby steps through the level or memorize where they are.  I don't think these levels are very fun (but then again I didn't like either the swimming or jet ski levels from Crash 3 either).\nThe load times are extremely annoying.  My 7 year old and I have 2 ways to entertain ourselves during the load times.  Sometimes we imitate Crash falling through the air.  Sometimes we joke about how many things we could do while a level is loading.  (I say \"Wanna go eat dinner while this loads? He says:  \"Are you sure it will be done by then?\")  I usually turn the game on and walk away and do something.  Then I load a level and walk away again.\nI don't think this game is as polished as Crash 3 was.  Some things are irritatingly hard and others seem too easy - it seems like they rushed it out for Christmas 2001.  One of the little things that drive me nuts is that you can fall off the edge of cliffs when you are trying to go onto the platform for bonus levels.  It seems like the key to success is often to die and die until you memorize the level enough to get through it (jump here, don't jump here.  That box is not worth trying for, etc...).  The first game of the series was kind of like that, but I thought the 2nd and 3rd were less so.\nWhen you collect the 3rd mask it is hard to tell that you are invincible.  The previous games had a really distinctive drum beat that played - in this game the music changes but it is really subtle and you have to be paying attention to even know.\nI also think the music is not nearly as good as in the previous games.  The songs from the previous Crash games were pretty hummable but I can't say I even really notice the music in this one.\nOne more thing I wanted to mention is that I get some motion sickness sometimes when playing 3d games.  I know that many people suffer from this.  One if the things I appreciated about the previous games is that I could play it without getting dizzy.  This game does contain a few levels in it that make me a bit dizzy, but it isn't too bad.\nSo what you want to know is, should you buy it.  I think I've been really hard on this game because my expectations were so high due to home much we enjoy Crash 3, which is my favorite platform game ever.  Some people have complained that it is too easy, but it matches my attention span for a game pretty well.

Aboard the spacecraft is a young enigma possessing the horrid awareness of a great forthcoming catastrophe.  Sent as an emissary, Meredy must prevent her home planet, Celestia, from fatally colliding with the planet Inferia.  Witnessing the monstrous projectile disembark close to their village, two dear friends, Reid and Furrah, futilely attempt to communicate with the visitor. Unable to comprehend the intensions of Meredy, nearby villagers banish the stranger.  Concerned and up to the brim of gallantry, Reid and Furrah agree to voyage with the gate-crasher and what they least expect is a crusade to (as with all RPG's) eventually defend their world.  Namco's third installment to the Tales of Destiny series is definitely a stalwart one, yet not as enticing as the closely nonexistent PlayStation can truthfully offer (i.e., Metal Gear, Final Fantasy VII).  What seems as a slack-jawing quest only passes up as a sluggish and dreadfully predictable one.\nReintroducing the RPG's most inventive feature, Real-time clashing, Namco's latest can only go so far with one great area, the fighting engine, where the other departments hurtle in a downward spiral.  Tweaking and ameliorating flaws found in the prequel, Namco has decided to discard the round 1 fighting found in the prequel, allowing the player to manage one character in real time fashion as the computer takes control of the other three.  The battle encounters are generally fast-paced, even though at times the computer on your side typically performs useless moves like casting an ineffectual spell or two.  The enjoyable customizable setups and minigames are unsuccessful to deeply facilitate the game's shabbiness.  Mildly enhanced, the RPG is a hollow shell when compared to current RPG standards.  Thrown in are the repetitive mundane phase; random battles, level gaining, overly exaggerated bosses, traveling from town to town, and recruiting seasoned allies along the way.  Although knocking the crap outta the enemies in fighter-like style is fantastic, the game's lagging story is a hideous monstrosity.\n\nRevolving in old-school 2D and characters textured in brightly rendered sprites, Tales of Destiny 2 appears as if it were one of the more earlier PlayStation games.  The overview world is done in a scruffy, reduced landscape and lacks the punch to impress anyone who owns any next-gen system.  Heroes in the battle engine are garishly tinted with a fine coat of colors.  Monsters, usually in a goop of bizarre, cutesy outfits, get quite annoying with their harmless forms.  On the contrast to the fluid colors, it really goes along with the simplicity of the game.  The musical score is nothing to brag about, delivering dull, monotonous sounds.  Plagued with many inescapable flaws, the game couldn't possibly lower its status but does with terrible voice acting.  The spoken dialogue seems to be a bunch of scrambled, unrehearsed lines.\nAll-in-all Tales of Destiny 2 stirs up as habitual as your daily brew.  Failing to furnish the life span of the PlayStation, I wouldn't recommend to shell out money for this unpleasing RPG.  With Final Fantasy X looming closer and presently released in Japan, Namco should have been more on the highbrow and pulled this one off as a revolutionary title on the PlayStation 2.  Mediocre games like these further indicate how the PlayStation should take its concluding vacation.","summary":"Not Much to Offer Here","unixReviewTime":1002931200,"vote":"6","style":null,"image":null}

However, I think that much of the unhappiness stems from the fact that so many Tetris fans hold the game in such high regard that even tampering with it for the better seems to offend them. I am not a hardcore Tetris fan, and indeed up until a few years ago I did not enjoy the game at all. I think I can offer a bit of middle ground perspective on Tetris Worlds, and hopefully this will prove useful to people.\nFirst, the good. I really enjoy three of the new game modes, namely Cascade, Fusion, and Hot-Line Tetris. They all feature gravity (pieces fall into gaps below when you clear lines), and offer many opportunities for strategic planning. The original Tetris is also rather enjoyable, although I don't care much for Sticky Tetris or the pretty much useless Square Tetris. I do, however, find the new features (which apply to all the game modes) to be rather useful: the ghost piece that shows you where your piece will land, the ability to see the next three pieces, and the ability to hold a piece and recall it later. Not everybody will care for these features, but I think they add a lot of opportunities to plan ahead and make for longer games.\nNow, the bad: the \"3D\" backgrounds are pretty lame. I'd just as soon have the cartoony backdrops of Tetris Attack. I don't find them as distracting as a lot of other reviewers here have, though. Perhaps that's because early reviews of the game were on the original GBA, and the clearer screen on the GBA SP makes the backgrounds less annoying.\nAlso, there's the mattery of the battery save. There isn't one! This game came out in 2001, and I think everyone will agree that no Game Boy game should have ever seen the light of day in 2001 (or after) without a battery save feature. This has two unfortunate consequences for Tetris Worlds: there's no high score table, and no way to save your preferences. The latter is particularly unfortunate if you decide you hate some of the new features and wish to turn them off - you'll have to do so every time you fire up the game.\nUltimately, what it comes down to is this: if you like Tetris, and want some variety, Tetris Worlds will most likely satisfy you. Is it the greatest Tetris game ever? No, but it is a good one. I originally bought it just for the Cascade Tetris mode, but I've found the other variations growing on me as well. I've sunk far too many hours into this game that could have otherwise been spent being productive, and in that regard, this is indeed a good Tetris game.","summary":"Not the best Tetris game ever, but still a good one","unixReviewTime":1074470400,"vote":"11","style":{"Edition:":" Standard","Platform:":" Game Boy Advance"},"image":null}

The sound effect when your piece hits the other blocks is not there.  Also, the blocks themselves should be more detailed. The detailed backgrounds are cool, but sometimes very distracting.  They should of included the option to play the original tetris as standard, instead you must put in a code to get it to appear.  When you play the \"popular\" version, the background is always ugly grey, and the game makes no noise at all when you score a Tetris.  Worst of all, it does not save scores.  I got a score over 1,500,000 and I cannot save it.

When I heard there was going to be a GBA version, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. And while it's fun to play, it's far from perfect.\nFirst, the good stuff. The graphics are nice, and stay true to the original (as do the sound effects). Arcade mode is a blast to play, and the various little bonus games you can unlock are pretty cool.\nBut there are, unfortunately, some significant problems with the game. Firstly, there's the fact that the GBA has two less buttons than the SNES. The control scheme is customizable, thankfully, but it takes time to get used to it. Finger-cramping is pretty common after playing for a long period of time, even if you're used to playing the GBA for extended sessions.\nAnother downside is the music. To put it simply, it's bad. We're talking barely Game Boy Color quality here, and it's a real shame. Part of the charm of the SF2 games is the cool music, and unfortunately this aspect did not carry over well to the GBA at all.\nAnd one other gripe - the game can crash. After unlocking Akuma, he can be your opponent in the arcade mode. But unfortunately, the game crashes and burns horribly 9 times out of 10 when it brings me to him in the arcade ladder. A console game crashing under normal usage is a Very Bad Thing(tm), and that's ultimately what brings this game's rating down from 4 stars to 3 stars in my book.\nConclusion: SF2 for GBA is fun, but in many regards it just doesn't do justice to the SNES versions. When you see awesome conversions like Mario Kart Super Circuit, and compare them to this somewhat lacking port of Street Fighter II, its faults can become pretty glaring.","summary":"It could be better, but it's still a blast to play","unixReviewTime":1010880000,"vote":"9","style":null,"image":null}

And neither did Keiji Inafune!  As legend has it, Inafune wanted to end the X series with MMX5 (BAD IDEA!) so that he could fully concentrate on the Mega Man Zero series, but the makers of X5, obviously not wanting to be out of a job, made X6 under his nose in only a few months and released it, forcing Inafune to change the Zero storyline to fit the new plot elements introduced in this new title (namely, Zero coming back to life).  So, one would ask, is X6 any good?  Surprisingly, yes it is...to a degree.  The problems that exist in this game are numerous as a result of the quick creation time, but for a game that only took a few months to make this is surprisingly well-crafted.  All the limitations present in X5 are in X6 (the crouching, the inability to shoot through walls, etc), but they're easier to take in this time around and aren't as much of a culture shock.  The environments have a strong visual appeal, the armors are fun to work with, Zero's fighting tactics have improved upon his rebirth, and even the level designs, though flawed and incomplete, can challenge the most ardent Mega Man\/X players, forcing them to strategize in order to complete them in as few deaths as possible.  Then again, all these good elements are offset by a storyline that basically apes the story in X4, Engrish-style dialogue complete with grammatical errors, the bosses having a roller-coaster-esque learning curve, both the pitiful (Commander Yammark) and the insidious (Infinity Mijinion), and the end result is a game with a lot of loose ends that still needed tightening, but as it stands it is, nevertheless, a decent title and better in scope than the anemic X5.","summary":"An incomplete mess, but still fun!","unixReviewTime":1330992000,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

I've been playing them since I was a kid. The X series is my favorite but it started to decline with Megaman X5. This game is a little better than X5 because you aren't forced to listen to Alia's messages that frequently halted the flow of Megaman X5's gameplay, and I really like the Shadow armor which finally lets Megaman conquer his greatest foe of all: SPIKES!\n-CONS: Unfortunately there still are no anime cutscenes like the ones in the outstanding Megaman X4, and the storyline is weak. There's so much more that could be done with this series, but they're just not putting the effort into it anymore. I don't think Capcom really knows where they're going with the story. What we need is a serious game with a decent budget and some freash ideas. All the bosses don't have to be animals (or plants) and Sigma doesn't have to always be the final boss. I'm sick to death of Sigma! They need to finally reveal EVERYTHING about the origins of X and Zero and whatever ties they may have to the original Megaman series and perhaps the Legends\/Dash series, then they should conclude the story. Unfortunately Megaman X7 jumps even further off track with the storyline but I'll stick with the series till they get it right again.\nMegaman X6 is an O.K. game but if you're just getting into Megaman I'd reccomend the Megaman Collection coming out in May and Megaman X4 first.

So I picked this up and poped it in. The first thing I noticed was that there were a lot of little movies. Players getting pumped up before a game, celebrations on and off the ice. I thought that was pretty cool, and a new added feature. But other than little things like that, this game doesn't offer much of anything new. Here's what I thought about this game, and why I only thought it a renter, not a buyer.\n1. The graphics: The players are sharper, the ice is thicker. The fans actually move in 3D! But overall, not to great. The puck is way too big, and the overall graphics just aren't to improved. This game had great graphics, but so did previous versions.\n2. The options: HORRIBLE. No create a team, no new features. And the biggest thing, no FRANCHISE mode! That was about as dumb as having no franchise mode in NBA Live 2001. I am seriously disapointed by the options in this game. Nothing new whatsoever!\n3. The overall depth: After your first season, this game will probably get pretty boring. More new features and better graphics is what this game needs. I hope EA changed things in 2003 edition. Oops, too bad! They did the same thing. Until they finally add some sort of franchise and stuff like that, EA's NHL series will continue, for me, to be a renter, not a buyer. Rent before u buy, then make your decision.

It's not that I regret it, necessarily, it's just that I had never played it, and I had only read mixed reviews.  So I think, what intrigued me, was the  controversy over the \"gore-zones\" this game featured, and how violent it was supposed to be.  I guess I wanted to see if the game lived up to the controversy.\n  It does.  Soldier of Fortune is a typical First Person Shooter, about a 'one man army' who fights his way through level after level of enemies that look exactly the same.  Aside from the extremely graphic violence, you wouldn't be able to tell this game apart from any other mediocre corridor shooter.  But the violence is very, very graphic.  Heads are split apart, limbs are torn off, intestines and chunks of various other organs protrude from gaping wounds.  It is all an attempt to portray violence 'realistically' in a videogame, but after a short period of time it all seems too over-the-top and very unnecessary.  Regardless of whether or not the developers were trying to make the game realistic, blood and gore should probably be a bit more limited than this.\n  So aside from this 'gimmick' the rest of the game is very average.  The control takes some getting used to, the framerate gets very choppy even with the very bland visuals, and the multiplayer mode seems pretty tacked on.\n  It isn't a horrible game.

The plotline attempts at Metal Gear Solid, but the story is far too predictable.  The controls are slightly awkward and sporadic.  Batman moves similarly to Lara Croft in Tomb Raider: Chronicles, and you have to constantly adjust the camera with the R1 button.  But Batman is more hyper than Lara and runs exceptionally fast.  You have to control his movements with finesse. The music in the game is also well-selected, and gets you into the whole Batman episode that you are attempting to defeat.  The action of beating up thugs and bosses is actually fairly decent, but the whole jumping puzzles are plain annoying.  And, please be prepared to do a lot of jumping puzzles in this game.  Another major flaw is the control of the vehicles, the Batplane and Batmobile.  The Batplane is like flying a simulator (e.g., Ace Combat, Star Wars: Rebel Assault, etc.).  However, the Batmobile is just plain clumsy.  The Batmobile can only drive within specific streets, and you don't have the ability to explore Gotham. The sound effects are also done pretty well, with the thugs sounding like the show.  Furthermore, the save feature could be worked upon.  There is really no in-game saving (like Metal Gear Solid).  Lastly, you really don't have the freedom to explore the city as I expected.  In this way, the freedom of the game resembles Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider or any of the other action\/adventure titles out there.\nAlthough this game isn't great, it's worth [money].

Plus, running around QUAKE-style, shooting bat-a-rangs is a little boring.\nSome of the in-game directions could use work, too. Some objectives aren't particularly clear at first...they should have tested the gameplay on people who didn't work on it.\nMy hope is that response will be strong enough for a streamlined sequel, with better overall controls, deeper fighting combinations, and the ability to bat-grapple wherever you'd like. The game isn't particularly hard, and it felt kinda lame beating up Mr. Freeze's thungs, who are all young women! (...who manage to be tougher than Joker's big thugs).\nEssentially, this game isn't nearly as puzzle oriented as TOMB RAIDER, but it makes up for it somewhat in overall style. If you see it used for $30-35, definitely pick it up. (Each star is worth $10.)","summary":"Fun for the comics enthusiast; some control quirks","unixReviewTime":1007856000,"vote":"13","style":null,"image":null}

We will take a look at how Square's interpretation of Real-Time combat fares and what contributions it made to the gaming world.\n\nSTORY: 4\/5\nUnlike the novel-ish FINAL FANTASY 6 and CHRONO TRIGGER, Secret of Mana (SoM) has a rather basic story with only a few exceptional moments. For this game I felt it worked rather well. Since the focus is on Real-Time combat, it only makes sense that the gamer spends most of their time fighting, not reading text.\nThere is only one ending and it's not 30 minutes long, but it does wrap up the story very well and makes the player feel rewarded.\n\nMUSIC: 5\/5\nHiroki Kikuta did the soundtrack for this game, SEIKEN DENSETSU 3 (SoM2) and the much lesser known SOUKAIGI. All are great soundtracks and worth hunting down. The music in this game is a nice change of pace from the epic works of Nobuo Uematsu. In general I found the music to be more playful and optimistic in the villages and \"calm spots\" of the world. Many of the palaces and dungeons feature music that is more mysterious than it is forboding.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 3.5\/5\nThis is where I really disagree with some of the reviews of this game I've read so far.\n\nOn the one hand, it is very obvious that the gameplay in this game was the precursor for the combat system in FINAL FANTASY 12, where you have 3 characters fighting simultaneously, two of them automatically. So in that regard the gameplay in SoM was very influential.\n\nThe actual actions of using magic and swinging your sword\/weapon around are not complicated--they're just as intuitive as they were in ZELDA. However, I found a few areas that could have used some attention:\n\n1) Tedious magic-leveling system. To go from level 1 to level 2, for example, you might have to cast a spell about 10 times. To gain more levels, you have to cast that spell more often. What I found really annoying were these two side-facts.\n  A) There is no point in leveling most of your magic. Especially the girl's magic, with the exception of Undine. You could leave most of your other magic creatures at Level 0 or Level 1 and still beat the game. Even the boy's magic is not necessary to raise all the way to level 8.\n  B) If you do want to raise the girl's magic, the best way to do it is to cast it on yourself--HUNDREDS of times! Sounds fun, doesn't it? If you want to raise the boy's magic, again, you have to cast it on enemies, HUNDREDS of times.\n\nIn my opinion, ALLOCATION POINTS would have worked better, where you get to pick which magic you need at \"full strength\" and change your alignment as needed.\n\nFinally, many of the spells are just plain worthless--granted, the Final Fantasy series is guilty of this as well, but it is annoying when you're building levels for a magic creature who only has one spell that you may only need for one or two boss fights.\n\n2) Pointless \"Weapon Charging\" system.\nWhen you build levels with your sword, you can \"charge\" it to do a \"better\" attack. In my experience, it simply multiplies your damage. So if you charge your sword to level 4 and cut loose, you might do 400 damage instead of 100.\nThe problem is this: While \"charging\" your sword, if you get damaged or take any status ailment, you have to start the \"charging process\" all over! At that rate, you'd be better off hitting enemies with several 100% Level 0 attacks.\n\n3) Corners and Snags. Your party consists of 3 characters, but you can only play one of them at a time. What results if you want to avoid enemies and just run through the dungeon? You quickly find that your movement is restricted due to the actions of your other characters. They'll constantly get snagged on corners, stuck down\/up-stairs, find themselves fighting enemies or getting struck with a status ailment--limiting\/stopping your movement until they recover. Instructing your non-playing characters to GUARD and KEEP AWAY has little effect, either. They still sometimes take a swipe as they pass an enemy.\n\nEven with all this, the game is still playable, but can be unnecessarily frustrating. Once you get to higher levels you become so powerful that (like in FF12), you pretty much just walk right through enemies and nuke everything in sight.\n\nGRAPHICS: 4.5\/5\nNot the best that I've seen on the SNES, but pretty high up there. The villages look very rustic and well-lived-in, featuring nice touches like flower pots outside, vines creeping up the roofs and plants growing between the roof tiles.\nThe bosses look pretty impressive and there is a nice variety that come in different sizes and alignments.\nI felt this game did an exceptional job with presenting colorful, varied environments. My favorite being the shadowy mushroom forest of King Truffle.\nThe overworld Mode 7 map is very impressive and alot of different effects are used, such as spinning it around when you exit a cannon-ball.\nOn the downside, I found that the magic spells were very basic-looking. I felt that the spells should have looked better graphically with each new level, as this would have given more incentive to improving your magic.\n\nCAMEOS: Santa and Rudolph make a brief appearance in this game. Cool points if you get the Kilroy reference when fighting the robot boss.\n\nMULTI-PLAYER: This game is known for the fact that if you have an adapter and 3 SNES controllers, each player can control one character. I've never seen anybody play the game this way. I can see how it could be frustrating if one person continually uses magic, meaning the other characters have to wait until the spell has subsided before they can move again.\n\nSUGGESTIONS: I think the lesser-known TERRANIGMA is an equally good game with many similarities but fewer annoyances.\n\nOVERALL: 4\/5\nI think it's fairly obvious that this was Square's first effort at Real-Time combat in an RPG. The graphics, story and music make up for the moments where the gameplay is a bit lacking or nonsensical.\n\nNo Rabite's were harmed in the writing of this review.","summary":"SQUARE GOES REAL-TIME","unixReviewTime":992304000,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

I clearly recall video game magazines and people discussing it quite often in the mid 90's.  Anyway now that I've finally experienced the game for myself, I think it's just an alright RPG.  It has some really amazing aspects such as the quirky and humorous storyline elements that occurs during conversations with the characters- this stuff personally reminds me of Simpsons-style humor more often than anything else which is a HUGE plus in my book.  It's almost like the game is making a mockery of the way characters communicate with each other in RPG's, but it's often subtle and easy to overlook if you're not paying close enough attention.\n\nI also think that when the humor is set aside so the seriousness of the storytelling gets going, there's a TON of emotional and sincere moments that are honestly capable of being placed in the same category as any of the stellar moments from the Final Fantasy series.  Earthbound actually reaches *that* level of excellent storytelling.  It simply does a wonderful job making all the main characters important which is what a well-told RPG story is supposed to do.  I'd probably prefer a different angle besides the same tired old \"young heroic boy must gather friends and save world from destruction\" plot that's been done WAY too many times, but I understand this was a popular theme in the mid 90's for turned-based RPG's so I'll give it a free pass.\n\nSpeaking of turn-based RPG's, it's no secret I've never really liked them.  I don't like the idea of being defenseless in battle while leveling up enough points\/experience just to progress the story\/gameplay, however Earthbound takes the all too familiar turn-based style and makes it so simplistic that I can't really find any faults with it.  I unfortunately sort of think enemies on screen are very bland and lifeless when the actual battles begin.  They basically show no movement or animation whatever and instead rely on making noises or blink\/flicker occasionally to indicate they've taken damage, but that's all they really do.  It's really boring.  At least the menus and delivering spells and attacks while keeping an eye on your HP is done in a very easy to understand and faultless way.  No confusion whatsoever there which I like.\n\nNow to give the game a tremendous compliment, the music is absolutely *brilliant*.  I seriously like this music more than just about everything Chrono Trigger provides (except for the victory theme, hehe) and probably more than 80% of the music I've heard from the Final Fantasy series.  The music is constantly terrific no matter where you explore in Earthbound.  Whether it's the Asian temple areas, the mysterious dark caves or roaming through the towns\/neighborhoods, the music constantly feels more meaningful and beautiful in Earthbound than it does in most RPG's.  The person\/people responsible for writing this music deserves a bunch of credit.  The music seriously feels greater than video game music, almost like it's written from a classical performers perspective.  I especially like some of the trippier\/more ambient stuff in the caves or during the enemy battles, which feels futuristic at times with its innovative techno style but constantly keeps my attention span in check.  The futuristic music in particular captures the ambience brilliantly.  The desert areas more playful\/Band-like music can't be denied either.  The Band is an early 70's rock band if you don't know.  Or how about the particular creative battle theme that sounds similar to the bass work of a 50's or 60's jazz artist.  I can't say enough about the music overall.  Also how great IS it that each time you enter the battle (enemy) screen, you're awarded with a different theme?  Unlike Super Mario RPG with the same old tedious battle music that wears thin after a while.\n\nSpeaking of music, how about the rock band characters you meet along the way?  They make up a crucial element to the story by frequently appearing in many spots of the game to assist your journey (and by the way your characters consist of Ness, Paula, Jeff and a guy named Poo).  I never would've guessed early on just how significant they'd become.  Also the police part near the beginning where you have to fight a bunch of them in a backroom... lol!  This game loves being humorous, but doesn't overdo it.  The carefree playfulness and exploration of the many buildings and homes is probably an even bigger element to the game.  How about that glowing fluorescent city area?  How cool is that place!  If you're not fighting dangerous monsters that possess deadly powers, you're fighting more innocent and playful things like a car and a parking meter, lol.  While this may sound really silly, it works in a way that's admirable and spices up what would've been just another typical RPG without these elements.\n\nI like how the main characters dad is important in the sense that you can withdraw\/deposit money from him or from ATM machines which is a nicely implemented and different idea for using a games money system, but perhaps \"dear old dad\" overstays his welcome by constantly popping up throughout the game and questioning if you'd like to take a break.  Hey I remember when my parents would come into the living room and ask me the same question when I used to play video games for hours on end.  Clearly a message on the game creators part about encouraging kids to do more than sit around playing video games all the time.\n\nI HATE that cameraman who keeps dropping down from the sky to take your picture.  I don't get the purpose of this annoying character at all.  I must've missed something because I thought there was a reason for all this picture taking.  I fully expected a picture book to appear before the credits rolled at the end of the game showing all the pictures the cameraman was taking of the characters and their journey similar to the ending of Donkey Kong Country 3.  It doesn't happen that way.  Again though, I think I missed something obvious somewhere or perhaps didn't explore the game\/towns enough to activate this feature.  Besides the weak generic-looking and bare backgrounds more reminiscent of an NES game and the diverse amount of areas you eventually explore which often feel somewhat tiny and incomplete, Earthbound is still pretty good and recommended for the story and humor which is emotional, uplifting, often creative and just consistently top-notch.  Even a guy like me who doesn't normally have the patience to play turn-based RPG's doesn't mind pulling out this game once in a while and playing it.","summary":"earth knows no bounds","unixReviewTime":1422144000,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Now that I'm experiencing the game in today's world as an adult where technology has advanced and the RPG genre has been perfected and perhaps exhausted, what's it like approaching a game like Secret of Mana now?\n\nWell to put it honestly, it's a pretty darn cool game!  Secret of Mana has been recommended to me literally 20 times by now by 20 different people over the last 15 years, so I finally had to see what all the fuss is about.  I mean if people are talking about the game NOW 20 years after release is has to be good right?  This game does so many things wonderfully that's it's almost indescribable how much fun it is.  The fast-paced action of not only running around but battling enemies in real time action instead of the typical and tiresome turn-based way, and being able to switch between 3 characters was an extraordinary technological step at the time compared to most RPG's where you could only play as one character.\n\nThe music is another high point.  Probably not the very best music I've ever heard in an RPG, but pretty high up on the list of memorable video game music nonetheless.  It can be majestic in the castle areas, peaceful and ambient in the towns some of the time while more upbeat and happy in others, hoedown-ish in the caves, adrenaline-rushing during the boss fights, haunting carnival music appearing in a few areas, etc.  The ambient stuff happens to be my favorite aspects which is really surprising considering ambience is usually low on my list of favorite genres.  The emphasis on melody and emotion is really evident when listening to the themes in this game regardless what type of music it is.  I actually think the majestic castle theme is my favorite theme in the game.  It's sweeping, melodic and just awesome!  Hard to believe but this isn't the first time a majestic piece of music is my favorite song in a video game.  Super Castlevania IV is another example.  Two drastically different types of games of course (Secret of Mana and Super Castlevania IV).\n\nThe boss battles... do you like fighting a ton of bosses?  I sincerely hope the answer is yes because I've NEVER seen so many boss fights in an RPG before, much less an old school RPG on the Super NES console.  An amazing amount of variety.  They appear unpredictably often times too which is another exciting element of the game.  Sometimes you're simply walking to the next area just minding your business nonchalantly exploring the lands and BOOM!  Boss fight time!  I like how you can switch between 3 playable characters which really enhances the excitement and tension found in the boss fights.  The magic spells are frequently used here, and it's necessary to use them particularly during boss fights because many bosses pack a mean punch.\n\nNow this game isn't flawless by any means.  It's unfortunate Secret of Mana does in fact contain a few flaws.  The biggest one is the dialogue.  While it's competent and certainly readable, it's pretty generic and forgettable often times.  Perhaps the emotional rollercoaster and perfection that is Terranigma has spoiled me into raising my expectations a few notches higher in relation to the RPG genre as a whole, who knows.  The lack of emotion by all the characters is pretty hard not to notice I'm afraid.  When I play an RPG I like to feel what the characters are feeling, but unfortunately for the most part this doesn't occur in Secret of Mana.  There's a big exception involving the main characters mother that I won't spoil however, and a few minor examples.  The townspeople however are all completely forgettable.  By the way I like the element of taking a nap and having your party's health restored.  Here I thought the Legend of Zelda series came up with this idea.\n\nAlso the castles are average at best, and often times they're too short to make much of an impact.  The castles are also generic but it's surprising to me personally how short and straightforward they usually are.  You'll probably never get lost for a significant period of time.  The overworld is the same way I'm afraid.  Straight paths.  On another note I like when your character picks up a treasure chest and actually shakes the item out of there!  It's more unique than just opening the chest and obtaining the item like in Zelda.  I wish the dungeons were similar to Zelda in size, detail and impact.  The story is just okay.  Everything centers on the Mana.  Mana seeds need to be collected and the Mana Sword needs to be obtained.  Otherwise an evil empire will bring the always threatening underworld to life.  Expect lots of surprises pertaining to characters seeming relatively harmless only to drop a HUGE surprise that they're not what they once were when you see them again.  I won't spoil anymore though!\n\nAt least the enemy variety (consisting of zombies, owls, colorful slimes, crabs, armored knights of many varieties, sizes and styles, pumpkins, zombie dogs, wizard eyeballs, bats, horseheads, mushrooms, bats, goofy-eyed water thugs, werewolves, specter ghosts, Kirby-like silktails, rabites, porcupine-like enemies called needlions, and more) are plentiful enough to spice up the average surroundings, and of course the bosses are REALLY varied and frequent.  On a personal note it bothers me the way the zombie dogs die.  They fall over so realistically that it makes me cry to see them lose their lives!  Oh and the bosses consist of giant two-headed dragons, lizards, giant bulky Gigas which are reminiscent of oversized dwarves, a gypsy snake, a giant glob of slime, deceivingly tiny bosses that look more like regular enemies called Tonsole and Biting Lizard and even a robot.  Talk about a HUGE variety!\n\nOverall really amazing RPG.  I strongly recommend it despite a few flaws.","summary":"secret of success","unixReviewTime":1411516800,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

While all the characters and scenery are done with bright, vibrant colors, and much of the music is cheery and uplifting, there is an underlying theme of sorrow that traces its way through the story in a very complimentary fashion.  Personally I feel it is a great parallel to what is going on in the real world, in the sense that as beautiful and wonderful and mentally absorbing as nature is, there are villains behind the scenes who seek to destroy it by using up natural resources.  The interactions and dialogue between the game's characters in general are somewhat limited for an RPG, but the combination of intense visuals and intuitive music, along with the heavy natural themes, seem to add a layer of depth and understanding that requires no verbal explanation.  Most of the environments are wilderness areas of some sort, and many of the enemies resemble real animals, though I suppose they are supposed to be evil versions since you must kill them to earn points.  The movements of the Mana Seeds affect the natural environment directly, and spirits representing elements such as Fire, Earth, Water, and Wind add an extra level of personification to mother earth.  All of these things make you care very much about the outcome of this world's struggles, and about the survival of the Mana Tree.  All in all, the atmosphere of this game is fantastic.  The Pure Land, I might add, is on my top ten list of imaginary places I would love to go, and\/or take up residence.\n\nMy only real problem with this game is the lack of complexity in the playable characters' stories.  Their beginning and end stories are very interesting, but there isn't very much in between; they really sort of silently put their heads down and plow through with their duties.  While this is an admirable character trait in anyone, real life or not, it makes the middle part of this game feel more like a single-player game than an RPG.  I like all of the characters, but I wish they had more complicated stories.  I also was somewhat baffled at the varied amounts of power orbs available for the different weapons; I found myself able to upgrade my Javelin higher than I thought possible, but my Gloves fell short one orb.  However, I found out recently that the cause for this has to do with random treasure chests towards the end of the game, and is not a bug, as I had previously thought.\n\nSecret of Mana is definitely worth a play if you can get your hands on it.  It is a pleasantly long game with a variety of settings, tasks to accomplish, interesting NPCs, and real-time battles in which you can experiment with a variety of attacks.\nThe gameplay is easy, and the graphics are beautiful.

It fits all the criteria: Oddball game design that most mainstream gamers will find too strange for their liking, lacking sales and critical disapproval at the time of it's release, a small-but-devoted following, hefty price tag, constant rumors about incredibly rare beta versions, sequels, etc., and most importantly, a really interesting game underneath.\n\nEarthbound is a traditional 16-bit RPG dragged through an insane LSD and pop culture gutter. The swords and staves are replaced with frying pans and yo-yo's. The fantasy worlds of Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger are replaced with a modern-day world with a zany sense of humor. You fight against hippies, businessman, ants, mushrooms, and abstract art. You order \"zombie paper\" from a pizzeria to save a zombie infested town. And you recieve your opening mission statement from a...bee. Not only do these ideas keep the game fresh, they also are used to satirize many of the more overly serious aspects of RPGs.\n\nThe battle system is pretty basic, but it works well, with character-unique abilities, PSI powers, and a \"roll-back\" H.P. system that rewards players with fast fingers. The lack of random battles is also a welcome surprise. Be warned, though: the game is unusually tough, and is very unforgiving towards unprepared or impatient players. With a little practice, however, you'll be able to tackle the more threatening battles without getting too banged up.\n\nThere are a few flaws: Mainly, the items don't stack, meaning you're oftentimes running out of room to place things. Also, the diffuclty could be adjusted so that the normal enemies are easier and the bosses are harder, but it's not too much of a problem.\n\nAnyone who is tired of \"normal\" video games should check this one out, but be prepared to search abit, or pay upwards of $75.","summary":"The Game Behind The Cult","unixReviewTime":1151712000,"vote":"7","style":null,"image":null}

Firstly this game does a lot right to a causal player of the arcade game you will think this is an exact clone. Secondly the players controls are hear and I sort of remember being more responsive and yet very true to the arcade feel.  Thirdly most SNES arcade ports suffer due to graphical capabilities of an SNES vs an arcade board this game looks almost identical to the arcade.  Now the bad or in between, first off Kohami as they always do changed one of the bosses they got rid of the boss who essentially was a mud monster.  Secondly the game is easier than it's arcade version also enemies in the arcade kind of teleport or something after you been them vs explode on the SNES.  Thirdly some characters have changed the characters are not exactly better or worse.  Fourthly no 4 player mode my understanding is that there was also a 2 player turtles in time board so to be fair it's not always a 4 player game anyway.  Fifth difference is no corky sound effects like in the arcade if you hit the fire hydrant the turtles says cool off sucker, however if you go down the sewer your turtle will still say this cave is creepy.  Now all and all are you going to honestly buy a arcade system or just be like most and accept this game is basically turtles in time.  Now for a rad retro gamer who wants the cartridge only you are going to buy this people with newer systems good news.

Actually this one isn't a perfect translation either. The SNES version is missing some digitized voices, a little robot in the second level that punches you, and a sample of the Pizza Power song. Some other chages are also made: April blinks onto the screen and yells \"Fight!\" (written, of course) when you lollygag as opposed to Splinter running across the screen telling you to hurry up, you fight Slash instead of a mud man in the Prehistoric level, you fight Rocksteady and Bebop on the ship level instead of Toka and Razar (who you fight in the Technodrome), you use surfboards in the sewer instead of just walking on water, and you fight the Rat King instead of Leatherhead in the Sewer level. It's not all bad though. Some of the levels are longer, there are new levels entirely, and you can fight a friend in training mode. A playable April would have been nice, but at least she doesn't get kidnapped again.\nAnywho, although the title may be (sic) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time, that's only because there were three TMNT games previously released on the original Nintendo Entertainment System (not counting Tournament Fighters).

Only those who thrive on high difficulty, intense challenges and hours of grueling game play can withstand it. Super Ghouls N Ghosts is part of that legendary series. Super Ghouls N Ghosts was a classic SNES title released in 1991. This game made boys into men...and then those same men back into boys. Those who knew about the Ghosts N Goblins series dared to play this game.\n\nYou play as Arthur, a brave knight, who sets out to rescue his girlfriend\/princess from the clutches of Lucifer. You must go through multiple stages and battle many enemies before you face off with the big boss himself. Then, in a horrific twist, you must go through the stages once again, and this time you must find a specific weapon. If you do not, you will not be able to go all the way. No game messes with the minds of gamers and hits you with intense difficulty quite like the Ghosts and Goblins games; Super GnG holds up this tradition proudly.\n\nThe PROS: This game has great graphics, music and sound effects. Controls are easy from the get go so no worries since you will be focused on getting through the stages. Capcom added a new double jump feature to get through sections of gaps thus added even more variety in the game play. You won't be able to beat the game in one setting so they added a set number of continues and if you get a lot of points, you can increase it as well.\n\nThe CONS: If there is one thing that I can say here is that this game is HARD. You will not beat this game in a few dozen tries. You will scream. You will get angry. You might break your controller in half. You might end up tossing your Super NES against a wall or out the window. If you don't like incredibly and brutally difficult games, do not buy this! Consider yourself warned.\n\nSuper Ghouls N Ghosts is truly a unique game. On one hand, you have a action platform game that is great to play and carries on the reputation of the Ghosts N Goblins series. On the other hand, it is so brutally hard and unforgiving that only certain gamers who thrive off on that stuff will truly enjoy themselves. I cursed the name of the game for every time I played it.

While the graphics are good, unfortunately this title suffers from some heavy slowdown. Although it can be annoying, sometimes its not a bad thing and can allow you time to better take view of the hundreds of bullets and enemies coming your way to plan your aerial strategy.\n\nPerhaps my favorite part of the game is the option to customize the power-ups for your Vic Viper at the beginning. In other words, instead of choosing between a few predetermined \"rows\" of power-ups, you can change each individual stage and mix and match. For example, maybe you want the Hawkwind missles, but you don't want the laser guns and would rather have the ripple gun. You can change that. Gradius III features all of the goods that the Gradius franchise has to offer, great power-ups, imaginative level design, a moai stage (with giant moai boss)and more.

A few times around a track and you quickly over come the interace issues. From that point on you become a better driver and the game continues to become fun, rather than a struggle to drive using an awkward controller set (as some racing games do).\nFour out of five stars, because I really like the control, options, and the graphics are above average.\nThe bad\/and things to consider - The game is hard and it is a simulation (not arcade like) - If you want the most graphicly appealing racing game for dreamcast this is not you stop.

However, in some areas in the several tracks, the lighting is so dim I cannot see turns clearly.  The game frame rate seems just a bit slow so I don't feel adrenalized driving a car at 80-100 mph in the city.  Also, when you bump into barriers, the car just stops, it won't bounce back or spin the car around.  Not that I've ever ran into walls in real life, but, MSR just doesn't seem to have that realism I'd imagine.  Alright, so, I've been negative about this game.  But, I am glad to have purchased it.  I've played many many racing games, both on PlayStation and Dreamcast (big names like GranTurismo 1&2, Tokyo Extreme Racer 2, Test Drive Lemans, etc .  MSR is one of the most interesting as well as enjoyable racing games to play.  There's something about racing in the city that's different from a racing on a circuit track.  There are more surprises and possibilities to do well or screw-up in the streets.  MSR, I'm sure you've heard, is not about how fast you drive, it's about how you drive fast. You need precision and lots of practice to win kudos but with the game's great controls you should be able to drive quite well after a few run.  The game can keep you addicted as you try to unlock new tracks and cars.  The game play is simple and tight.  The driving is solid.  The graphics are great.

In fact, they usually [smell](the only good one I've played before \"Crash Team Racing\" was that old game \"Wipeout\"). This game was rather good for a racing game, but the only reason why I bought it was because it was a Crash game, and I've been following the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy since the very beginning.\nThis game has good graphics and power-ups, but sometimes it's quite difficult, like when you have to acquire Gems and CTR Tokens by going through impossibly difficult levels in a very short amount of time. The best thing about this, I think, was the story(which is one thing that \"Mario Kart 64\" didn't have at all). The story for this game was good because of it's uniqueness. Instead of having to battle Dr. Cortex and Uka Uka again, Crash has to challenge a new enemy, an alien named Nitros Oxide, to a race that will decide the fate of the Earth itself. Not only that, but this sudden turn of events forces Crash and Cortex to actually team up for the first time ever(except ofcourse if for some reason you consider Cortex fooling Crash to acquire the Crystals for him in Part 2 \"teaming up\"). Not only that, but Crash and Cortex's friends and minions( Coco, Polar, Tiny, Dingodile, etc.) also join in to make sure Nitros Oxide doesn't take over the world for himself and leave Cortex out of it.\nI would give this game 3 and a half stars, but I gave it a 4 cause, as I've said before, I love Crash to much to give him a 3.","summary":"Pretty good for a racing game","unixReviewTime":1021420800,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

As developers made sure that certain titles were released for both systems, Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers was one of those titles. It was released in 1994 and was based on the fan favorite arcade game of the same name. While Street Fighter and fighting games in general fans debated on who had the best version, there was no doubt that it was a good port that came very close to mimicking the arcade game. No matter which system you had, gamers everywhere rejoiced and they had good reason.\n\nMost people know the drill already about Super Street Fighter II: you pick one of out 16 fighters, battle 12 others fighters including the bosses to win the game and score as many points as possible. On top of the main mode, Capcom added 2 player VS mode, group battle mode and tournament mode to round out the complete package. These extra modes further the replay value of this game so anyone can get into it.\n\nThe PROS: While there are a few things here and there that were omitted so the game can fit onto the cartridge, this game is a near perfect port. The graphics are good enough, the music sounds decent and the controls are spot on. You can set the difficulty level from 0 to 10 stars so it can be super easy to super hard to play. All of the fighters and their stages have made it in and with 2 player support, you can have a friend join in anything for a match. The extra modes are great to get other people around as the controller gets passed around so everyone gets his\/her turn to play.\n\nThe CONS: As stated already, there were some things omitted. Missing frames of animation, certain announcements were cut, bonus stages are from the previous SNES Street Fighter games and the sound effects are not as clear compared to the arcade game. But that is to be expected and it's just minor flaws considering they got everything else.\n\nIt was a great time to be into fighting games. Street Fighter fans couldn't get enough of it and played Super Street Fighter II in the comfort of their homes. If you're not into fighting games, then you won't want to check this out. But if you like fighting games, you'll want to get this.

It was so great that it made the Mortal Kombat series look like a broke franchise (but wait until Midway is done with Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance !). No matter what new and interesting Street Fighter Capcom makes today, including the VS series, no other Street Fighter game would be better than the Street Fighter II series. While things needed to be changed during the year of 1994, Capcom has decided to make yet another addition to their popular SFII franchise. After the successful release of Street Fighter II Turbo for the Super Nintendo, Capcom has released Super Street Fighter II for the Arcade, Super Nintendo, and Sega Genesis. A lot of fans had agreed that this is a true Street Fighter hit, but a lot of people had noticed some in-game flaws while playing, but we'll get back to that later ! For now, here's the lowdown ! The graphics of the SNES version of Super Street Fighter II looks great and little better than the Genesis version. As always, the animations still retain its old glorified 1992-1993 goodness ! As for the sound, this is where the problem begins. Sure the songs sound perfectly remixed on each stage, but just listen to the voice acting on some of the characters. Some of them sound weird and they don't fit the character at all, but not all of them. Just Guile, Dee Jay, and Sagat (including that annoying announcer). I tried not to pay any attention to the sound, but it's too noticeable. As for the lineup of new and old Street Fighters, the best collection of fighters I've ever seen. You still get classic numbers from the SFII universe like Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Guile, Blanka, Dhalsim, Zangief, Balrog, Sagat, Vega, and M. Bison. Plus some new fighters like Fei Long, Cammy, Dee Jay, and T. Hawk (if you want to know who they are, read my Genesis review of SSFII). And as always, anything bearing the name Street Fighter II, has the best gameplay balance of any 2D fighting game. The controls are slick and easy to master once you've played the SFII series numerous times. No flaws, just pure gameplay perfection. And it's even better than the playability of the Genesis version, considering the fact that the SNES controller had a wide variety of buttons than the Genesis pad. If you've played the previous SFII games, that's the way how the game plays. This may seem like the last Street Fighter II, but actually it isn't. The last of the SFII series was Super Street Fighter II Turbo which released for US arcades, but never for home consoles for some reason. It released on the Dreamcast in Japan somewhere around 2001 as Super Street Fighter II X: Grandmaster Challenge and it also released for the Game Boy Advance as Super Street Fighter II: Turbo Revival. Not to mention, it was featured on the Street Fighter compilation for the PlayStation called \"Street Fighter Collection\". This was the first Street Fighter to use Super moves, but since it was 1994 or 1995, the super bar can only last for one level. It was better than the early Super Street Fighter II, but it could've been cool if it had released on home consoles on that day. Oh well ! Just as long as it released on specific systems ! Anyways, if you're looking for a Street Fighter game, this is the one to look for ! Even with its flaws, the game itself is fun and long lasting like the other Street Fighter games !","summary":"Slightly better than the Genesis version with the same flaws","unixReviewTime":1027468800,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Executing the special moves were a bit of a challenge for me at first , but I relied on that instruction book 100% of the time and I learned to master the ha-do-kens, dragon punches, sonic booms, whirl wind kicks, and yoga fires in no time.  I've acutally first played Street Fighter II in the arcades, but I had no idea on what I was doing and didn't have too many quarters to be waisting on figuring out the moves.  This was one of the first fighting games ported on a 16 bit (or any) console and the graphics were true to the arcades.  My favorites characters to use were of course Ryu and Ken and both have amazing endings, however you must finish the game on normal or hard in order to achieve an individual ending for each of the eight characters.  The harder the difficulty level, the better the game.  Chung Li, Blanka, and Guile were great choices too (as fast, agile, powerful, and easy to use as Ryu and Ken).  Since there are unlimited continues on Street Fighter II, you have the option to practice on defeating your challengers from around the world, plus take on the bosses Saget, Vega, Balrog, and M. Bison (the main villian\/antagonist of the game who happened to murder Chung Li's dad and Guile's best friend, Charlie).  I would only recommend purchasing this game for true old school gamers.  Street Fighter II Turbo and Super Street Fighter II are definitley worth your money and more superior.  The Champion Edition on Sega Genesis has a better soundtrack, but I gave it a bad review due to a missing pause button and limited contol buttons.  Because of that, I consider the Super NES version the better out of the Original Street Fighter II console releases.","summary":"Street Fighting Fun!","unixReviewTime":1360368000,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

This game is, of course, the one that started the one-on-one fighting game craze, inspiring at least about a million imitators. I thought it was a very fun game back then, and I still like it, although it's very limited by today's standards. (I haven't actually played the SNES cartridge version in a long time, but I have the game on a few game-collection discs for PS1 and PS2.) Most of the characters only have a couple of \"Special\" moves (the Ha-Do-Ken, Dragon Kick, Sonic Boom, Yoga Fire, etc.); you don't have meters that let you use super-special moves. But in my opinion, the area where the game suffers most (today, at least; it didn't seem so bad at the time the game first came out) is the character selection itself, which is tiny or even almost nonexistant compared to the character selections of most later fighting games, with only eight fighters --- Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Guile, Dhalsim, Zangief, Blanka, and E. Honda --- to choose from; you can't play as the bosses (Balrog, Vega, Sagat, and M. Bison). And, when you consider that Ryu's and Ken's moves are EXACTLY the same in this game, the selection actually becomes even smaller, in a way. My favorite character was Dhalsim, because he was so stretchy and and could breathe fire! My least favorite playable character was Zangief, because I found him so hard to work with. I believe I beat the game at least a time or two, but it was probably with the game at an easy difficulty setting! I'm giving the game positive ratings, really more because it was a childhood favorite of mine than for any other reason; it's still a good game, especially if you're waxing nostalgic, but it has been WAY outdone by many other fighting games, both within and without the SF series.","summary":"the one that started it all!","unixReviewTime":1339200000,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

The first game in the series made a little bit of noise and had a cult following leading up to the release of the second game to the arcades. Who knew that history was being made as SF II gave birth to the fighting game genre and revolutionized video games at the same time. Everyone went crazy as soon as they played this game to death while mastering all of the characters' moves, combos & strategies; players were sharing what they knew or found out between each other. No other arcade game had such a deep and devoted following and created tournament style gaming like Street Fighter II. Then, Capcom shocked everyone by announcing a port of Street Fighter II was coming to the SNES and it was released in 1992. This port was revolutionary for its time because while Capcom made changes to the game, the core essence remained and it was still as fun to play as it was in the arcades.\n\nStreet Fighter II is a fighting game where you face off against the computer in a series of matches that lead up to the game's main villain, M. Bison. You choose from one of eight characters, face off against the other 7 characters, then you go up against 4 boss characters (including M. Bison.) Each character has his\/her own storyline and ending so you find out their specific reasons for wanting to fight M. Bison. After every third match, you enter a bonus stage where you get to earn additional points before the timer runs out (there are 3 bonus stages in total.) The game features a 2 player vs. mode so you can take on another human player but you can only choose from the 8 characters and not the additional boss characters. Finally, there is an option screen where you can change the buttons on your controller, play audio tracks from the game and adjust the difficulty level of the game. As an added bonus, there's a code you can use where both players can use the same character in a match.\n\nThe PROS: This was revolutionary because they took an arcade game that was 58 megabits in size and shrunk it down into a 16 mega-bit cartridge. While changes were made, it looked and sounded close to what the arcade game was. On top of that, the controls were perfect. The game used every button on the SNES controller so Capcom did not have to compromise the button scheme at all. The rules of the arcade game were the same as the SNES port so you weren't missing out at all as far as how your character moves or what strategies to use against the computer or another human player. The same character code was such a sweet bonus as it was NOT featured in the Street Fighter II arcade game.\n\nThe CONS: Like I said before, this is not a perfect port. In order for the game to retain the same feel, Capcom had to make changes across the board for this game to fit and work properly. There are too many to list but it doesn't hurt the overall experience too much as there were people who never got the chance to play it in the arcades. For them, buying this game for the SNES was a perfect way to find out what the hype was all about. What is surprising is that when you put the difficulty level to its highest point, it is 100 times harder than the arcade game so only the most skilled SF players were able to defeat M. Bison at the highest difficulty level.\n\nIt was a great time to have the SNES as Capcom would release a port of Street Fighter II: Champion Edition for the Sega Genesis more than a year after Street Fighter II was released for the SNES. Not only did fighting games become popular, but the gap between the quality of arcade games and their ports to home consoles became smaller and it was starting to become common to see popular arcade games ported to SNES, Genesis, etc. If by chance, you have never played any of the earlier Street Fighter II games, you can either pick up a used SNES copy, look for the numerous Street Fighter anthology collections that are out there or download this title for the Wii via their Virtual Console service for 800 points (US $8.) I recommend you try it out if you haven't done so yet.","summary":"Revolutionary for its time","unixReviewTime":1316044800,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

I love the way the game works: when you are in a grapple with your opponent you press all the buttons as quickly as you can, to try and deliver a move!  It's incredibly fun but if you consider yourself to be someone not fast on the controller you WILL find this to be a difficult task.\n\nUnfortunately, you pretty much HAVE to grapple your opponent (by standing next to them and hitting the X button) because simply punching and kicking them for an entire match won't get the job done.  In fact, many times the second you punch or kick your opponent, they want to put you in a grappling hold, forcing you to quickly press all the buttons to either deliver a move, or break free.\n\nWWF Raw is such a good game, though.  It's also much better than the previous game (WWF Royal Rumble) in every single way.  Now, not only do you have finishing moves, you also have SUPER moves (moves that would be impossible to perform in real-life).  To give you an example of a SUPER move: Bret Hart spins around a bunch of times off a turnbuckle before landing on your opponent, or the 1-2-3 Kid bouncing back and forth on the top two turnbuckles.  Or how about Bam Bam Bigelow turning into Superman and VERY quickly charging across the ring?  That's just a few of the incredible SUPER moves you will see in this game.  Of course you also have finishing moves for each wrestler, such as Bret Hart and Owen Hart's Sharpshooter, Razor Ramon's Razor's Edge and the Undertaker's Tombstone Piledriver, to name a few.  Please note that neither SUPER or finishing moves are required to defeat your opponent.  You don't have to perform them.\n\nLet's not forget about all the REGULAR moves that have been added.  There weren't NEARLY this many in WWF Royal Rumble.  Any one of the buttons on the Super NES controller in a grappling hold will deliver a different move.  That's awesome.\n\nThis game has really exciting options.  There's a lot of them to choose from, also.  The Royal Rumble option is still my very favorite feature (where you have 6 wrestlers in the ring at once, and the object is to throw all of them over the top rope and to the outside of the ring, until ONE man is left standing- this is VERY fun, and yes, it's exactly the same as the Royal Rumble option in the previous game).\n\nThe Tag-Team and Bedlam touraments will always remain *extremely* awesome because there's a bunch of ways you and your partner can defeat your opponents.  You can pin them, you can count them out of the ring, you can tag your partner so HE can deliver the pinfall, and many more ways.\n\nThe music is always diverse and interesting, and in some cases, very close to the way it sounds in a real WWF arena (WWE, today) such as Bam Bam Bigelow, Razor Ramon, and Owen Hart's theme.\n\nYou also couldn't ask for a better selection of wrestlers.  You have your tall, tough guys like the Undertaker and Diesel, the overweight guys (Bam Bam Bigelow and Yoko Zuna) the technical wrestlers (Bret Hart and Owen Hart) and the funny goofy wrestlers, such as Doink and Lex Luger.  I don't know what category you'd place Shawn Michaels, possibly the best wrestler in the game.\n\nThis game has it all, and it's a shame they don't make wrestling games like this anymore.  Today, wrestling games are all about realism, which means the market is flooded with games that are all basically the same thing, only with minor updates with each release.  A waste of money THOSE games are.\n\nI could keep talking about WWF Raw on the Super NES forever.  The fun I have smacking my opponents head with a bucket or chair, the surprise of facing someone one-on-one and having someone come out in the middle of the match to interfere (forcing me to face TWO wrestlers), the fun of running into\/punching the referee, throwing my opponent into the turnbuckle and repeatedly running into them, throwing my opponent out of the ring and repeatedly into the gate on the left and right side of the ring (or the side of the ring itself!).  Man, so much fun.  BUY THIS GAME NOW!","summary":"ultimate WWF game for the Super NES","unixReviewTime":1075593600,"vote":"4","style":{"Platform:":" Nintendo Super NES"},"image":null}

But the game was very well received. For the first time digitized actors replaced hand-drawn fighters, the action looked very realistic and most of all, it took violence in a video game to a standard that had never been reached before. It all lead to the inevitable release of Mortal Kombat II, which is widely considered the best and most original of the series.\nThe SNES version is probably the best home conversion available. Everything from the arcade version is included, from blood and gore to fatalities and hidden characters. The story behind the game is fresh. At the end of the first tournament, Liu Kang has managed to defeat Shang Tsung and banish him to the \"Outworld\".\nTsung's master, Shao Kahn, has restored Tsung's youth in exchange for a plan to lure the earth warriors to a tournament held in the Outworld itself. This tournament is none other than Mortal Kombat II.\nMK2 introduces a host of new kombatants including Kung Lao, Jax, Kitana, Mileena, Baraka and the now playable Reptile and Shang Tsung. The original fighters return, minus Sonya and Kano. Each fighter has at least two fatalities, plus a friendship and a babality! The old guys have been polished up a bit and given some new moves to match them with the new ones. There are two brand new bosses. The first is Kintaro, who is of the same clan of creatures as Goro from the original, but is far more powerful. The second is Shao Kahn, who's insults are his own downfall.\nWhat the MK series is really known for is the finishing moves, and MK2 manages to satisfy any lust you would have for blood! These make MK1 look tame! Especially violent are Johnny Cage's torso rip, Jax's arm rip and face smash and Baraka's blade lift. New to the series are Friendships (in which the winner shows his friendship towards the loser) and babalities (in which the loser is turned into an infant). Three new stage fatalities are present as well! Two brand new secret characters are present and will appear during the game giving various clues. They are of course, Smoke and Jade. Unfortunately you can't play as them, but only fight them.\nA noticable weakness of the game is the irritating scratching sound that almost always appears when something is announced. The music is also not much in the quality department, but then again, Mortal Kombat was never known for its music. The visuals were pretty amazing for it's time, but will hardly impress anyone today. Controls, though responsive are a bit awkward. The characters tend to slide too much.\nAnyway after all these years, it can still be quite addicting. SNES owners looking for worthy fighting games should pick this up. You might also want to try MK3 (but not Ultimate MK3 please...). If you are a fan of Mortal Kombat 4, then you will undoubtedly enjoy this. For the ultimate in SNES fighting games however, consider Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting.","summary":"A pretty good fighting game, at least for its time...","unixReviewTime":1004140800,"vote":"10","style":{"Platform:":" Nintendo Super NES"},"image":null}

Games like Spiderman and the X-Men Arcade's Revenge or Spiderman Return of the Sinister Six were pretty lousy. Finally, a good Spiderman game is on the horizon, with gamers also being given the very cool choice of playing as Venom for a few levels.\n\nFirst off, this game is better on Super Nintendo than it is on Sega Genesis. The Genesis copy is still a fun game, but because the framerate and the sound is better on the SNES, I would recommend to serious gamers interested in this game that they pick up the SNES copy. On top of that, the SNES red cartridge is very attractive. For the life of me I will never understand why The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past on SNES was never produced as a gold cartridge. After seeing Maximum Carnage's red cartridge, I figured that SNES was capable of colored cartridges. In the case of Zelda, they simply just chose not to do a gold cartridge. Anyway, the Genesis also had a limited edition red cartridge, but it just isn't as attractive as the SNES red cartridge.\n\nSo the game is based off the 14-part comic book series of the same title. Instead of cut-scenes, we get to see panels from the comic books to help move the story along. In the first few levels, you take the role as Spiderman as you go around beating up bad guys in New York City. Spiderman can shoot webs to ensnare enemies or pull them towards him (similar to Mortal Kombat's Scorpion's harpoon move). Spiderman can also climb walls or swing away from trouble with a web. And of course, Spiderman is perfectly capable of some very excellent and acrobatic street fighting moves to defend himself against typical wave after wave of enemies in side-scroller beat em up action. The game keeps track of your accuracy, and if you land enough hits without missing, Spiderman will be capable of executing a \"power move\" to take out a bunch of enemies or execute a single enemy.\n\nAiding Carnage's campaign of terror in New York City are his friends Shriek, Doppelganger, Demogoblin, and Carrion. These enemies all have their own methods of attacking, and you will find yourself fighting them two at a time multiple times throughout the game. But Spiderman and Venom have some friends of their own to help out, such as Black Cat, Captain America, Firestar, Ironfist, Cloak, Dagger, Morbius, and Deathlok. You will find tokens which will allow you to call on them to attack the on-screen enemies.\n\nAfter a few levels, you will finally be given the choice to pick whether you want to play as Spiderman or Venom. Both characters have their plusses and their minuses. Spiderman is more acrobatic and faster, while Venom sacrifices the speed for raw power. In that instance, it is just a matter of personal preference. However, the levels will play out differently based on whom you choose to play as. If you choose to play as Venom whenever given a choice, you will have a much shorter game since Venom spends a significant amount of time being captured and tortured by Carnage in the Statue of Liberty.\n\nSo the toughest part of the game is continuously dealing with Carnage and his friends, especially since they become progressively more aggressive and tougher in the later stages of the game. Doppelganger becomes a step quicker, but Shriek becomes a hellion with her sonic blasts in the late stages of the game. Demogoblin is always tough due to his ability to jump on his glider if you don't stay on top of him, and Carrion will always be a nuissance floating around waiting for his chance to sap some of your strength.\n\nCarnage on the other hand, is the toughest of all. You will fight him several times, and some of his attacks do considerable damage. During the last encounter you will have a difficult time drawing a bead on him because of his double-armed swinging axe maneuver, which can rob you of a full life if you are unfortunate enough to be in the way. Be patient and pick your openings.\n\nThis game takes a bit of practice to master. Although the typical action fights are pretty simple, the boss battles may have you begging for mercy at some points. Once you know where all the 1-ups and continues are though, you should be fine as long as you remember to rely on your help tokens for the boss battles.\n\nAll in all, this is quite a fun game. It isn't the best side scroller beat em up, and of course it doesnt compare to some true classics like Streets of Rage 2 or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV Turtles in Time, but for a better than average side-scroller beat em up, it's hard to go wrong with Maximum Carnage, especially for Spiderman fans.","summary":"Spiderman And Venom Team Up!","unixReviewTime":1320537600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

It was gory and fun as hell. If you missed it because you were too young, you should definitely try this one out on the PS3 on PSN.\n\nMortal Kombat II upped the character amount, the gory fatalities and all of the game's ruthlessness. Old favorites such as Raiden, Lui Kang, Scorpion, Sub-Zero and Johnny Cage make their return here while newcomers like Mileena, Kitana, Jax and Baraka made the game much cooler than its predecessor. The graphics were crisper and made more colorful, the sounds more varied and the settings much more detailed\/eerie. The game was just an all-around delight to experience.\n\nNot everything was perfect, however. The main thing I'd like to say about this game that brings the score down  is the difficulty. Playing through on Normal was somewhat tolerable, but any higher and the game gets damn ruthless. You would find yourself dying over and over again even if you were just facing the second person up the totem pole. To this day, I still haven't completed this game in all of its difficulties and I have no desire to. The game just gets too cheap too soon. But that's what 2-player mode is for!\n\nAll in all, still one of the best fighting games you could ever ask for. It had nice graphics for its time, contains my two favorites characters (Sub-Zero and Kitana), introduced Babalities and just made the series that much harder to live up to itself later on. III was solid, but it wasn't II. Deadly Alliance was great but it (as well as some of the characters) didn't have the same \"umph\". When in doubt, II it is!\n\nA near classic!\n\nOverall score ------> 4.25\/5\n\n(This review can also be found at gamespot. com under the name darksongbird)","summary":"One of the best fighting game sequels ever made.","unixReviewTime":1317772800,"vote":null,"style":{"Platform:":" Nintendo Super NES"},"image":null}

Most video games based off movies aren't good.  Most of them are, in fact, horrible.  However, Toy Story manages to stay at the top of its game long enough for any gamer to admit it is an overall good game.\n\nYou play as Woody, traveling through the full length story of Toy Story.  The game is comprised of seventeen levels with story sequences in between.  Most levels are basic side scrollers where you'll progress through the level as Woody with a few bosses in there.  The levels range in variety.  Not just basic side scroll levels, but there are a couple of levels where you'll control RC and a few levels where you'll be riding on a certain toy to get through a barage of obstacles in your way.  Woody's \"life gauge\" is at the top of the screen.  He has five hit points.  When they're all used up you'll have to restart the level.  Luckily, throughout these levels there are checkpoints for Woody to fall back on.\n\nThere are fifty stars in each and every level of Toy Story.  They're scattered around much like coins in Mario.  If you get fifty Woody will get an extra life.  If you come close he might get a few hit points restored instead.  The levels aren't long and some of them are fairly simple to go through.\n\nGraphically, Toy Story looks really good for a Super Nintendo game.  The freeze frame scenes from the move are of the actual movie itself, and Woody and the other toys move quite smoothly.  There are a few frame rate issues from time to time.  Moments when Woody will abruptly slow down but the action around him doesn't.  This could cost you more than a few hit points.  Some levels, such as controling RC, are downright frustrating.\n\nThe music is a tough call.  It isn't exactly the greatest sound track but it isn't bad either.  It would've been nice if they'd borrowed more tunes from the movie.  The music doesn't get repetative (there's different music for each and every level) but it just doesn't always sound great.  Not only that, but some of the story sequences are horribly written.\n\nThe game does present a good challenge, however, as most classic Super Nintendo games.  You'll find yourself in trouble a few times.  However, I have to point out that even for a Super Nintendo game it's short.  For a late Super Nintendo it's short.  The game can be completed within a half hour.  Compare that with other SNES games (that aren't RPGs) that take at least 5 or 6 hours to beat and you'll wonder if Toy Story is really worth the time.  I'd say it is.  It's fun, and it's interesting.  For Super Nintendo junkies, you might want to get a hold of it.  It's actually a game based off a movie that's good, and that alone deserves a peak.  Just be glad that it's an old SNES game that actually comes at a fair price.","summary":"Retrospectively Speaking, It's Good","unixReviewTime":1142985600,"vote":"9","style":null,"image":null}

While the mechanics of Danger Girl can't compare to Syphon Filter's highly intuitive, instantly comfortable controls, it has to its advantage a cast of great characters, good artwork, enjoyable voice work, and the Danger Girl franchise, which gives this game a more varied backdrop than usual.  Unfortunately the controls are really quite hard to grasp -- the \"toggle\" quality of the crouch and aim options (most games, Medal of Honor and Syphon Filter, let you aim only when you hold down the button, which makes more sense) makes controlling your character all the slower.  And your character onscreen really moves at a pathetic speed, so that most of the time evading enemy attack (and spotting the enemy in the first place) becomes annoyingly difficult.  What bugs me the most is the lack of a checkpoint system in this game, and the environments often are not what they seem -- eg. you can see a crack between the tree and the wall, but you won't be able to move past it, and your character will \"freeze\" if she hits a surface).

It's okay for casual players but harcore players will feel unsatisfied. The jumping feels a little off and sometimes you end up missing a platform or getting hurt by an enemy if your jump is at an angle. You only use two buttons, to jump and to attack. That is okay for something like NES, but the SNES has 4 more buttons that are gone unnoticed. I wish they could have added more to the control scheme, like a run button!\n\nThe replay value is still high though, but mostly for the nostalgic factor.

The music and sounds have a higher quality than the Genesis version, but there are loading times in between levels.\n\nThe first level takes you to the iconic Steamboat Willie cartoon. However, if you think that the first level is supposed to be simple, think again. There are numerous obstacles that are most likely to hurt you. If you get hit, you are only invincible for half a second. What makes the gameplay become fun is when you start collecting these spheres and then later throw them at enemies. You soon encounter ol' timey Pete, but he actually isn't the boss. Hit him 4 times and use him as a spring to bounce over a pile of crates. The REAL first boss is the machinery. You must destroy 4 gears by hitting them 5 times (3 times for the top ones) The boss, at first, plays incredibly hard, since the crates drop bombs on you. However, you don't find out til later to figure out that you can just jump to avoid getting blown up. After the boss, Mickey appears with Steamboat Willie. Then the text says \"Congratulations! Mickey has rescued Steamboat Willie!\" What? He was kidnapped?\n\nThe second level is, one of my favorites, The Mad Doctor. Right when you encounter a skeleton, things get hard. When the skeletons get destroyed, their bones fly up and fall down, but you actually had to avoid colliding with them. There are several portions of this level. After the first part, the second part contains rope swinging over lava. The third has you ride a runaway mine cart, but you must jump over the incoming spike balls. There's also this part where you must perform chemistry. The downside here is that if you push it to the stool without the 3 layers you have to put in, the only decision is to kill yourself. The Mad Doctor doesn't seem like a very hard boss until you attack. If hit, he throws full flasks all over the place.\n\nThe third level is Moose Hunters. If you don't follow Pluto on this one, you're dead. Countless tree branches and boulders would fall on you. Moose would also gallop towards you at certain times. After beating the first part, things get easier, yet awkward. You now have to run away from a moose in a beautifully stupid fake 3D level.\n\nThe Lonesome Ghosts is your fourth level. Going up certain staircases would make them turn into a ramp. There are tilting platforms that you must tilt in the right direction to go on. The second part is annoying. You have to balance on a barrel while the house is being flooded. As you make your way towards left, the third barrel would sink, but if you get closer to the left, the water stops. That's the annoying part: The water. If you jump in, you lose your life automatically basically.\n\nMickey and the Beanstalk is graphically colorful. There's not a lot of hard stuff in here. Although I must admit the dragonflies are annoying. When you get to the first huge enemy, you'd think it'd be a boss since boss music is playing, but no. You must hop on a ladybug. The ladybug speeds away from the \"boss\" extremely. Once you reach the giant's house, there's a plate with Jello on it. You have to push it towards the wall, but you probably won't know it at first, since it's a big object to push.\n\nNow...the Prince and the Pauper....it's the hardest and final level of the game. You swing, you kill, all that stuff. Unfortunately, I can't explain anymore since you must find about this on your own. Good luck.\n\nOverall, if you are a die-hard fan of platform games, Mickey Mouse, or you just want a major challenge, go ahead and buy this game.","summary":"Daring revisit through time","unixReviewTime":1293494400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Most of what I played were the sports' games, but every now and then I took a chance on something that looked interesting.\n\nI rented World of Illusion just to see what kind of sequel had been created for Castle of Illusion, and was impressed with some (for the time at least) very impressive video game console graphics, stunning artwork accompanied by music that gave the feel for the environment in which you, as Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck, explored.\n\nAs can be expected from a kids' game, it's somewhat easy, but it's got that kind of innocent fun and innocent adventure packed into it.

This is because I've finally convinced myself that lengthy storylines DO deserve a place in the video game genre.  When this game first came out I was busy enjoying either my Super NES or early action games on the PS1 such as Loaded, WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game and several others so I wasn't so willing to just open up and accept a very story-based video game since the concept was brand new to me at the time, and I resented the idea initially.  My logic was \"Um, shouldn't such detailed storyline be reserved for movies and books only?\" and the truth is I sometimes still feel the same way whenever I have to put up with a lengthy unskippable cutscene but you know times change and specifically video games have changed since the Super NES days, and we've pretty much reached the point where such stories HAVE to be included in video games for continuity reasons and for sequels to be made.  Also gameplay tends to feel stale nowadays so we look forward to stories above everything else (at least I feel this way).  I understand all this now.\n\nAnyway onto the review for Parasite Eve.  This game is just magnificent all around.  I think its biggest problem is being compared to the Resident Evil series which isn't really fair in my opinion, and specifically the enemies in Parasite Eve don't have the familiarity and worldwide love that zombies do.  People automatically veer towards zombies for some reason.  To me zombies are mostly overrated and often times come off as comical but I'm willing to make an exception when it comes to survival horror video games (at least in RE2 and 3 where zombies are actually terrifying while intensifying the mood and your surroundings).  However zombie movies are usually hit or miss for me and I don't quite get the love so many others do.  But the lack of everyone's precious zombie in Parasite Eve I believe (in my opinion) is a major contributor why this game never won over the majority of survival horror fans.\n\nThe first half of the game centers on a *very* detailed horror story about an evil demon woman named Eve who actually has the potential to make people burn to death suddenly and dramatically (spontaneous combustion).  Let me tell you guys something- I've watched some cool cutscenes before but NONE of them come even close to the one that takes place in an opera theater in the beginning of this game.  It's absolutely AWESOME to watch!  To go from singing opera to the audience burning alive a moment later... talk about catching me by *complete* surprise!  I love it!  This cutscene is so beautiful and elegant and yet so twisted and demented at the same time- way ahead of its time for 1997 since combining beauty with oddness and horror wasn't a popular trend in either video games or movies until a few years later (unless my foggy memory is forgetting a popular movie and I might just be).  It's possible that since Parasite Eve's story is so well-told it might have been heavily influenced from another source.\n\nAnyway the first half of the game is all about the story with only brief elements of gameplay in between, while the second half places more emphasis on gameplay (shooting enemies and progressing) and less on story (until the conclusion which is 45 minutes of heavy story).  Parasite Eve uses static camera angles and pre-rendered backgrounds just like classic Resident Evil with many different camera angles enhancing the mood.  What makes Parasite Eve work so well is its VERY detailed, elaborate and sophisticated storyline.  Every single detail related to the virus \"mitochondrial\" (a word you'll be hearing a LOT throughout this game- get used to it) and how this evil monster named Eve is preparing to make the \"Ultimate Being\" and will even kill or burn people alive who dare to stand in her way is not only engrossing by itself but when you include the main playable and attractive character of Aya who works at the police department and mysteriously is NOT affected by Eve's antics, a Japanese scientist who's here to sort out this mess and a firm-voiced detective named Daniel, you have yourself a small but ultimately VERY memorable cast of characters.  There's plenty of mini characters too including Daniel's son and a sick-minded scientist helping to feed Eve's desires for creating the perfect living creature, etc.\n\nAs you can guess, the storyline is LEAPS AND BOUNDS better than anything Resident Evil ever made, especially nowadays since the RE series is completely tarnished being an action-oriented game with generic unfitting Hollywood-ish segments that don't belong for the RE series, let alone the horror genre.  However compared to the classic RE games Parasite Eve destroys even those amazing games in terms of storyline.  Arguably the enemies are significantly better in Parasite Eve as well.  You encounter mutated oversized dogs, bears, insects, lizards, snakes, rats, dinosaurs and pterodactyl's (later on), etc.  These enemies often even have their own fireball or laser ball shooting moves which is quite unique to see in a grim survival horror setting.  Many of these enemies are downright frightening too.  Resident Evil's enemies are bland in comparison.  Aya, your main character, can carry several weapons and ammunition which smears what the classic RE games bring to the table in terms of arsenal variety.\n\nThe environments mostly consist of the police department, hospital,  museum, ship and snowy city streets.  It's really all the game needs.  If I have any complaints well, for one thing the storyline gets really confusing in the second half when Aya's sister and mother are mentioned and how they tie into the Eve situation which never *quite* made sense to me but it's possible I was just getting burnt out by the final chapter and not focusing clearly anymore.  It sort of bothers me how un-dramatic the enemy encounters are- you simply walk along minding your business when suddenly the screen flashes white and invisible enemies turn visible before your eyes and the battle gets underway while mid-tempo music lacking suspense plays.  It doesn't capture the fear of being stuck in a dreadful trap NEARLY as effectively as the classic RE games.  In RE the music doesn't change at all when enemies appear on screen, and the enemies are already there upon entering a room (often times in plain view or you can hear them walking around in the back of the room).  I certainly prefer enemy encounters the RE way. Also your health bar is like an RPG based on numbers.  When you get attacked your numbers go down.  I prefer the herb\/health status system in the RE games.  A lot of times enemies appear during aerial view camera shots which is probably a clever way of disguising game space limitations so there's more room to include more enemies.\n\nOverall however, this game is pretty awesome.  Perhaps its extremely big story means little replay value since you don't feel like plodding through such a large story just to get to the action parts which is understandable, but this game does everything right except for the way the enemy encounters are handled.  I LOVE any cutscene that either shows people burning alive or enemies such as rats or dogs transforming into beastly creatures which is quite graphic, gross and exciting.  Dare I say the best cutscenes ever in a PS1 game?  A really magnificent game.","summary":"watch out for that parasite","unixReviewTime":1411862400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

I was slightly less impressed, though it may be due to the slightly less-than-smooth translation and graphics, both of which can reasonably be expected from an old game such as this.\n\nI loved the battle system.  Like most RPGs, battles happen randomly throughout the game.  You operate off something similar to an ATB gauge.  However, you are able to move away from enemies and their attacks, then move in to attack with something powerful.  Also, you have to pay attention to the amount of ammo you are carrying.\n\nOutside of gameplay, controls can be a bit annoying.  You may find yourself (like me) searching a drawer 5 times, only to find something on the 6th time because you happened to be at just the right angle.  However, this shouldn't stop you from enjoying the game itself.\n\nThe characters are all interesting, each with a minimum of backstory.  The script, however, reads like a really bad 90's action flick.  Annoying, but workable.\n\nIf you're looking for scares, look somewhere else.  The gameplay runs more the route of suspense and disgust, and even that is at a minimum.\n\nAll in all, an enjoyable game, if you look past the flaws.","summary":"A quirky old game, but worth a play-through","unixReviewTime":1363219200,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

If epics like FFIV can be given 5 stars, then semi-epics like Breath of Fire have to be categorized differently.\n\nThis game has a lot of great features--a good battle system (with the exception of GUTS mode, which irritated me--just give enemies higher HP if it's gonna take so long to kill them); nice graphics, a pretty good story, and--the best part--VERY original characters.  The problem is, the dialogue is so drastically abbreviated that I couldn't feel very much about anything that was going on!  I can understand that there are capacity limits in making games, and that the makers can only do so much, but the dialog scenes?  All they have to do is insert a bunch of text, maybe a few flashbacks here and there--it's not like it would have been difficult to have the characters interact with each other more or explain their feelings better, or sometimes just explain what the heck was going on (example: every time you approach a human villain to fight them, when you go into the battle screen they're suddenly a monster!  I guess you're supposed to just assume that they've turned themselves into monsters by some magical power, but maybe that could've been explained a little better?).  I don't know--I'm sure a lot of people have had this problem while playing the game, and maybe it was really one of the best when it came out, but I recently replayed FFIV and even though the graphics and gameplay were on a similar level, there was a HUGE difference in the dramatic presentation of the story.  (Part of this may also have been that the music was better in FFIV.)\nIn short, if you are okay with an RPG feeling like the Legend of Zelda games--where you only have one character in your party and the game is all about performing quests that don't involve emotional scenes pertaining to your character, then you'll like Breath of Fire.  If you need more from an RPG, however--emotional cutscenes, drama between characters WITHIN your party and not just NPCs, etc.--then you probably wouldn't like this game.  My overall impression of it was just, \"Important NPC says one line telling you what to do.  Travel to next place, battle battle battle, go through five dungeons, battling all the way, retrieve artifact, battle your way back to town, get one or two lines of appreciation from the NPC who gave you the quest, and SOMETIMES (not always) a vague hint about what to do next.  Thing to do next: same as above, rinse and repeat.\"\n\nOh, and the music changing when you go from outside a house to the inside of a house annoyed the crap out of me. :)","summary":"Not as good as FF, but still decent","unixReviewTime":1256688000,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

The major differences here are the enhanced soundtracks, sound effects, and the addition of a Vs. Com Mode.  Sadly, you cannot play against the computer if you choose the Mixed Match game.  But otherwise, this game should leave you very puzzled -- in a good way.\n\nIn Tetris, you need to clear lines by placing Tetriminos (correct spelling??) on the bottom of the screen.  When you fill up a line, it clears and lowers the stack.  Try to get a Tetris by clearing 4 lines in a row.  In Type A (Marathon) Mode, you keep playing endlessly.  But watch out as you progress, because the Tetriminos will start to fall much faster!  I've managed to make it to Level 18-20, so it's a real doozy.  Type B Mode allows you to clear a set amount of lines, which is 25.  You can adjust the speed\/height level.\n\nIn Dr. Mario, you have a set amount of viruses to get rid of.

Ultimately, this makes this a unique game the likes of which I've never seen successfully repeated (yes, the sequel is quite bad).  That being said, I really enjoyed this game, and I'm sure you will too!\n\nGraphics (score 7\/10): The graphics look a bit dated by today's standards, and weren't even the absolute best for their time.  However, they look good enough, and are not too displeasing to the eye.  The CG cutscenes still look excellent, in my opinion, and do a good job of showcasing the freaky creatures that the game features.\n\nMusic (score 8\/10): I really love the music for this game; I even went and got the soundtrack because I enjoyed it so much.  My only complaint is that the opera scene in the game uses a synthesized vocal track which sounds absolutely hideous compared to the regular opera singer's voice on the soundtrack.  Why they didn't just use the un-synthesized song is beyond me.  Also of note is the excellent exploration-related sound effects.  I don't think I've ever heard squeakier, creepier door sounds in my life.  Yes, these sounds are a bit unnaturally loud, but they are well-suited to this type of game, and add to the creepiness factor.  Unfortunately, in battle sounds like gunshots are oddly muted--eve the rocket launcher is quiet.  One more thing--even though the music itself is great, there are times when it is strangely absent.  At times I can tell that the silence is used for dramatic effect, at other times it just seems random.  For instance, the Weapons Department of the police station (where I store my excess crap) almost always has no music, but the rest of the station does.  This makes no sense at all.  Oh well.  Rest assured that the negative points to the music really don't detract much from the overall fine experience.\n\nCharacters (score 8\/10): Aya is the main character, and the only character which you will get to control.  That being said, I really liked her and think she is more than capable of carrying the game alone.  Being a survival-horror sort of game, only having one character helps add to the feeling of loneliness and fear since you are on your own.  One thing I really like about Aya is that she is not treated like a stereotypical girly-girl nor as a blatant sex-object.  This unfortunately seems to happen a lot in games where the main character is female.  She is very much a believable no-nonsense cop.  After seeing too many games where the female characters fight while wearing mini-skirts and heels (who fights monsters in a mini-skirt?!), I've really started to appreciate the fact that the designers opted for realism in Parasite Eve and put Aya in jeans, sneakers, and a jacket.  It's really unusual to see such a believable female lead character, and I'm very pleased.  As for the other, supporting characters (and even Aya herself), they do not get a lot of background information or dialogue, and do not really get a lot of character development.  The other characters are really more archetypal characters, such as the workaholic cop who doesn't spend enough time with his family, or the nerdy, socially inept scientist.  Even though their personalities aren't deeply developed, you can still understand and relate to them as characters because you're familiar with the archetypes.  This lack of deeper characters normally wouldn't work in a traditional RPG, but the game pulls it off well because it is more story-driven.\n\nStory (score 9\/10): The story takes place in a fairly short amount of time (6 days), but it's very engaging.  True, the premise of sentient mitochondria is a bit far-fetched, but if you suspend your disbelief, the story is incredibly enjoyable.  Square did a good job of crafting a creepy tale full of hideous monsters that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.  The main storyline is great, but one thing I must point out (without spoiling anything) is that the bonus ending (for going through the Chrysler Building in the EX Game) is a real bust.  I felt so cheated after seeing that ending--it is way not worth the effort to get.  However if you stick to the main game, you're likely to have a great time.\n\nBattle System (score 10\/10): The game designers did a great job of blending action elements and turn-based gameplay to give us an enjoyable hybrid.  You can move Aya freely around during battle to dodge enemy attacks while waiting for your time bar to fill.  Once it's full, you hit the X button to bring up an attack menu and a grid.  The grid shows you the range of you're weapon.  Simple, yes?  Also, you can opt to open up your menu when you get your turn and use an item instead of attacking.  The game features many guns and armor which can be customized by using a \"tool\" to add features from one weapon\/armor onto another.  You also get bonus points when you level up which can be used to increase your inventory size, the speed of your time bar, or weapon\/armor stats.  Overall, I found the customization feature to be very enjoyable.\n\nGameplay (score 7\/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  One thing that I found annoying was Aya's running speed; it's like her feet are sticky or something because she runs really slowly.  Another thing that was a bit annoying is that the game has random battles, but they aren't exactly random.  There are \"hot spots\" on the floor that can trigger random battles if you happen to step in that area.  Unfortunately, these are somewhat few and far between, and the more they are triggered, the lower your chances of getting that spot to trigger again.  While this is good because you have fewer random battles than a normal RPG, it would've been easier to level-raise if the game featured just regular old random battles that trigger every few steps or so.  Other than that, the gameplay is mostly positive.  I really enjoy how you can return to previous locations to level-raise or get items (can't leave the final area at the end of the game, unfortunately).  I also like the fact that they kept the survival-horror feel of having limited inventory space but also gave you a convenient place you can store extra items (in the Weapons Department of the Police Station).  Overall, I think the game designers did a very good job of combining the best elements of survival-horror and RPG gameplay.\n\nOverall (score 9\/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  If you're a fan of RPG's and always wanted to play a survival-horror game but really hate the gameplay element of the latter, then Parasite Eve is for you!  It's really quite sad that Parasite Eve is the only game I've found that successfully pulls off this blending of genres; I really wish there were some more (Parasite Eve 2, unfortunately, was quite awful).  I strongly urge you to add this game to your collection; you won't be disappointed!","summary":"Aya Kicks Butt!","unixReviewTime":1231200000,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Parasite Eve is one of those rare jewels that has a female to fill in the main role and is a good game. Not only is Aya the hero but she isn't some tiny girl whose boobs are so big it looks like she stuffs them full of basketballs. She's a realistic looking girl (she still is quite a looker) who can keep up with the big boys. OK enough with that the actual game is sweet! The setting takes place in present day and still is completely realistic. Yeah I know what you people are thinking it's not realistic look at the PSX graphics!!!! I gotta admit this early PSX game doesn't hold it's own graphics wise anymore but with an awesome plot and a good battle system it just kicks, simply kicks. Aya is a police officer who ends up being our only hope. Even the military can't stand up against the enemy who fights on a genetic level. The game's plot goes all the way to Eve (Eve is really a woman they found in Africa everyone in the world is related too, seriously look it up on a search engine) and connects to the genes we all have. The idea that our mitochondria are against us is just ridiculous but this game pulls it off and is still extremely realistic. The game's selling point is the awesome plot that is simply genius! Before there was Silent Hill and the creepy atmosphere it created there was Parasite Eve, this game had a creepiness of it's own but (most likely because of Silent Hill and resident evil) it isn't known for it's creepy side. Hell Aya is a sexy gun toting girl next door, you got a killer crazy woman, the police, hell, the government can't lay a finger on, and an awesome plot and battle system...

As far as I am aware it seems that this game is a sequel of sorts to that novel, and alothough I do not believe the novel has been translated to English there is a movie based upon it that has been released state side by ADV films. The film is subtitled and not very good but does help to add more depth to the \"universe\" of Parasite Eve.\n I won't write much about the story, it is sufficent to say that the story is the driving force of this game which is a lot of fun, but like with other \"experimental games\" not without its flaws.\n The first flaw that this game has is that is controls seem a bit un responsive, and Aya moves very stifly. This game could have benifited from the motion capture techneques that were later used on Final Fantasy VIII. The next flaw is that the random encounters simmer down and eventually stop. You can \"wip out\" all enimes in a particular area making it hard to level up to riduculous levels of speed an power. Random encounters are a pain as it is, but if you're going to have them let me have enough of them to get up to level 99 and wipe the floor with the end guy.\n However the weapon mods are interesting, the overall gamplay is very innovative and over all this game was great.

In fact it was pretty good. I don;t think it was a 5 star game but it was definitely a good game.\nYou are the trick-fighter pilot Star Fox and you are accompanied by a Frog and a Rabbit (sorry the names aren't coming back to me) and with their help, you destory evil enemies and their warships in an attempt to bring peace back to the galaxy.\nO.k. first off the game play was very easy to get used to. All you had to do was aim, shoot, dodge and occasionally, pull off the barrel roll shooting which was fun to do. Anyone could get this game and get good at it and for a lot of people, that's a great part about a game.\nOne of the things that I truly didn't like about Star Fox was that is was a 1P only game. Honestly, why give you a couple of guys that help you through out the game if you can't have a couple of your friends come over and take control of those characters. I think if this would have been a multi link game, a lot more people (than already established) would have been all over this game.\nThe other thing that bothered the pants off me was that your 2 buddies never help you when you need them. I was getting grilled by a dozen enemies and all those 2 could do was hang out and watch me get beat up. Again, what's the point of having extra characters to help you when they don't do anything to help you. All they did (at least when I played) was get beat up and I'd have to save them everytime but whenever I'd have someone on my tail... \"oh watch out Fox\".

In typical Sega fashion, this game breaks new ground and leads the RPG genre into a risky, and very different direction. First warning: If you like to level up until you have godlike powers, and then storm through the level, look elsewhere. You start off in each dungeon at level 1, and can carry only a few items with you when you enter. What I feel is the hardest part about getting into Timestalkers is the break from the old \"level-up\" stratum that the RPG genre seems to be bound to at the hip. There is no, I repeat NO level gains between dungeons. All level ups are done in the dungeon, and once you beat the boss, you are back to level one again. However, you do increase as your class increases, allowing you to have more abilities and skills, which do follow you from dungeon to dungeon. The graphics are quite colorful, and are a pleasant break away from the Squaresoft style, which has permeated virtually every RPG on the face of the planet.  The music is downright strange, but if anything, interesting enough to keep me listening to it. Combat is an interesting matter. You are placed on a grid with your opponents and engage in turn-based combat. The only real difference that separates this from the traditional RPG is the ability to move along these grid squares in combat, which can affect your various skills and strengths. As though Pokemon has spread a virus throughout the world, yes, monster collecting is in the game, and yes, you can use them in combat to either help you or battle your opponents.

I became very interested in games that like and Descent that liked to mix things up in the first person perspective. Moving on I became fond of King's Field II because the game had a degree to darkness to it through both soundtrack(some parts sound like string synthesizers used in older horror films).Not to mention the sound effects had a very dimensional feel and lent more moodiness to the gaming experience. Good use of color and the monsters were creative with a good variety. However there is the reality of Shadow Tower...\n\n*I love how this game aims right for a vast dungeon atmosphere throughout the entire game. Lots of high points walking those windy stone paths that just dangle over a bottomless pit.,,you're not just going around grey hallways. Lots of creativity put into this game.\n\n*excellent monster variety all around in weapons,spells,armor,and monsters...just like King's Field. Plenty to traps you'll encounter too,after all this is a dungeon-like setting.\n\n*A little bit faster framerate versus the older KF games,not much but it wasn't designed to be running down the halls blasting a shotgun at hordes of enemies game like Doom. This style of game is more about up close and personal combat.\n\n*There's plenty of atmosphere captivated in Shadow Tower but no music score was a disappoint...I was hoping for something cinematic or flavored in the vein of king's field II.\n\nBeyond that it was fourteen bucks,long gameplay time,and a lot of fun.

I honestly believe that this man is capable of making some of the absolute greatest stories and games of all time. Unfortunately, it seems that with every game of his that I've played, I have enjoyed either the story or the gameplay much more than the other aspect in question. For Xenogears, I found myself very intrigued by the story. At the same time the gameplay, while fun at times, definitely felt dated and slow to me. This has to be a personal feeling though, because so many other people on the internet and elsewhere find the gameplay to be some of the best in an rpg to this day. Don't get me wrong though, the battles can actually be really fun, especially when you get to create deathblow chain combos. Despite my qualms about the game feeling slow and clunky, I still have to hand it to Takahashi for creating easily the most ambitious Science Fiction story that I have ever experienced in a jrpg. For this fact alone, I could easily recommend Xenogears to anyone who wants to experience a jrpg with a very interesting and captivating story. In the end, I would highly recommend Xenogears for anyone looking for a great story or even if you are simply a fan of Takahashi's later work.\n\nPros:\n-The story is very deep and interesting and keeps you playing the game even if the gameplay turns you off.\n-The characters are very well done, and you will likely get attached to some of them.\n-The music, composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, is amazing as per usual with his work.\n-Mecha combat, while painful at times, looks really badass.\n-The ambition of the game as a whole really shows, and it's great.\n-Deathblows (button combos in combat on foot) are actually really fun to mess around with.\n\nCons:\n-The gameplay as a whole (at least to me) feels dated and slow, especially in gear dungeons.\n-The dungeons themselves can get quite tedious, and several of them can take hours to dredge through.\n-The encounter rate in certain areas can get annoyingly high, but not enough to make you ragequit.\n-When walking around in an area with encounters, there seems to be a lag between when an encounter is programmed to occur and when it actually starts. You WILL notice this, and at times (especially when you are about to enter\/exit an area) it probably will annoy you.\n\nMixed:\n-There seems to be a slight preference by the creators towards gear battles. Depending on how much you like battling in gears, this could either be good, bad, or not an issue at all.\n-There is some religious symbolism in this game, and while it does not specifically target any religion, someone who is (or isn't) religious could be offended by it depending on how they view fictitious depictions of religion.\n-There is some nudity (both pixelated and in cutscenes) but you don't see too much. It still could be a bad thing if you're strongly against nudity in any form though.","summary":"Tetsuya Takahashi's first creation is like no other.","unixReviewTime":1376265600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

We have a winner. This game was a very ambitious project origionally launched by Square soft. Lets jump into the world that is Xenogears.\n\nGraphics-\n\nThe graphics were done very well for the time this came out. The anime cut scenes compliment the in-game graphics. It isn't seemless but it isn't as obnoxious or distracting as it is when done in other titles. The 3D rotating map was distracting, hard to follow and made me want to throw up at points. sometimes you are exploring an area in human size. sometimes you are on a large overhead map  but you can board and exit your \"Gear\" robot. In areas where you can pilot your gear, I don't recommend exiting unless you want to be stepped on.\n\nThe Story-\n\nThe story in this game is the thing people still talk about to this day. This game addresses and sometimes spoofs Politics, Philosophy, Religion, Economics, Consumerism, Aliens, Ufo's and large stuffed animals. It was as if the programmers borrowed from every point of media that they have ever enjoyed and stuffed it into the \"story\". For large robot stuff they borrow from the Guyver, Neon Evengeleon, Gundam ( all of them ), Voltron and bunch of other cartoons I can't even remember right now. The RPG elements borrow from almost every video game ever. The main story and character arcs you will recognize from a multitude of sci fi tv shows and films. Off the top of my head, I was reminded of the Twilight Zone, Outer Limits and Soylent green. Some of the que's they borrow from anime scenes might have people ready to cry plagerism. If you don't get out much or watch too many things, then the story will probably captivate and enthrall your attention.\n\nGame Play-\n\nThe other place this game shines is in the gameply department. The game uses an \"Active Time Battle\" system. The enemies don't wait for you to act and if you aren't careful, you get hurt in a hurry. You get these \"AP Points\" to determine the strenght or combination of attacks. Differant buttons have differant point AP point values. Entering specific button combo's will activate specific super attacks. You can save your points up to unload with a super finisher combo. Instead of magic, you get \"Ether Points\" for magic attacks. Your Ether stuff is the usual attack\/buff\/heal RPG fair. Fighting in your \"Gear\" is the same. Some Gears have different special attacks that use Ether that are only available to certain characters. These are weak and it's typically better to use your physical attacks instead unless you're fighting one of those magic damage only monsters. Also, you can store your points in hopes of going into Hyper-mode.\n\nThe Bottom Line-\n\nThis game has alot of things going for it. Xenogears was released in a time when Square fans had begun to feel alienated and even insulted by its later offerings. After the Final Fantasy series became dead to me, Xenogears was a refreshing breath of life. It was a very ambitious title that I don't even think the developers were able to complete. Disk 1 was a non stop rolercoaster ride. Disk 2 was a lazy, \"remember when that happened\" retrospective with a grandfather clock ticking in the background as you sit on a rocking chair and jump from one scene to the next via flash backs. Its like if young Steven Speilberg directed disk 1 and disk 2 was directed by old man George Lucas. It gets alot lazier but the programmers had a deadline to make. This is one of the greatist games I will never play again. I enjoyed it. It was resonably deep but Xenogears is a pilgrimadge I will only be making once. Play this if you consider yourself a hardcore Square\/RPG gamer.","summary":"the greatest game I will never play again","unixReviewTime":1332201600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

These games fade into history with little thought or attention. Then there are games like Xenogears which fall into another category: classics. A type of game that people will still be playing for years to come. Legions of fans exist for games like Xenogears that keep interest alive and well in internet forums and chat rooms and even Amazon review pages. So after 10 years I decided to revisit Xenogears, the classic PS1 RPG.\n\nThe most striking thing about Xenogears is how well the game has withstood the test of time. For being over 10 years old the graphics are still competent and actually quite good. The CG sequences show Squaresoft's flair for jaw-dropping sequences. A chill ran up my spine reading the introduction to the game: \"I am the Alpha and the Omega\", \"The beginning and the end\". Truly epic words that mark the beginning of an epic game. The game itself is a composite of sprite based characters and polygon based backgrounds. Everything is colorful and well rendered considering the age of the source material. The biggest feat in my opinion is that the environments are completely 3D, you can freely rotate the camera for a better perspective. Contrast that with Final Fantasy titles that features mainly static environments and cameras.\n\nThe storyline is as complex and mature as Square games get. You'll start with the main chracter Fei Wong, who lives in a small village and remembers nothing of his past short of small flashbacks. What unfolds is a world changing storyline that's a cross between A Brave New World and the Christian Bible. A game like Xenogears makes you wonder whether what you know as fact is really just that. I don't want to spoil anything by going too much deeper so I'll stop there but anyone interested in a deep story will absolutely love Xenogears.\n\nGameplay is centered around traditional Japanese RPG turn-based mechanics. Though your characters control more like a fighting game than a RPG. Characters can execute combos that require inputs of button presses. The combos are initially hidden and the more you fight the more combos you can unlock for each character. Magic is of course present in the game and the various characters have their own specialty, whether attack magic or healing. By far one of the coolest features is the extensive use of 'Gears' in the game. Gears are in essence giant walking mechs a la Mechwarrior. Gears are combat multipliers that make absolutely devastating attacks. Throughout the game characters will use gears at an increasing rate and the gears play a central role in the title.\n\nThe in game musical score is in my opinion one of the best of any Squaresoft game including the heralded Final Fantasy series. The musical tracks can at times be haunting when a particularly poignant scene is taking place or riveting when in the midst of combat.\n\nSo why then only 4-stars for Xenogears? Well there are a few problems with the game. First, Xenogears features various platforming sections throughout the game. None of these sections control very well and can be frustrating when repeated missing jumps and having to trudge your way back only to miss the jump again - all while constantly battling off enemies. Second, Xenogears is a 2-disc game though the entire contents of the 2nd disc feel rushed. It's almost like Squaresoft rushed the development process along of Xenogears halfway through. You'll go from playing the game and experiencing the set pieces first hand to reading about battles and story elements via in-game dialogue. It's a dramatic turn in the game that isn't wholly welcome. This shift doesn't ruin the game but it's disappointing because of what could have been had the game been fully developed.\n\nAs of this writing Xenogears has not yet made it to the PlayStation Network Store. Though hopefully that will change soon so more players can have access to this incredible game!","summary":"Retro Review: Xenogears is a Classic","unixReviewTime":1274918400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Unlike Final Fantasy VII which has just as much naysayers as it as fanatics, Xenogears is one of those kind of games where any attempt to label it less than a masterpiece is met with \"you just didn't get it\" or \"you don't know good videogames then\". So allow me to be one of the few that will say the game is in the \"gray area\": it's a good, even great game but it's just shy from the awesomeness everyone says it is.\n\nStory: Fei lives in Lahan, a quiet pastoral-like village. One night, massive robots called Gears(similar to Evangelion's EVA's) land and Fei jumps in an unoccupied Gear to fight them off. Something is awakened however inside him and he unleashes, which doesn't bode well for his village. Shunned by the villagers, he leaves and finds himself in a massive plot with serious religious overtones.\n\nGraphics: It's the Playstation so it does look a bit outdated. However the graphics at times are nice to look at during the cities\/locations. The overworld looks awful while battles look pretty decent, especially the Gear battles. The only problem is the camera sometimes. It's 3D so you can rotate the camera but sometimes the camera won't go higher or lower so sometimes it's pretty much guesswork how high something is.\n\nSound\/Music: Funny how both opposites these are. First off, the VA during the anime cutscenes are fine but the lip-sync is even worse than old kung fu movie dubs. The music however is excellent and you should definately track down the soundtrack.\n\nGameplay: The battle system is slightly different than that \"tap X\" stuff but not by much. You get 3 moves, Weak, Mid and Strong. Weak takes 1 AP, Mid 2 and Strong takes 3. You have a certain limit of AP that you can use. However, you can decide to \"save\" it and add it to a meter. Save up enough and you can unleash one Deathblow move after another. The only problem is that I couldn't find any indication on what your Deathblow moves were. It's pretty much trial and error trying to figure out what the combos are, or simply research on the internet. I went through a good 5 hours before I realized how to get a Deathblow cause there was no way of knowing what they were, let alone how to get one.\n\nThe Gear battles are somewhat the same, except each move costs Fuel and you have a preset limit. You can Charge to replenish your Fuel or you can Booster which costs Fuel but your attacking is better. Your Deathblows as a human are important because they carry over to your Gears as well. And they're quite important too. One early battle in my gear I was doing all my best attacks against one boss and I didn't know how to heal Gears yet so he completely beat me before he even got close to dying. Learning deathblows, I quickly beat him afterwards.\n\nHow's the story? Well it's well-written sure with a lot of religious references and elements. However, the game's so serious that the characters in a way feel like ways to advance the plot without being fleshed out. Also what I call the teaser happens too often. That's the \"wait, this happened, could it be he's...?\" parts and you find out 2 hours later what that is. Questions upon questions get piled up leaving you quite confused until later.\n\nIt's certainly a recommendable game, it's just not one of those \"best RPG ever\" ones, it's merely one of their better ones.","summary":"It's not the best ever but it's sure worth a play","unixReviewTime":1152835200,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

The storyline has often been touted as the best plot an RPG ever had, and while that can be debated (I always thought Chrono Trigger had the best storyline...), it's still awesome. A futuristic tale of social class warfare with various different symbolisms... very complex. I was a bit disturbed at the game's athiest point of view, but oh well. I'll let that slide. The battle system is also quite good, featuring several different combos your characters and gears can perform. The music is top notch, and since it's the same composer of Chrono Trigger (Yasunori Mitsuda), you can expect a gold musical score here. The multiplayer feature is quite good, too, and I shun all those people who have beaten me by using Xenogears (the ultim---er, CHEATING gear *Cough Cough* Someone I know.... *Cough Cough*).\n\nTHE BAD\n\nThe unfortunate downside of this game happens to be in the presentation. This game is virtually 70% dialogue and story and 30% gameplay. I'm not kidding. I came here to play a GAME, not WATCH it! I guess the RPG fans just want to sit there in awe, but when a battle is going on, I EXPECT TO PARTICIPATE IN IT. I was vastly disappointed when it cut to one of the characters in a chair talking about the battle with the pendant in the background swaying back and forth. This happened a lot on the second disc and it's a shame. I also felt the love story, albeit far from bad, didn't quite get the boost that it needed; it just seemed to \"happen.\" Oh well.\n\nOVERALL\n\nDie hard RPG fans no doubt love this game and while it's far from terrible, I do think it's overrated. A great story with interesting characters, but not nearly enough gameplay involvement. If I wanted to watch something, I'll watch a DVD. Nevertheless, I do recommend this game to any RPG fan, BUT ONLY TO THOSE WITH A LOT OF PATIENCE.

Xenogears is a pure RPG classic.  However, I only recommend this to those who are in love with the RPG genre and also whom don't mind to read for long periods of time.  This brought a great gaming experience, but some times frustrating.  Often the mazes the characters were forced to find their way through brought on a lot of aggravation when there were a lot of random encounters.  By the time the battle was through one could almost have forgotten where they came from.\nThe Pros: Excellent story with strong, believable characters.\n  Beautifully done animated cutscenes with voice-overs\n  Fun battle system with learned combos and magic.\n  Quite a lengthy game, (took me 63 hours to complete)\n  A gorgeous musical score, (get the soundtrack too!)\nThe Cons: Often times frustrating areas to explore.\n  Graphics can be quite pixilated\n  The battle sounds are quite repetitive\nOverall, Xenogears is one of those hidden, \"treasures\" in my oppinion. However, if you are not an avid RPG player, young into the genre, and lack patience for lots of reading, Xenogears may not be the game for you.  Though the game is hard to find, (which may change, since it may soon become a Greatest Hit) Although if you can't wait, and believe your game collection is not complete with out it, (which is what I believe), run and get it now, it is worth a great cost.

People always review games and movies saying \"This is the best ever!\"  Well, I will not hesitate to say that this is the third best game i've ever played.  In rank: Tied for first place is Final Fantasy 7 and ICO, third place is Xeno.  FF7 and Ico are just far to supurb to rank lower but to different in styles to say which is better.  Xeno follows up so closely... here's the Lowdown.\nGenre: RPG, Sci-fi.  Mecha styled with Anime as it's foundation for themes and artstyle.\nGraphics: PSOne level, entry level graphics.  Uses 3d environments for moving around in with 360 view.  Characters and such are depicted with 2D sprites with many many frames.  3 member party follows behind main player.\nRPG\/Square Elements: ATB.  3 member battle party.  4 euipment, 1 weapon 3 accessories (same for Gear).  Support and Elemental Magic.  Save Points.  XP, EP(MP).  CG and Anime cutscenes.\nBattle System:  The battle system is unique (one would think that this game was a beta test for Chrono Cross.  There are two combat modes, walking or Gear.  Walking of course is person to person fighting (sprite graphics).  You have several options but what drives the entire walking combat system are death blows.  At the beginning of the turn you have a full attack bar, anywhere from 3 to 7 points can be spent.  Three attacks Easy, medium and heavy cost 1, 2, and 3 points respectively.  After a certain combination is inputed, the character will execute a deathblow, given that it is learned.  This is a major part of the walking combat system.  If you do not spend these points in the attack bar, they go to an AP meter.  After enough AP is acquired if can be spent for a chain of death blows.  AP resets after the battle.  The gear combat is similar except only one attack can be made.  After every attack the characters gains an Attack Level up to 3 levels.  At any level ther can be a combo pulled off for more damage that will reset the Attack level.  Now Gear combat is also driven with fuel and it is used for every action except an ether attack (magic).  Items help to add do the damage, quickness and other stats.  DeathBlower items add the deadliest combos to the gear battles.  Booster mode spends more fuel but hightens speed.\n--\nA very neat thing that Square did with this game was to make the HP's of the gears and the players relative.  Players have a 999HP max while gears have a 99,999 HP max.  While palyers level up with XP, gears only level up with parts.  There is no part on a gear that makes it 99,999 though (scene once in a storyline battle).  A character may cuase 200 poins of damage to a gear, usually a killing blow to many walking enemies, but a mere scratch to the gear.\nSquare really tried to make a great game here, and they have.  I believe they made a great game... but that's becuase i can see its potential and really judge RPG's more from a storyline basis and a character basis than anything else.  What really happened here?  Square made a game that exceeded the PSOne's capabilities.  Simple.  What happened then?  Square sacrificed so many things to make the game playable on the PS1 and thus almost ruined it.  It lacks so many things that we now find standard.  The controls are easy to get but there is no customization menu... no text speed control, just options for sound (Mono, stereo, wide stereo).  The menu is easy to maneuver and the Save Menu allows you to copy games and delete games, even Non-Xeno games, which is a plus.  What else... well they sacrificed the cutscenes too... for the legnth of the game they kept the wonderful Anime to only the most important scenes... and the CG only covers what seems to be just what is most cool looking.  I found many moments when i was yelling at it saying \"And you didn't Animate that scene?  God, that was one of the most important scenes.\"  After having beaten the game i can see that the truly vital scenes are what is animated.\nThere is a neat little battleling between gears.  It's tekken like... kinda.  Not really.  It has 2 attack buttons, a jump, ether missile, dash and block.  It's a neat little minigame that will let you acquire two of the greatest items in the game... DeathBlower 3 and the GNSR(summ'n-or-other)50 which increases the Gear attack by 50%.  The strength of your gear does not effect the gears performance in the battle arena though.\nWhat really bothered me was the text storyline sequence in the second disk...  Just about all the second disk is key battle to key battle.  I would assume that this was to save room in the story, maybe it would have been too long any other way, but it just seems less fun... more movie-ish-like in the second disk.\nAnd about that storyline... it's really good.  I liked it.  But the way it is expalined and handed to you is so confusing... even when they go to explain it to you, you're confused.  I'm pretty quick and got it, but boy my roommate mind boggled.  It's kinda good in a way... gives you a reason to play it a second time.\nIt is essentially a good game.  But it seems that it could have had more to it... though it was long i would have liked to see the rest of it first hand instead of through the words of the characters invovled.  It is really twisted plot that holds many mysteries and ultimately will make sense.  But just as you think you understand you really don't.  I would highly recommend this game to those with patience.  Power gamers would like this game too.  I would also highly recommend this game to Square's Re-release board... for a remake, adding more to it now with up to 7 times more space on the PS2 dvd... and better graphics... such and such.  It is a good game.  Has a little anime blood in it, but nothing really big.  A common violence package that Final fantasy games are used to seeing.  Has a religious context, but really isn't.\nIf you know Chrono Trigger, Lucca makes a Cameo appearance.\nHappy Gaming.","summary":"One of the best Squaresoft ideas, but they missed it.","unixReviewTime":1024444800,"vote":"6","style":null,"image":null}

This game's not boring like \"Battle Ship\": it works completely.\n\nFor 2-player mode, you need ONLY ONE copy of this game because it already comes with two discs for you and your competitor.  You need two TVs, two PlayStation console units, and two joysticks of any style.  Unlike many other PlayStation game titles, you need no memory card to set up a quick competition between you and your friend.  However, you also need one link cable to play in its great 2-player mode.  Because of this requirement, the model of your two PlayStations must have serial ports.\n\nSome models of the PlayStation do not have serial ports.  Sony excluded serial ports from later PlayStation models like the \"Dual Shock\" and \"PSOne\" editions, because games rarely used those ports.  Furthering the infrequency, the games using the ports by link cable allowing two people to play together with two TVs and two consoles via this link cable connection meant having two on-hand copies of a game.  Since most PlayStation owners usually do not have the co-incidence of owning the same game titles as their friends, I imagine hardly anyone thought of buying a link cable.  Thanks to the developing software studio and distributor, \"Retaliation\" already includes the required two discs for playing the game in conjuction with a link cable.\n\nTo use \"Retaliation\" in 2-player mode, simply connect two consoles with Sony's link cable via the serial bus ports.  Plug each console into separate TVs, but face the TVs away from each other, so each player can keep his tactics secret from the other person.  Then, put each game disc into each console and start them.  Enter the \"Link Game\" section: this is the section where two players with linked consoles can play a skirmish game.  Then, start them.\n\n\"Command and Conquer: Red Alert Retaliation\" is great fun for two buddies, and it has over a hundred \"Skirmish\" maps to play.  Its previous edition, \"Command and Conquer: Red Alert\" has less than 20 \"Skirmish\" maps, so shoot for the \"Retaliation\" title.\n\nYou and your friend can play a \"Link Game\" cooperatively against two computer players, or the two of you can play every man (or computer player) for himself (itself.)  If you do not wish to play with a friend, you can always play the \"Skirmish\" mode against up to three computer opponents.\n\nYou do not need a link cable to play a \"Skirmish\" against only computer opponents.  However, if you have the linked set-up and your friend does not want to play, he can instead observe your match against computer players using the non-player console, the map unshrouded.","summary":"Two-Player Fun","unixReviewTime":1155600000,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

This is in many respects an excellent game!  I am a big fan of the regular Dragon Warrior series, and one of the big features of that series were the well-conceived battles.  They aren't quite as interesting in DWM, because there is a maximum of 3 foes at any one time, allowing for less complexity.  However, there are many compensating features--the monster breeding, the tournament levels, and, particularly, the random dungeon layouts.  And the game does not end at the end--far from it!  Far off in the distance is the possibility of defeating the master trainer, and farther still the possibility of collecting all the monsters.\n\nAnd it is in that last area, alas, where the game's fatal flaw resides.  The final monster is generated by a complex, multi-generational breeding process.  And two of his many ancestors that cannot be bred can be found only in a couple of dungeons that can be accessed only by winning, on three diferent occasions, five consecutive games of rock-paper scissors against other characters.  Think of it--that means you would have to try an average of 729 times before doing this!  And to add insult to injury, you have to suffer having the instructions read to you each and every one of those 729 times!  A true masterpiece of playtesting stupidity.  However, there's enough else in the game to warrant 4 stars.

Due to copyright issues, i wasn't successful. After having played Dragon Warrior Monsters 2: Tara's Adventures, I desperately wanted this game. I managed to get a used version, and as of now have put a total of 55 hours into the game. This game is a very long game. It's not hard, but a majority of the time spent in this game is for training. The goal of this game is to rescue your sister Milayou who was kidnapped by Warabou some stupid looking monster. In order to save you sister, you must get and train an army of monsters and win all the classes especially the S class to enter the tournament where if you win, you get to make a wish (which is obviously to save your sister).

However you don't have to re-play this game, you could just either train or compete again in anything.

This game is far different than Dragon Warriors of the past, because now in this game, you are a lone adventurer, who can find, capture and tame up to 3 monsters at once to fight for him (like Pokemon). You can get 100s of more monsters, but you can only have 3 in your party at a time, the rest must sit \"on the bench.\" You can train your monsters by walking around the world, fighting monsters, fighting in competitions of 3 battles or fighting other trainers who wander around like yourself. The sheer depth of this game is amazing, because when you capture monsters, tame them and raise where they will have unique skills, then you pair off mature male and female monsters to have a \"wedding\" and create a baby monster with all of the skills as the parents. That is pretty much the plot, unfortunately the world which you must roam around to train your monsters is not really a world, its more like a random maze. Literally random, each time you enter the world, its different.

Naturally, when I found out this game existed, I rented it and had way too much fun with it, though it wouldn't be until 1998 where I would buy a copy of this game at the nearest used videogame shop.  As I got older, I decided to check out some other Ren and Stimpy games I initially missed out on, such as Fire Dogs and Buckaroo$, and I can safely conclude that of all the games based off this gross, surreal cartoon, Stimpy's Invention is the best out there.\n\n STORY\n\n The story for this game is that Stimpy makes a machine called the Mutate-O-Matic, which transforms garbage into food.  However, when Stimpy turns it on, it malfunctions and explodes.  Ren and Stimpy have to adventure to find all the parts, put the machine back together, and turn it off.\n\n GAMEPLAY\n\n Stimpy's Invention is a platformer with some combat thrown in.\n\n You can control either Ren or Stimpy, and easily switch between the two just by pausing the game and toggling between them.  Ren and Stimpy have their own individual attacks, such as Ren striking enemies with a fly swatter and Stimpy using a towel.  However, to master the levels, you'll have to use attacks and moves that utilize both characters.  To make long jumps, when controlling Ren, you can squeeze Stimpy to make him fart, which propels the both of you really high into the air.  With Stimpy, you can spin Ren's head and use him as a helicopter.  There's even combo attacks, where Ren can make Stimpy hurl hairballs at enemies, and Stimpy uses Ren as a boomerang.  While Ren and Stimpy are essentially equal in terms of combat and movement abilities, I preferred controlling Ren since he was my favorite character.  However, in one level where you have to fly around a bird sanctuary by farting, I always switched to Stimpy because even though both characters had an unlimited amount of farts in this level, it just seemed more \"right\" to me by controlling Stimpy through the farting level.  The combat and maneuvers perfectly match the gross and surreal nature of the cartoon.\n\n If you fall into a bottomless pit and still have life in your lifebar, Powdered Toast Man will jump in and save you.  However, if you exhaust all your life when you fall, you'll die.\n\n You can collect items like money bags and spit-jars for points, but if you find jars of Powdered Toast, it'll recover some of your health.\n\n The levels are designed quite well and show enough diversity.  You venture through the neighborhood, the kitchen, refrigerator, the zoo, the city, dog pound, the woods, and even a surrealist scientific laboratory.  Aside from the usual platforming and combat, there's a level where you fly around through farting in the air and in the end of the \"city\" level, you have to ride a bike through a dangerous street where the Dog Catcher is trying to harm you, along with Mr. Horse taking up space on the road and inadvertently bumping into you if you're not careful.\n\n MULTIPLAYER\n\n There's even a multiplayer option for the game, where you can get another player to control another character on one screen.\n\n ART DIRECTION\n\n The art direction in this game is done really well.  If you're a fan of the Ren and Stimpy show, you'll be glad to know that BlueSky Software matched the art direction of the game almost perfectly to that of the cartoon.  Most of the levels are shaped after settings in the cartoon, especially with the dog pound.\n\n The combatants are very faithful to the show's characters, since enemies are shaped after characters like the Space Cabbage (from the episode \"Marooned\"), the Kodiak Marmoset (from \"The Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen\"), the deranged Fireman (from many episodes, but most notable in \"Fire Dogs\"), and wrestling brothers Lump and Loaf (from \"Mad Dog Hoek\").\n\n SOUNDTRACK\n\n Sam Powell's music for the game matches the spirit and tone of the cartoon very well.  Even with the 16-bit limitations of the Sega Genesis, the music and sound effects make this an unmistakeable Ren and Stimpy piece of media.\n\n COMPLAINTS\n\n My only real complaints with this game is that it's a little too easy and too short.  You can beat this game in about 25-30 minutes without much trouble.\n\n FINAL WORD\n\nSadly, Ren and Stimpy:  Stimpy's Invention hasn't been reissued in recent years, so if you want to play it, you'll have to track down a Sega Genesis copy of the game. If you're not a fan of Ren and Stimpy, you may find it to be an average game.  However, if you're a fan of Ren and Stimpy, this will be a pretty big slab of platforming fun.","summary":"A game based off a cartoon that's actually good.  80%","unixReviewTime":1355961600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Sure, the first level's pretty ugly, but the explosions and action are great.\n\nI managed to find a copy of the game roughly a year ago, and I feel that it was well worth it - and that the long wait didn't really hurt the game too much. Apocalypse sports some impressive visuals, with great (but short) FMV sequences, and even working video screens within levels (similar to those in Aliens vs. Predator) - always amazing on the ol' grey box.\n\nOne quibble is with the apocalyptic United States deal, the rather unbelievable enemies, and the many lines Bruce Willis yells at an invisible partner - the game was originally a bit bigger in scope and had Willis as your partner, rather than as the player character - but I only found this as a reason to pay closer attention to the proceedings, since the development history of a game always fascinates me.\n\nMoving on, the game's other sin are the jumping segments. Some are fine, but others are terrible - and you're saddled with one of the worst early in the game, where you need to dodge falling rocks while moving along platforms in a cave. The first time I played through that it must've taken me at least half an hour to get through it. Today I managed it after losing somewhere around five lives, but the game over wasn't welcome.\n\nStick with it, though, and you'll be rewarded with some cool fights and levels (my favorite so far is the city).\n\nI don't disagree with the other reviewers about the graphics and sound, although once again the first level looks pretty terrible by today's standards (I think it gets a bit better later on), but this is forgivable. Bruce himself looks awesome and moves well, especially with the analog sticks (if you have analog joysticks on your controller, they're a must - especially for aiming shots when sniping enemies with the submachine gun type weapon).\n\nHe sounds good, too, with a (small, but awesome) variety of snappy quotes. Sure, some are rips, but they get the job done and I often still find myself chuckling about them. I've always been confused by the quote in the GameSpot review above; perhaps the reviewer was guilty of the classic error of turning the machine on once to get an impression. Sounds may echo depending on your location; get into an open area (like the City) and you'll notice that the sound effects (including the voice) are very clear. The only voice clips I don't really care for are the police clips in said city level - the humor's a bit mean-spirited but unimaginative, they've been tweaked to sound very odd...basically, they suck. But hey, the rest of the sound effects are good, and POE's soundtracks definitely add to the game as well.\n\nAgain, the game controls beautifully if you have dual analog sticks. I played the game for roughly an hour using the d-pad and face buttons and really wish I hadn't, but when I switched to the sticks it felt great. It's a bit hard to aim precisely with it (which will be a problem mainly when sniping), so you'll need to wave your firing point around a bit. That said, the game works perfectly when it drops you into the middle of close quarters battle, and at times I can't help but feel that this simple, pure gameplay is among the most enjoyable on the PlayStation.","summary":"Strap one on, it's time to jam!","unixReviewTime":1158019200,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

And just when Capcom ran out of ideas, they established the Mega Man X series for the SNES: a darker and edgier take on Mega Man that won over the fans instantly. So it was a big surprise when Capcom announced they would release Mega Man 7 on the SNES and in 1995, they did just that. The classic Mega Man series marched forward onto the SNES and while it doesn't bring anything new, game-play wise, it's still fun to blast robots and take on Dr. Wily again.\n\nMega Man 7 takes place right after Mega Man 6. While Dr. Wily was locked up, his secretly programmed robots activate and wreck havoc on the city and eventually break him out of prison. Mega Man is back on the beat determined to catch and put Dr. Wily back behind bars. After completing an intro stage, you choose from one of 4 stages. Once you explore them and defeat the Robot Masters, you get access to their weapons and use them on other robots. After going through the mid point stage, 4 more stages open up. Ultimately you reach Dr. Wily's castle and finally face off against him. You'll come across numerous power ups and even have the chance to buy them at the shop with metal bolts (the game's currency.) After each Robot Master's stage is complete, you get a password to use later on as there is no battery backed save feature available.\n\nThe PROS: It's exactly what you would imagine of an NES Mega Man game updated with 16-bit graphics and sounds. It looks, plays and sounds good. You will feel right at home except now you use a SNES controller instead of the one for the NES. Capcom did try to add new things like buying power-ups and collecting letter plates to gain access to your canine pal Rush's other useful functions. While using the password system is a bit cumbersome, it's still better than having to start from scratch when you turned off the game.\n\nThe CONS: As fun as this game is, it brings nothing new to the whole concept gamers has come to expect. A lot of elements and past influences from the previous NES titles are sprinkled throughout the game so if it feels like you played through these stages before, that's because you have. Some of the Robot Masters are truly unique (Turbo Man, Spring Man and Slash Man) while the rest use similar themes already covered from the previous NES titles. This game is also not as hard as the others but beware when the difficulty level sharply rises from Dr. Wily's castle stages up until you fight him as he is next to impossible to beat.\n\nMega Man 7's release was met with a lot of mixed reactions and sharp criticism because it was compared to the Mega Man X series. Due to poor opinion and a limited amount of copies available at the time, it didn't sell as well as other SNES titles. Later on, we would find out that the developers had little time to make it and it makes me wonder what else they could have done if it wasn't rushed out the door. But for what it's worth, it's a good game and an excellent addition for Mega Mans fans to have in their game collection. Good luck finding a copy so if you decide to give it a try, you might be better off getting the Mega Man Anniversary Collection, which has Mega Man 1 through 7 and extra goodies.","summary":"Classic Mega Man series marched onto the SNES","unixReviewTime":1314230400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71LVh2jfGvL._SY88.jpg"]}

You can choose to play as either the Americans or \"szie Germanz\" (the latter seems to be the most fun). The game sets itself apart from other alternatives in the genre (such as STARCRAFT and COMMAND & CONQUER) by focusing on realism. In BATTLE OF THE BULGE you order troops around and not single individuals (as is the case in real war), and your units won't necessarily do everything you tell them to if their morale falls too low (they might for instance decide that it's a better idea to retreat and find cover if they suddenly find themselves under heavy enemy fire). And it's no good sending infantry troops up against a heavy armoured tank division. The best strategy to deploy seems to be using your infantry units to spot the enemy (since they have a better visual range than your armoured vehicles) and then keep the tanks close by for protection.\nThe graphics of the game are good enough (explosions and smoke grenades look especially nice). But it can quite often become a painstaking job spotting yours and the enemy's units on the map (and your units don't always fire at will). The sound mixing is good. Whenever you finish off an American tank, you'll hear a satisfied German declare that the enemy is neutralized (and the Americans will be shouting \"bailing out!\"). Much fun. But if you're fresh to the series (like I was) you should be prepared spending a few hours getting used to the gameplay. So if you're after quick action this game might not be the pick for you. But if you're into strategy games with historical and realistic elements, then this game should be just right for you.","summary":"Good game with just a few setbacks","unixReviewTime":991958400,"vote":"2","style":{"Edition:":" Standard"},"image":null}

But once I got my hands on it, I immediately noticed some weak areas. Being a Close combat series Hard Core Fan, I had already bought  all the previous three titles, and found some plus and minuses, especially  if compared with \"The russian front\" (CC3).  MINUSES Units: Your  battle groups have fixed types of units, meaning you cannot adjust your  forces from defence to offence posture (those shermans seem to be useless  in defence against german armor). In the end it gets very boring to play in  the same map with the same units over and over again!  In CC3 every battle  is different, since you can adjust your forces each time. The detail  offered in CC3 is also more specific going down to the single soldier  level. This used to be useful both during battles and during the plannig  phase, where you coluld notice that a particular soldier or unit had been  with you for even a few years. In the end I found a tendency not to use the  older units because I feared they colud get killed!  BATTLES: Strategic  overview means you will be playing over some maps over and over again,  having to go thru a complete cycle before you can move your forces again.  AI: THE AI IS MUCH MORE STUPID THAN IN CC3. I played the first time on the  german side, and won every single battle. It does not like to move very  much, even if winning.  PLUSES Graphics: Better and more ralistic. Air  & arty support: You now can call in support during the game. It gives  some more flexibility, but not enough to have a real impact on the game.  Strategic level: You now have a strategic level where you can move your  battle groups around befor playing single battles. This feature adds depth  to the game, but sometimes prevents flexible movement. One unit per square  is too few, and makes transiting battle groups thru controlled maps  impossible. You first have to move out any unit that is controlling the  area, reconquer it with the new unit and then you can move to the offence.  A pain if you are in the rear areas, a nightmare if you are moving on the  front lines. This feature looks like something out of an AMIGA 500 strategy  game.  MY SUGGESTION: If you are a CC series fan, BUY IT, since it gives  you a completely new battlefield to play on. If you never played a CC  series game before, BUY CC3, a much better game overall.","summary":"Good game, but I liked CC3 better","unixReviewTime":952905600,"vote":"35","style":{"Edition:":" Standard"},"image":null}

After i played it i answered that question with two words Oh yeah! This game is the best action game there is and it's large enough, and challenging enough to keep you going for a while. I was playing this game for quite some time (a month and a half to be exact) before i got all the alternate routes figured out. It would've been shorter if work didn't intercede with my gaming time but i have to pay for my bills somehow right. The story involves two brothers, one being the veteran and the other being the rookie take a guess on which you'll be playing. Anyway you start off the game by wiping out the terroists that have taken the statue of libery. Now here's where this game sets it apart from most shooters. There are multiple ways to complete an objective either you can go in and kill everyone in the area or you can sneak by them and knock them out. I usually choose the second approach since it's more of a challenge that way rather than just start blowing things up, which gets old real fast. Once you complete your objectives you get a set number of experiance points which you can give to certain abilities such as sniping (my favorite) or other attributes like hacking or electronic bypassing. This gives the game maximum replayablity with all the choices you can make in the game, if you foul up a mission you continue on, you just change the attitudes of some characters you meet later. The only problem i have with this game is it has a slow start, but once you get past the first couple of misions it's a breeze the rest of the way, with a great story that twists and turns with every step you take, it's great gaming defintly a must have for any hardcore gamer.","summary":"great story,action, and characters.","unixReviewTime":987120000,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

I bought the game based on the other reviews here, and I have to  say, they're right on target.\nDeus Ex really delivers serious gaming fun.  It's like a game with an X-Files-esque plot (without the aliens), Rogue  Spear gaming (strategic FPS), and Soldier of Fortune(action-oriented FPS).  It really delivers and gives the player the opportunity to take a  balls-out, guns blazing approach or a more stealthy, sneaky method to get  what you need done (either way, you get just as much skill points, so  you're not penalized for not getting a maximum body count).\nThe graphics  are great. Nothing particularly revolutionary (as with Vampire) but  definitely nothing to complain about. Generally very smooth with lots of  detail, nice lighting, good atmosphere (you really don't see this on a lot  of the screenshots). The plasma gun really has a nice effect, as do the  grenades, but when things blow up (like crates) it's just a bunch of  polygons (yawn). I guess we can't expect all games to have the detail (and  gore) of Soldier of Fortune.\nThere are a few holes in the plot (such as  it's feasibility), but with a little willful suspension of disbelief, it's  rather engrossing. (I've had more than my fair share of 5+\/hour playing  sessions with this puppy.) Travelling from New York to Hong Kong to Nevada,  you'll see plenty of places and meet enough interesting characters to keep  you going. I don't know if different responses to conversations give you  significant variances in the plot, but it's interesting all the  same--especially the different ways you can solve your missions.\nI've  become very picky in terms of the games I buy, I don't have a lot of time  to play them and I don't have a lot of money to spend on them, so they've  got to be good. This is one of those games I am delighted to have bought  and -certainly- recommend to others.\nThe only reason this didn't get  five stars is because of the unplausible premise in the plot and the lack  of anything really ground-breaking in the realm of gaming (though, I'll  admit, this is one of the best games I've ever seen at really having the  feel of an authentic RPG.)","summary":"A real gem, must buy","unixReviewTime":964396800,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Haughn","reviewText":"Final Fantasy VIII defintely has the look and feel of a true Final Fantasy title.  The game plays well and tells a great story.  It is worth the purchase for the PC version even though the graphics were not upgraded from the Playstation version.  I was personally happy when the game came to PC - I don't buy game consoles anymore.\n\nFF8 is not the best Final Fantasy title out there.  In my opinion, FF7 is the best, with FF6 and FF4 (3 and 2 in the U.S., respectively) tying each other for second.  Then FF5 (not released in the U.S.), then good ol' FF8.  (That's my list and I'm stickin' to it.)\n\nI am going to assume that you are reading this review as an avid RPG gamer or a diehard Final Fantasy fan.  With that assumption, I will leave out all the great details of the game since, as I said before, FF8 is a true Final Fantasy title.  Therefore, you know it rocks.  But I'd like to focus on the drawbacks if I may be so bold, and explain why it ranks below the Super Nintendo versions and its PC predecessor.  All in my humble opinion, of course.\n\nFirst, the magic system for FF8 is the greatest drawback in my opinion.  It removed the idea of magic points (MP).  In the old titles, if you had 350 MP, and you used a Cure 2 spell, it would decrement to 325\/350.  You'd have to replenish eventually or simply run out.  In FF8, however, the magic you use depends on two factors: (1) you have to \"Draw\" the spell out of enemies (the amount you draw determines how many times you can use the spell), and (2) the strength of the magic you use is determined by the amount you drew (up to 100 effectiveness\/capacity).\n\nIf that all sounds confusing to you, it is.  It still doesn't make any sense to me, and I think it almost killed a great game.  But Squaresoft is reknowned for altering each release with something totally different.  Too bad the magic system in FF8 was such a flop.\n\nSecond, the funnest part of the other titles, I thought, was the coordination of items (like weapons and relics) to progressing skills.  (Which FF7 nailed perfectly.)  FF8 only allows a milder version of this coordination.  Character development isn't such a focus in FF8, I think.\n\nLastly, to be quite honest, the most fun part about the entire game of FF8 for me was the card playing - not the actual game itself or the storyline.  In fact, exploring the FF8 was actually dull for me!  (I was surprised to learn this, too!)  But when I found places to play that wonderful little numbered card game, I found myself spending hours doing just that.  I was hoping Squaresoft offered a side version of the card game that I could trade FF8 in for.\n\nThe card game for FF8 was supposed to be like the Chocobo development offered in FF7.  However, like I said, the card game turned out to be the best part of FF8.\n\nTo give some slight pros, I would say that the creatures with which you do battle were rendered quite nicely in FF8.  I also appreciate a lot of the bosses (especially the Twins).  The graphics are also good enough for the RPG genre - I don't complain about that stuff when playing RPGs.\n\nTo close, if you never bought FF8 and stuck with only FF7 and your Nintendo titles, you'd be alright, in my opinion.  But if you want it all, FF8 is not a total waste.","summary":"A True FF Title, But Not As Legendary","unixReviewTime":1156896000,"vote":"6","style":null,"image":null}

The game has excellent graphics and movies and support for all video cards, but I liked the gameplay in FF7 better.  What I got most hooked on in the game was the mini-card game.  Its very fun and you can get items for obtaining certain cards.\nLike in FF7, FF8 has an excellent storyline in which Squaresoft does best anyways.  The Junction Battle System didn't appeal to me as much though.  There are Guardian Forces you must collect in the game and you must junction to one to get even the most basic commands.  Furthermore, you must find rare items and magazines to get upgrades on your weapons.\nIt is also the wierdest FF game i've played.  Usually in RPGs you get a whole bunch of experience for defeating a boss.  In this game, you get no exp for bosses or certain enemies.  Also, money is salary based in this game.  You won't get a single penny from the wandering monsters.\nAll in all, another smash hit FF RPG!!!","summary":"Another FF smash...","unixReviewTime":987897600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

It's fun, fast, exciting, and it has good music. (This may seem trivial, but it will become quite important.) When I learned about Mario Party 2, I was obviously excited. The mini-games all seemed cool and the new board games seem fun.\nWell, January comes, and I get it on the first day. Overall, this game is very good. The concept hasn't changed from the first one 11 months earlier. Whoever has played either Mario Party or Mario Party 2 should know this already, whoever hasn't, I'll explain it.\nThe Mario Party series is basically an electronic board game. First, you break open a box Mario style to determine turn order. This game is separated into 20, 35, or 50 turns. Each turn is made up of when one person \"rolls the dice\" by breaking open a box. A number appears and the person goes that many spaces. You can land on many spaces. A blue space gives you 3 coins (6 in last 5 turns) and a red space takes away 3 coins (6 in last 5 turns). You can also land on a Bowser space, where Bowser comes and causes havoc, a chance game, or a question mark space, where a specific even occurs depending on which board you're playing on. After all 4 players go, a mini-games starts. It can be either 4 players, 3 vs 1, or 2 vs 2.\nThe boards in Mario Party 2 is actually quite fun, and most minigames are nice. Some, like Torpedo Targets, Honeycomb Havoc, Skateboard Scamper, Abandon Ship, A Day at the Races, and the duel games, are annoying.\nThen why 4 stars? Many reasons. The mini-game coaster is frustratingly frustrating on the hard setting. It took me hours to pass it. And the music. Oh, the music. The music, as I said, is one of the best parts in Mario Party. The music in Mario Party 2 is different, and not for the better. Some of the tempos gets on my nerves and it's just, well, not Mario.\nBut overall this is a good game.","summary":"Good Game, but it's not quite like the first one.","unixReviewTime":976579200,"vote":"3","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

The graphics are still sub-par, but I guess you'll have to overlook that if you wish to play. My favorite board in the game is probably Western Land and my favorite mini-game is Honeycomb Havoc.

In the case of Nintendo 64, they've had very few real sequel success stories with their video games. In the case of Mario Party, they've made a couple of very decent sequels to the popular game itself. Two of them made it to the Nintendo 64, the other is on the Gamecube.\nMario Party 2 came out less than a year after the smash hit the Nintendo 64 game screens. The game picks off a little bit from the previous version, with the same six characters to choose from, but the games are a bit different than before. Most of the games are absolutely new to the system, including Cake Factory, Look Away, and Roll Call. There are also another few twists that are here that weren't in the previous game. One of those twists is that there is item games, to collect items like Boo Bell, to call Boo the ghost, to collect coins or stars from opponents, and the dueling glove. This item you use, you can challenge one opponent to a duel, where you bet your coins for a win. There are six in general, depending on the course your on. Although the games on Mario Party 2 are a little bit harder to control,  it takes a little more time to get used to, especially in some games where the controls are extremely sensitive. Nevertheless, it is just as challenging.\nAlthough many places stopped carrying Nintendo 64 games, it is a little bit harder to get games like these. You either are lucky and you find them newly conditioned or used, or you go on a wild goose chase to get a certain kind of game you like. In this case, if you're a fan of the previous Mario Party for Nintendo 64, I suggest you give this one a roll of the dice too.","summary":"A Decent Sequel","unixReviewTime":1048204800,"vote":"2","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

I still feel that the graphics are excellent. Gameplay is pretty good. One thing that lacks here is the fact that you almost have to do a one-timer to score. Scoring on a breakaway is next to impossible. I do feel that the away goalie has the advantage, as another reviewer wrote. The ref seems to always be in the way. I wish you could check him into the boards!! Line changes are a challenge. Bringing up the lines is easy. But then you lose control of your players until you have selected the lines. Also the line box covers about 1\/4th of the screen. So you must do the changes very strategictly. Movement of the players is excellent. There is no lag form stick to screen.  One thing that keeps me from giving this game five stars is the \"extras\" as I call them. They don not give out the trophies at the end out the season. Where are the injuries? When I slam Mike Madano into the boards about ten times at full speed, he should get some sort of injury. And last, there is no display to show your stats against the rest of the players in the league. You must scroll through each team to see who has done what. But the worst flaw is a tie. Either the repetitive commentary or non believeable saves made at times by the goalies. If you play enough, you will see and hear what I mean. Scoring is still sometimes easy(especially against Calgary and Nashville) and other times hard. I still say this game rocks. It is very fun to play. I will say that if you want a game to have years of fun with, buy it!! If you want a flawless game that is near perfect, go to the Pepsi Center and watch the Avalanche!!!","summary":"Reviewed Again","unixReviewTime":972259200,"vote":"10","style":null,"image":null}

Maybe it was, but that's not why I got it. This was one of the Dreamcast's launch titles back when it launched in ol' 99. I would have to say any Dreamcast fan should have this in their collection. It represents the time when console games were become identical if not superior to the arcade versions.\n\nIn the game you pick a taxi driver and zoom from one spot to the next picking up customers and taking them to a location within a time limit. It's definitely arcade quality as you'll probably only be spending a few minutes before time is up. This is also accompanied by a few select tracks from the Offspring band, something that was more recognizable back then and probably won't shine as much now. It gets old listening to the same songs so I would recommend to anyone looking to spend a lot of time with this game to pick up the Xbox Live or PSN versions as they probably have options to customize the soundtrack.

I got bored of it in around 10-12 minutes, But rather you are a casual gamer of not, this is a nice addition to your Dreamcast library, as it is one of the classics, and if you are very short on time, you can mess around inside of the game's two well-designed worlds.\nThis game also has quite a humorous side. Hearing the driver and the passenger shouting back and forth betwixt each other while your driving is an experience that's very laughable.\nAnother notable side to this game is the music. The songs are great, The Offspring rarely fails to impress me. However, there are only 4 songs in the game. After playing the game 20 or 30 minutes, you'll have the songs memorized, and then the game starts to feel a bit more repetitive.\nI myself think this game is worth buying for 15 dollars or less. If you can't find it that cheap on Dreamcast, it was ported to GameCube and PS2, and later to Xbox Live Arcade * I don't know if PSN has it*.

The only complaint I have with Crazy Taxi is the occasional slow-down in the game (Note the 4 star rating) But overall this Dreamcast title is a must-have offering good replayibility and just pure brain-less fun.","summary":"Lets Have Some Fun!","unixReviewTime":1038528000,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Now you can buy it new for half the price I paid. Figures. Oh, well. To start the review, I must mention that this is NOT a racing game. It's actually a mix between an action game and a driving simulation. But that's what makes the game so fun. Thanks to Sega, you can now take a job you would probably hate, and at the same time, have the time of your life. The object of the game, obviously by the title, is to pick up passengers and take them to their destinations on time. Sounds easy right? Well, not exactly. At the same time, you've got traffic with cars just waiting to get in your way, huge cities that are pretty easy to get lost in (assuming that you have the code to turn off the help arrows), and a fare clock that keeps ticking away no matter how much you beg it to stop. Leave it to Sega to take the most aggrivating job in the world, and make it seem like paradise.\nGraphically, there is a lot to like in this game. The cities are modeled beautifully, including pedestrians that jump from in front of your car just at the last second. The game also sports a smooth frame rate of 60 fps.(Except in certain parts when a ton of action is on the screen, then it drops drastically. But right afterward, it shoots back up to full speed.)\nThe sound is also top-notch, with music by The Offspring and Bad Religion. In my opinion, the song All I Want, by The Offspring, fits the tone of the game perfectly. The sound effects are cool as well, as customers yell at you to pick them up, and then complain that you're driving too slow. But sometimes their language gets out of hand. Sorta. Therefore, the game has a Teen rating.\nOverall, if you're looking for a game with loads of fast-paced action and excitement, and also one that lets you be a real-world cabbie, without having to break your bank, then you needn't look much further than Crazy Taxi. It's one of the wildest rides you'll ever take.","summary":"Great racing game! (But is it really racing?)","unixReviewTime":1011139200,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

But of course the game has some, well.... alot of flaws.  The game was designed from the very popalare aracde game called, \"Crazy Taxi.\"(Of course)  The game does feature this aracade verison along with a new verison for dreamcast.  The game clevery mixed in humor, a some what different type of gameplay, and of course good plain fun.  Before I go into the basics I must clear up something, this is not a racing game.\nI'll start with the gameplay.  In Crazy Taxi you must pick-up persons and bring them to different areas.(Like the airport)  This is were the fun factor comes in.  There is 2 courses and a mini game area called crazy box.  The game also has 4 different drives, each with there own car and strenghts.  I must say Crazy Taxi does hold impressive gameplay.\nNext is the sound and the graphics.  The graphics are good, they are very smooth, clean, ect.  Yes, there is a small flaw in the graphics, a very unstable framerate.  In very dense areas of the game it feels like time stops, cause' of how slow it gets.  The sound is crisp, lots of different voice samples.  But in the sound comes another flaw, it's the soundtrack.  The soundtrack features; offspring and bad reiligon. This wouldn't be a problem if they had a bigger selection, there's only like four songs of the game.(This is the biggest drawback)\nOverall the game is worth ten bucks.

Great controls, 2 huge San-Francisco type cities with lots of traffic, and some fast-paced taxi-driving action make this a must-have title for Dreamcast.\nThe main point of the game is to zip around in one of four choosable drivers and his\/her own taxi and pick up customers.  They'll tell you where they want to go and a handy little arrow will point in the direction.  The faster you get there, the more cash you rake in.  This really puts an emphasis on mastering moves like the Crazy Dash, a turbo move, and some spin moves that you can learn in the game to improve your times.  You can choose arcade mode, where the clock is always ticking but time increases as you get more customers, or play to a certain time limit.\nBut all this action, believe it or not, can get old in a couple of weeks.  If it weren't for the mini-games in the game that are so fun and challenging, it would probably get old in a couple of days unless you have a friend to challenge on who gets more cash.  But still, for ten bucks, you can't go wrong with picking this up.

Although the Dreamcast team is now making games for other systems they have had a few gems with their own system and this is one of them. If you played this game in the arcade, it's pretty much the same thing except that now Sega has thrown in a new, larger city to pick up passengers, along with a new Crazy Box mode which enables you to perfect your Crazy Taxi Moves. This game definitely has more than that of the arcade version and has good control. The only bad thing about this game is that if you were good at the original arcade version, this wouldn't be much of a challenge. Also, there is no two player mode in this game, and if there was it probably would have been better. If you play with a friend you can only take turns trying to beat each other's scores. Also, after playing the game for a while you get this repetitive feeling, especially with the music and the setup of the city.

The city is nicely detailed, the animation is smooth and the overall look is bright and crisp.  The sound is good but a little repetitive (the same songs from Offspring and Bad Religion repeat over and over again).  Similarly, the characters seems to have a very limited vocabulary.\nThe biggest problem with the game is it's lack of depth.

{"overall":4,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"01 12, 2001","reviewerID":"A3VYDLL7WN5ZCM","asin":"B0000488VP","reviewerName":"SnowedUnder","reviewText":"This game originally appeared in arcades and it was popular enough for Sega to decide to release it on the Dreamcast. It's a good thing they did, as this is a brilliant game. The basic idea is to drive the streets of San Fransisco as a taxi driver (there are four 'crazy' characters to choose from each with their own car and driving style) and earn as much money as possible by picking up customers and performing 'crazy' moves to impress your passengers, who will then give you a 'crazy' tip (yes, the game does tend to overuse the word 'crazy'). The more moves you can pull off in succession (combos), the bigger the tips you customers will give you. There are two huge areas to drive around in this home version, with no limits on where you can go and how you get there. One of the courses is the same as the one featured in the arcade version, but there is another course that's exclusive to the Dreamcast, and it is just as good as the original. The courses are both very varied and interesting, and there are always new shortcuts to find and things to discover. For each course there are 4 options; drive for 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes or play by arcade rules, where the time limit starts at about a minute and counts down until it runs out, but you get time added on for each customer you pick up. In all modes the customers you pick up will have a countdown above their head, and you must get them to their required destination before the time runs out or they'll jump out without paying. Get them there really quickly and they'll reward you with a hefty time bonus. There are many different characters hanging around the city waiting to be picked up, and thankfully you seem to have the monopoly on the taxi business in San Fransisco! The main goal is to earn an S-class license by earning over $5,000 in the arcade time mode, and this is extrememly tough! You can crank the difficulty level up or down by changing all the settings including traffic density, initial time limit etc., but if, like me, you consider that cheating, you'll stick with the regular settings and persevere until you finally get there. If you want to really beat the game you should aim to reach #1 on the record rankings, which means you'll have to get about $8,000 - that's no easy task!\nThere is another Dremacast-exclusive mode called the 'crazy box' mode, and this is definitely one of the best apsects of the game. Basically it consists of 16 unique minigames (with more to unlock). For each section you are given an objective and you must complete it within a given time. Each one is hellishly frustrating (in a fun way), and you will find yourself staying up way too late trying to perfect knocking all 70 pins down in 30 seconds in crazy taxi ten-pin bowling. Completing each one is difficult enough, but completing them in a fast enough time to beat all of the pre-set records will destroy any remains of a personal life you may have. It's tough!\nThe game benefits from having licensed real locations, such as Kentucky Fried Chicken and the Original Levi's Store all with real building styles and logos - it just helps to make it feel real.\nThe graphics are excellent. The designers obviously didn't strive for gritty realism, but that's OK. The game's slightly cartoonish, colorful, over-the-top graphics work very well and give it a refreshing look. I have a MAJOR problem with the occasional lapses in frame-rate and draw-in, however. Every now and then you will be driving along and the game will slow to a near halt, and it will stop for a second while the Dreamcast wheezes like an asthmatic rhino with a throat infection. And if that wasn't bad enough, the background music will skip, then the CD has to reset and start the song again from the beginning, and during this the draw-in has receded to about 10 feet in front of your taxi so it looks like you're about to drive into an abyss of nothingness. OK, so maybe I'm exxagerating. But it IS a problem, and there's really no excuse for it. Most of the time everything runs fine, but maybe once every five or ten minutes the above scenario will happen. If, like me, you couldn't care less about it then it won't affect the fun of the game, but if that sort of thing bothers you then you probably should steer clear (pun half-intended) of this game.\nControl is excellent, the cars all handle very well. I have a Madcatz MC2 racing wheel and I tried it out, and although it worked nicely, the game is very heavy on the button-pressing combos, and I found it much more practical to use the standard controller. The game's physics are generally accurate, and collision detection is spot-on, which is a good thing since you will be involved in a lot of collisions.\nUnfortunately there is no online element of the game, nor a multiplayer one. It's a shame, because a multiplayer option would have been great fun. This is supposedly being rectified in Crazy Taxi 2, due for release some time in late 2001, so if you can't stand the thought of single-player-only gameplay then you might want to wait for that. The game does give you the option of challenging a friend in a way; the menu interface will remember records for up to 5 players on one Dreamcast, so you can take it in turns to beat each other's records and the game will keep track of who is better. The records section is excellent - you can sort records by name, track, mode, etc. It will even tell you the date you achieved each record and what taxi driver you were using at the time, and it can all be saved onto a memory card so you can carry on another time.\nThis probably isn't one for the kiddies, what with all the reckless driving and the rude customers, who have no problem with telling you if you are a lousy driver. The background music, which comes from bands like The Offspring and Bad Religion, can quickly get repetitive - I prefer to turn the music off and play my own CDs on my stereo. The characters you pick up can also get a little tedious, as they're always repeating themselves. Apparently there are a lot of identical twins\/triplets\/quituplets in San Fransisco, as I often found myself picking up identical-looking people within minutes.\nThere are some very nice touches in the game. Traffic is ultra-realistic, all the cars, buses, trucks and trams behave exactly as they would in real life (with the exception that they stop at stop signs and red lights and drive courteously...). If you cause a massive pile-up on the freeway, there will still be upturned cars there minutes later when you return, with the drivers wondering just what they did to deserve such a ... day. The game tells you how to pick up customers by showing a 'zone' around the person in which you must stop, then it will display an arrow indicating in which direction the customer's destination lies; when you are familiar with the courses you have the option of cranking up the realism by turning off zone markings and arrows, though this is for pros only!\nDespite its minor flaws, Crazy Taxi is a fantastic game that is superbly made. I can't wait for the sequel, but for now this will keep me occupied for most of my free time! Now it is available at a budget price, you would be a fool not to buy it. I give it a solid 4 out of 5; I would have given it 5 if it weren't for the minor annoyances that plague it. Overall, highly recommended: a must-have unless you really don't like racing\/action games. The huge fun factor redeems it from its shortcomings.","summary":"Another excellent game from Sega!","unixReviewTime":979257600,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

It's like a digital aquarium, really: Get the system stable and thriving and then ... watch it.\n\"Majesty,\" though, solves that problem. Sure, it's a sim, a medieval fantasy version of \"SimCity\" by way of \"Dungeons & Dragons.\" In addition to creating rogues guilds, dwarven settlements, blacksmithies and the like, \"Majesty\" is based around \"epic quest\" scenarios wherein you're challenged to defeat some evil facing the land, send your heroes on a quest for some fabled artifact, rescue a hostage taken by villains and so on.\nJust as in \"SimCity,\" you don't control your wizards, warriors, rogues, elves, dwarves, gnomes, thieves and so on. Instead, you have to do what any good monarch does in a fantasy game: Put prices on monsters' heads and offer rewards for heroes willing to explore unknown (and almost certainly hostile) territory.\n\"Majesty\" is a hoot, and a massive timesink: You'll lose whole nights and weekends to it without realizing it, and love every minute of trying to squeeze a bit more service out of heroes who'd rather laze about the inn than go study new spells or visit an elven hut-of-ill-repute than go fight the troll heading for the kingdom's market.\nThe 19 epic quests included with on the disk are fun, and a 20th is available from on the official Web site. (It serves as a preview for the forthcoming expansion disk.) But while there's a large jump from the beginner to advanced quests and then another more moderate jump from advanced to expert quests, they ultimately don't prove too challenging overall. Expect to finish most of the quests with a week or two of nightly play (less if you've got more time to devote to the game). There is a mode where the game randomizes new quests, but it's along fairly simple lines and the random quests don't have the same appeal as the premade ones. And once you're done with the quests ... well, it turns into \"SimCity\" again.\nHopefully more quests will be added to the Web site for download or the expansion disk can finally be released. (It will add more building types, more monsters and a dozen more quests.)\nAn excellent game for sim fans who, like me, want a bit more direction and focus to their gaming experience. While it's worth the price -- it really is a unique and entertaining game -- it's not one you're likely to spend playing for months and months to come.","summary":"Terrific game, if a touch too easy.","unixReviewTime":978912000,"vote":"12","style":null,"image":null}

That's not to say that this game doesn't have its share of problems, but overall, I liked more about it than I disliked so I'd have to say that it's a winner.\n Some of the shortcomings of the game are the monsters.  Contrary to what the back of the game says, there doesn't seem to be much of a variety of monsters, more of a slight redefinition of them.  Also, the scare factor isn't very high in the game, going for a couple of the shock type scares, but not having an overall creepy atmosphere.  Also, some of the voice actors are annoying, particularly in the fact that the main character only has about a dozen spoken lines in the entire game and merely makes noises for the rest of the game.\n On the plus side, the weapons, although there aren't a lot of them, are very straightforward and easy to use.  Plus, two of them have unlimited ammunition so you don't constantly have to be on the lookout for more bullets to survive.  Also, the health items are fairly abundant, plus the game has a unique feature in which you can hunt and kill animals for meat, which also heals you.\n Also, the cut scenes are quite numerous, although some of them are quite confusing until you've progressed further into the game.  Sometimes I felt that there were a few too many cut scenes, but they do help to drive the story and keep you immersed in the story.\n The ending of the game is a bit confusing in my opinion and could have used a bit more clarification.  I'd like to see a sequel to this game to find out what happens next, but unfortunately, with the Dreamcast on the dead list, it won't happen on this system.

Unfortunately, it is somewhat underappreciated, like most Game Boy Color games.  And the graphics are somewhat crude, but it doesn't detract from the game at all.\nIn this game, you automatically start out with Pikachu, instead of choosing between Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle, and your rival gets Eevee.  The game plays out exactly like Red and Blue, except for a few things, such as Jessie and James showing up a few times.  (Unfortunately, they only show up a limited number of times, which is a bit of a letdown if you ask me.)  And the Pokemon have been redesigned to look more like they do on the TV show.\n\nHere are the pros and cons of this game.\n\nPros:\n\nPikachu says its name instead of making a sneezing noise.  I really liked this, even though the voice clips aren't of particularly good quality.  (Some find this annoying, but I don't.)  Also, Pikachu follows you around instead of staying in its Pokeball, and you can see what kind of mood it's in if you turn around to face it and press \"A\".\nAs you get to know Pikachu, it will get to like you more and more.  (I've been playing my current game for an estimated three or four years now, and Pikachu now has little hearts flying around his head.)  However, it gets ticked off with you if you put it in the PC or let it faint.\n\nYou can get Bulbasaur, Charmander AND Squirtle--at different points in the game.\n\nThere's a mini-game in this game called \"Pikachu's Beach\".  If you have a Pikachu that knows Surf, you can play it.  Unfortunately, you can only teach Pikachu Surf through a complicated method involving Pokemon Stadium and the Transfer Pak.  Or, if you prefer, you can use a cheating device.  (I do NOT recommend the latter, however, because cheating devices can mess up things on your game.)\n\nCons:\n\nYou can't play as a girl.\n\nIt's really hard defeating Brock (the first gym leader), because Pikachu has a glaring weakness against Rock and Ground-type Pokemon.\n\nThis is just a personal thing, but I really don't like the plot involving Lavender Tower (having to go and calm the ghost of a dead Marowak).  Of course, no Pokemon actually die in the game (if defeated in battle, they just faint), but this part of the game is still rather unsettling.  It also might bother some younger or more sensitive players.\n\nThe item pack is really hard to navigate through (it's hard to find things in there).  Fortunately, this is improved in Gold\/Silver\/Crystal.\n\nSome parts of the game are really ridiculously hard--but, really, that holds true for almost all video games.\n\nYou can't battle trainers over again, except for the Elite Four, so it becomes hard to level up your Pokemon after awhile.  And after you capture Mewtwo, there really isn't very much more to do in the game, except try to get all 151 Pokemon.  Fortunately, all of this is improved in Pokemon Gold\/Silver\/Crystal.\n\nIn conclusion, Pokemon Yellow is awfully good, even if it's \"out of print\", like so many other Game Boy Color games that shouldn't be.  But if you'd prefer better graphics, then I'd recommend Pokemon Crystal.","summary":"I Choose You! Pikachu! :3","unixReviewTime":1139270400,"vote":"7","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

It's easy to get into and the tutorial is pretty explanatory showing how to form your armies on the battlefield. but it's not just war, you have to manage your income to which is manage by rice or koku. then you can move your armis around the map and either negotiate or go to war with other nations. eventually you'll go to war with all of the surrounding nations and thats when you get to the battles. The battles are real time and are extremely remarkable. The layouts of the field are great from the mountains where you can position archers from to fire down at your enemies, or the forests where you can make a surprise attack. There are only two problems though and that's the control and the morality of your troops. You can have the largest army there is and still you end up falling back because of your generals rank. The control can be a pain sometimes especially if you're positioning your troops in diffeerent areas and they are facing the opposite way of the enemy.

But you forget that once you are launched into battle. The graphics are amazing - fully animated armies of thousands of soldiers that you can control over beautiful terrain. You'll need a high-spec PC though - I have a fairly hi-spec dual P3-733 \/ nVidia GeForce 2 system, and can get good performance at 1024x768 (I cant wait to take it to 1600).\nSome people have complained about the game shipping with a poor manual. According to the Shogun website, the US edition shipped with an abridged version of the manual. My copy (bought in the UK) came with a thick user manual, and two reference cards - which is just as good as any other game I've seen. If you want the full documentation, you can also download it from the [total war] website.\nThe manual doesnt discuss tactics in detail, and leaves it to you to discover the benefits of the various unit upgrades available. As with any other strategy game, you're best off looking in internet forums for this sort of info - if you want to shell out on the strategy guide you can too.\nThe best part of this game is easily the battle sequences. The music, graphics, and enemy AI produce not only the best wargame that I've ever played, but one of my favourite of all games. Once you see your Samurai swarming over the battlefield to chase some rival scum off the face of the earth, any criticisms of the game just seem irrelevant.\nSaying that, I do have a wishlist. There's no editor available yet, and the campaign game is pretty limited (theres not much you can do in the way of diplomacy). The unit types are all very alike too - you get samurai with bows.. samurai with spears... samurai on horses... and thats about it. Its certainly nowhere near Age Of Empires 2 in that respect.\nPro: Fantastic graphics. Great ambience when you're in battle mode. Lots of variety of tactics, terrain, and very realistic.\nCon: Needs a high spec machine. No editor available (yet).

Let me get my one complaint out of the way and agree with  the other reviewers.  The manual isn't very helpful.\nThat being said,  you don't need to buy the strategy guide to learn to play.  It did take me  a while to master the many facets of the game, but after a couple of false  starts and a little patience, this became one of my all time favorite  games.  It even inspired me to go back and read \"The Art of War,\"  and the \"Book of Five Rings\" which are excellent books even if  you have no interest in this game.\nThe realism is your friend and you  must learn to use the weather and terrain to your advantage or you will get  nowhere.  Also, be patient (an ongoing theme) and choose your battles  wisely.  Learn the teachings of Sun Tzu and do not raise an army twice.  Do  it once and get it right.\nThe Ninja element is one I especially love.  I  am a student of Taijutsu which is the fighting art of the Ninja, so I have  a fondness for the original \"men in black.\"  Proper use of Ninja  and Geisha can be decisive.  Learn how to raise their kills and take out  crucial generals and Diamyo for maximum results.  I managed to eleminate  several factions through assassination alone.\nYour impulse will probably  be to rush if you're used to playing games like Age of Empires and  Starcraft, but you're going to have to wait and ensure you have the upper  hand before attacking. This isn't the RTS you're used to, so don't be  frusterated when you don't conquer the interface in a day.\nThe music and  graphics of the game are excellent and the historical elements give it a  level of class that no other game can come close to.

One such case took place years ago, and it involved the game Shogo.\nShogo, a very polished FPS, is a game which takes itself much less seriously than others of its kind yet surpasses them in many ways. It integrates a great game engine, fun gameplay, different game modes and even slight RPG elements into its formula, making it a true winner.\nMonolith's game certainly does not lack style. Based on Anime cartoons, both level and character design are greatly hightened by the thematic choice. What we are left with is a game that at no point bores the player.\nShogo seems to really nail the genre it belongs to. While providing a (then) much needed change of style for an FPS, it did not lose playability in the process. Mortal Kombat-like blood and gore are spread all over in typical Anime fashion, and the maps are divided between slighlty strategic and full blown-action.\nThe use of the locations is quite bright, making you backtrack only to find reinforecements have been called, in a realistic manner. The gameplay is well balanced, and little details such as the speed of the human character's walk are just right.\nConsider this my vote for a sequel.","summary":"Best Kept Secret in Gaming","unixReviewTime":1021680000,"vote":"4","style":null,"image":null}

Set in the future it is a japanese anime inspired game. You play Sanjuro Makabe a soldier in the United corporate authority security force and against the terrorist leader Gabriel, he is in love with two girls both of them sisters and daughters of the general. The story is orginal and a certain situation you will be given an option of what to say. In the level \"city of hope\" you will be given an option of what to say, If you choose the first option you will get to play many levels in places much different from what you would play if you choose the second option. The game has two different endings. Shogo's gameplay is very good, part of it you play Sanjuro on foot and part of it he is riding an mca (giant robot), They are very well balanced, few levels on foot, then robot, then on foot, then robot ect ect, They make the game lot of fun and very intresting. There are many types of mca's for you to choose, very fast but a weak mca, very strong but slow mca ect. Shogo's gameplay is very good, There are lots of great action with lots of villans to fight. The enemy AI is bad, baddies do not react if you snip their partner standing nearby. This flaw makes shogo a little linear.\nShogo is powered by the lithtech engine. I played it on the Direct3D video mode and the game runs very well. The graphics are outdated today and the human charecter don't look real, but being an anime inspired game makes the graphics quite ok. There are loads of well designed and challenging levels. The level designing is fantastic and some of the levels are quite funny, In one level you need to jump from roof top to roof top in your mca and in one level you need to search for a pussy cat in a wearhouse so that it's owner would open the door which will let you into the next level. Shogo has a lot of really cool weapons and there are loads of different weapons for the human and the robot. Shogo's only flaw is the weak AI, besides that it is surely the best giant robot game ever made and a great fps.\nFinally I had a small problem with the game and almost everyone with Geforce based video cards may have that problem in Shogo and Blood2. The main menu will not appear or keep flickering. Turn the vsync to always off in the more Direct3D option or go to planetshogo.com, They have a solution for it.","summary":"Shogo: Mobile Armor Division","unixReviewTime":1014163200,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Its hard to play a game in a series without judging it against previous ones. When I first played NFS5 it had a very different feel to the previous  ones. The graphics engines on 3 and 4 were almost identical. 4 had lots  additions to 3, it was the introduction of the career mode, damage but it  did sometimes feel like an add on pack as it had the same 'feel' - similar  cars, same gameplay\/graphics.\nStill, after much debate I have found I  enjoyed the 4th installment the most because of the introduction of the new  career mode.\nSo what additions were there to #5. Does it feel like  another add on pack? It plays like a different game entirely. Gone are the  cops (sob!)and the range of cars and bring on the Porsches!  There are TONS  of them and everyone is different. It was a bit boring at first with the  old cars (as they drive like a wheelbarrow!) but once you get going this is  a hughly addictive game.\nMy favourite part is still career mode where  you start of in the 60s with old cars and build your way up to modern day.  Winning tournements means you get money to buy new cars and so on.\nThe  graphic engine has been totally revamped. Cars movement is more realistic  as is collisions. One bad hit will do your car a lot of damage unlike  before. Steering will suffer (similar to Rally Championship) and you won't  just get big knocks bumping up your damage the same as small knocks.  The  graphics are also the best of their kind. You need a good spec machine  (nothing less than a PII400) and although there always seems to be a lack  of tracks in NFS games they are a joy to ride. They have multiple routes  for the first time and the cars AI has been improved. I didn;t find myself  ALWAYS winning and you have the option to buy parts for you car which will  substancially make it quicker.  There are the usual modes of play aswell  as a Factory Driver mode where you have to complete tasks like drive in and  out of cones in a certain time etc. I didn't find myself playing this too  much.\nI miss the other cars, cops and wish there were more tracks (loses  a star for this) but this doesn't detract from an excellant racing game. I  still played NFS4 more when I first got it but this game is the bees knees.  Much different to the other titles and holds the crown of the best racing  graphics to date.

Well over a year old, this is still the most fun to play of all the racing sims.  At the time it came out, it strained older computer systems.  Now anyone with a recent computer should be able to play it (people with high-performance systems may want to reload this gem again and play it with all the settings maxed out - very nice!)\nAs many of the other reviewers have attested, the physics of the cars are so completely different that it's the first time I can say I feel like I really am driving different cars.  All the other games claim this, but they all felt the same to me.  It really is a challenge to master the handling, braking, and performance issues, especially in \"Evolution\" mode where you have to start with the older, slower, poorly handling porsches and work your way up to the later models by winning race after race.\nThe details have been juiced up so the damage reflects on your vehicles, right down to headlights getting knocked out.  The headlights \"twinkle\" during night driving and the sun gets in your eyes during the day.  You can customize the trim, colors, racing stripes, add a racing number, and even specify whether you want the top up or down on the convertibles.  Damage is still unrealistic (for obvious reasons - one plow into a retaining wall at 150mph and game over!)  Yes, Need For Speed fans, you can flip your porsches (we weren't able to in earlier versions.)  The replay camera angles are great and you can see yourself driving the cars.  The sound of the engines in each of the cars are distinctive and unique too.\nThe tracks are great - what I've seen at least.  They claim there's a total of 14 tracks, I don't think I've seen half of them yet.  Not sure how to unlock them or the certain cars they block us from playing.  Personally I don't want to have to race all the other cars just to unlock one particular model - they get one of the stars knocked off for this annoyance.  The computer AI is a little easier now in beginner mode.  It has to be cheating in the more advanced modes.\nI'm not sure of this (yet) but according to the EARacing website, multiplayer is going out the door and we may not have a multiplayer option unless we pay to join the fee-based Motor City Online servers, grrrr.  Racing's fun, but not for $10 a month in my opinion.  If this happens, this will be a real disappointment. EA advertises additional downloads off the Internet.  Turns out it's just 4 additional cars.  While that's nice (especially the 959!), it certainly isn't an elaborate expansion of the game that you might infer.  It would've been nice if they included some additional tracks too.\n\nEven if we're stuck with single-player mode it's still a real treat to play.  I hope EA considers making a \"Ferrari Unleashed\" or \"Lamborghini Unleashed\" in the near future.  If you're looking for a gift for a racing nut or leadfoot friend - this won't disappoint.

It is a very complicated game that can still be played simply and has a great \"learn as go\" set-up.

It's a huge hit in Germany, where there are contests for figuring out puzzles in game scenarios.\nThis is a sort of Civilization set in the olden times, 1602 of course, when galleons discovered new worlds and set out to create trade routes and garner wealth for aristocratic settlers. The game starts by settling an island (you are in a race with the computer, who tries to beat you to a choice bit of land. Some of the islands are lousy--too many volcanoes, for one thing, or lacking essential resources.)\nYou need to build up from wood-cutting plantations, to cotton and grain, up to the ability to mine, forge metals and eventually build some handy cannons and muskets to take out the pesky pirates. Did I mention pirates? Well, as you are shipping from island to island, running your important trade routes, these nasty guys pop up and take your stuff, not to mention try to sink your ship. Eventually, it's payback time and you'll deal with them.\nMeanwhile, it's all you can do to keep the locals happy (tip; don't forget to build a hospital. It's demoralizing to see a once-happy island decimated by the Plague.) Then the locals want more, more, more. Schools, churches, universities, even a palace and cathedral. And they like their booze and tabaccy, not to mention regular meals. If you starve the people, they won't forgive you. And you can lose.\nThis game has nice graphics, and is pleasing as either a single-player or multi-player game. It appeals to women as well as men because the military aspects are secondary to building and developing a new land. The only criticism is that the military function is boring. You clear your enemy islands the same way every game and it gets old. The play is straightforward and with a minimum of help from the manual, it's easy to get engrossed in game right away. You can adjust the speed to single for detail work or jump up to double speed for the boring bits. There are demos available online to download, including the new 1503 A.D., a new game, which has more complicated graphics, and enhanced \"everything\" --something to work up to when you get bored with 1602. 1602 AD is one of our favorite games of all times.","summary":"A great single player game, can be multi-player as well","unixReviewTime":1050537600,"vote":"10","style":null,"image":null}

You begin with a  number of islands on the map, and with your flotilla of boats, you explore  them, learning what each is good at producing. You settle on one, creating  hunting lodges, tobacco plantations, sugar cane, chapels, and homes.\nJust  as in the Caesar III style of games, there are steps to take to create  products. You take tobacco from the farm and turn it into cigars. Sugar  cane goes to the distillery and becomes alcohol, and the tavern buys it.  You can also establish trade routes. An island low in tobacco can ship that  in, and send off the stones it is mining.\nHomes develop in size as their  needs are met. Quarry stone for more advanced buildings, and build your  technology for more interesting options. Build up your sheep farm and send  wool to the weaver for more content (and well dressed)  inhabitants.\nThere's combat too - pirates lurk in the seas, and nearby  settlements compete with you for land. You can invade their territory, or  try to outmerchant them. You can even multi-play to take on your friends in  high seas adventure.\nWhile this is definitely fun for beginners, it  leaves something to be desired for advanced players. I would recommend this  to a family that wishes to play together, and for gamers new to strategy,  who want to learn at a gentle pace how to manage resources and grow a city.","summary":"Great intro for people new to strategy gaming","unixReviewTime":968025600,"vote":"26","style":null,"image":null}

The premise is quite interesting. You're a 34 year old senior female military person, working for the Crayven Corporation. The Order is your enemy, and you fight them.\nThat's about all you know as you begin the game. You fight them because you're told to by the cold manager, Enrica Hayes who has no brains and couldn't care why you do what you do. When you get your mission briefings from Enrica, you then get to configure your units with whatever options are available, fill your drop ships, and land to attack.\nThe game works with individuals grouped together into set units. While a set of 4 tanks move together, a particular tank can get wounded and die. You can't tell a particular tank to go somewhere on its own, though. The unit moves together. This makes it easier to manage many missions, simply grabbing units and pointing them in directions.\nThe graphics are great!  Ground Control has the move-anywhere view that Dark Reign 2 uses. Very intuitive and easy to use. Follow along with a unit, or get a birds-eye view of the great graphical combats. While my Athlon-750 often choked on some of the larger scale combats (boding poor results for slower machines), in general it whisked along at a good clip.\nThe landscape is fully three dimensional and fully rendered. Hide in the shadow of a cliff to get an ambush jump on your enemy. Sneak along under trees or overhangings to avoid being seen. Troops have options for weaponry and healing that can be customized. Troops can be carried in APCs to zip from location to location, and peel out quickly into whichever formation you specify.\nThe downsides on the game are the stuttering I mentioned before on heavy-graphic situations, and also the general situation you, Major Sarah Parker, find yourself in. While it's great that the lead player and her boss are both women, it's very, very annoying playing a game in which you watch your 'friends' shoot up hospitals, where you're berated by your commander and where no matter how quickly you get to someone, the program insists it's \"too late\" and you must watch the person die to further the plot. I have enough frustration in real life without playing a game in which the lead character is drinking after each mission, wondering why she even keeps fighting. Does that provide any incentive for the player to want to keep playing?\nAlso, most games of this style allow the player to choose amongst factions and decide which side to play. In this game it's very linear. Each mission is forced on you, and what you do in the mission is pre-set. While replaying the same mission 10 times might have them decide to attack from the NE or the SE randomly, they always attack, and then the same exact messages always appear, which you cannot click through.\nIf you enjoy strategy combat without building units or structures, and have a fast enough machine to handle this, Ground Control might be the perfect game for you!","summary":"Amazing graphics but your system has to handle it","unixReviewTime":970963200,"vote":"12","style":null,"image":null}

I can't help that but notice that this game could have been so much more.\nI never played the original MDK so I had no real idea of what to expect other than what was given on the box. So this is what I was given to expect. The ability to \"choose\" (This is the keyword here) between Max, Doc or Kurt. In reality, the game alternates between the three characters (in no seemingly specific order) through out the game. It isn't actually till much later in the game that you actually do chose between the three characters. But by then it's a tad to late and you simply want the game to be over. This, in all honesty, is the major killing point for this game. It seems useless to have three characters to play when playing them is not done by choice. yeah, yeah, I know about all of the good stuff the game has, all the stuff I mentioned above but still, Gamers today want more, a whole lot more.

The latest use of that very engine was Icewind Dale 2.  This package of the game is completly watered down, not including the thick manual that was supposed to come with it.  Also, the \"DVD style\" box, started by EA's Medal of Honor: Allied Assault makes for a skimpy package.  Those who have never played any Infinity Engine games will be completly confused at first, for the manual is on the CD.  It is much better to read a hard copy of a manual.  Interplay also does not replace Icewind Dale manuals.  However, the money that you spend will go to a full version of Icewind Dale, with no expansion.  Amazon offers a bundle of Icewind Dale and its expansion, Heart of Winter.  I do believe that it is called \"Icewind Dale: The Collection.\"  Heart of Winter is not really worth the money and cannot be found anywhere except in the packaged version with the stand-alone Icewind Dale, or at the Interplay-Store.\nTake note: Icewind Dale (IWD) is an extremely difficult game.  It is easy to say that it is an Action Based Baldur's Gate, lacking in story, but filled with combat.  This combat though is extremely hard.  People new to the Infinity Engine will find even the first Ogre Boss in the prologue to be difficult.  The first real boss, a topless snake woman named Yxunomei (spell?), is even more difficult.  Many a time, one will find himself losing more than half his party to just one monster.  Even with difficulty setting to \"Very easy\" it still is not such an easy game.  The pace is not as fast as say Diablo 2.  People new to AD&D, but veterans to games like Diablo 2 will find it strange that an attacking animation is shown, but the enemy is not hit.  Utter confusion.  Later in the game, there are creatures that must be phased before they can die and such.  Games based off the Infinity Engine are not \"click fests\" such as Diablo 2, but more with strategy.\nIcewind Dale is a good game, despite its punishing difficulty.  After a single gaming session, one will feel as if he (or her) has accomplished something.  If you are to get the first IWD, then get the expansion, Heart of Winter, bundled with it.  Heart of Winter offers a lot of features, which i think is valuable.  Item clutter does get a bit off hand if items such as a Gem bag are not included.  800x600 resolution is also nice.  There is also the feature to remove the interfacing with a single key stroke, keeping away those who talk, bashing the intrusive interface.\nHowever, if you are looking to a newer game, then I am sure that Icewind Dale 2 will satisfy your needs.  It is not necessary to play the first IWD to understand the second.  Every Icewind Dale game is extremely difficult.  Along with Baldur's Gate 1, Tales of Sword Coast, 2, and Throne of Bhaal, all Infinity Engine games are long and difficult.\nA final word to leave you with.  If you are afraid of difficult games that are long and can get tedious, but yet you want a game made from RPG masters?  My final suggestion: Neverwinter Nights.  It is no more than 60 hours for the single player and the difficulty is no where near any of the BG series or IWD series.  Plus, its not based off the Infinity Engine, but a modified 3D engine.\nMake your decision or buy them all!  (note if you do buy them all, expect to spend more than 1200 hours playing D&D CRPGs!)","summary":"AD&D?

Needless to say they'd sold out between running the ad (Sunday) and me getting there (Monday), so I shelled out the extra thirty bucks for Icewind Dale, since it was based on the same engine. Did I get my money's worth? You better believe it.\n The basic premise as about as tissue-thin and unnecessary as it usually is in AD&D-world games; you're new in town, the town elder is forming an expedition to help a neighboring town, you sign on, things go wrong, you have to save the day. Nothing at all new here. But who cares? The whole idea is to lose yourself in a party of characters who are capable of doing all sorts of things you're not, and along the way you get to pummel a bunch of nasty things that will otherwise have you for dinner.\n Back in the days when Pool of Radiance had just come out (I'm talking SSI gold box here, not Ruins of Myth Drannor!), I could never have imagined how great AD&D computer gaming would become.

The game also defaults to the \"easy\" (but not \"very easy\") skill level so that us non-veterans can actually play and get through the levels without being pounded mercilessly.  As a result, after a short learning curve, and discovering when to hang back a little from the action and when to charge in, you can enjoy this game without the $200 force-feedback joystick serious space\/flight-sim players probably purchase.\nOn the other hand, it's such a hoot, you might find yourself wanting to invest in some hardware.\nThe graphics are still wonderful, with huge battleships throwing massive particle beams at each other through lightning-charged nebulae and the pacing and mission difficulty curve is quite fair except for one spy mission which is rather harsh.

I beat it in under 6 hours my first (and only) time through.  From what I've heard and read, 5-10 hours is average.  In other words, don't expect the weeks of entertainment the packaging promises...\nSo, onto the basic premise of the game.  You're a young boy named Rion.  You wake up in a lab with no memories and an array of psychic abilities, apparently received while you were the unwilling subject for some sort of experimentation.  You begin the game by escaping your restraints and trying to win your freedom.  As you progress through the game's 4 areas, the story unfolds through character interactions and beautiful movies and images usually triggered by some sort of psychic flashback or intuition related to various objects and locations.\nThe gameplay basically involves battles (that are usually few and far between) and puzzle solving (mostly of the \"find items and keys and figure out where to use them\" variety).  Your main weapons in battle are your psychic abilities, enhanced by chemicals called PPECs.  You start out with 2 offensive abilities.  Nalcon allows you to send sort of an attack wave ...  You'll get a 3rd ability (albeit a fairly useless one) halfway through the game.  So, you're basically left with 2 fairly weak main attacks, each taking more than one hit at full power to take out all but the simplest of enemies.\nThe game's weapon and healing systems all rely on drugs.  You have certain amounts of offensive drugs in your system.  When they run low, you have to inject yourself with more.  When your health runs low, pop a pill.  You also have \"anger points\" that rise just from walking around and rise more rapidly when you use psychic powers.  This is due to the interaction of drugs in your system, and when the AP meter gets to high, you \"short\", which is basically a psychic overdose that leaves you walking around with a big migraine.  The plus side:  Every enemy you go near while shorting will die violently.  The negative side:  Your health will go south rather quickly until you stop the shorting by taking a pill called delmetor.\nEnemy battles are usually easy, except for a handful of very difficult end bosses that take a while to defeat and a few instances where enemies attack you 3 at a time, leaving you frustratingly unable to fight back.  Strategy is limited, usually involving running around in circles until you have enough time to charge your powers and attack.\nAs for the graphics and sound, they're both excellent for the Playstation.  The general game graphics are nice, sharp, and detailed.  The movies (which are the reason the game spans 3 discs) are also quite impressive.  The sound is excellent, from eerie music down to the footsteps that let you know an enemy is pacing around the corner...\nThe controls..well..they're annoying.  If you've never played a survival horror game, the stiff controls will prove to be a great annoyance.  If you're a survival horror veteran, they'll be a familiar annoyance.  Having to charge up your psychic powers in order to attack with any effectiveness adds to the frustration as it's sometimes hard to target fast moving enemies while charging, leading you to miss often and waste your PPECs..\nOverall, I'd say don't buy this game, rent it.  It's a rather enjoyable game with a great storyline and entertaining puzzles.  However, as I stated earlier, it will only last you a couple nights, and since the main thrill of the game is following the storyline and figuring out the puzzles, it has practically no replay value.","summary":"An enjoyable survival sci-fi game with some flaws","unixReviewTime":1031702400,"vote":"5","style":null,"image":null}

OK, so being \"THE ROCK\" or \"STONE COLD\" is fun for a bit, and it's great pounding the will to live out of the other wrestling greats, but believe me, it will start to bore you after awhile.\nWhat will make the replay value of this game skyrocket is the ability to make your own wrestler. This game has one of the better \"create-a-guy-of-your-own\" features on any playstation game. My wrestler, Big Nasty, is 7 feet tall, 500 lbs, wears a samauri mask and a hawaiian shirt.

The Mechanists have bought their way into high society by providing high tech servants and security for the city's upper class.

The main thing I found to be problematic was the fact that the Mechanists have replaced a great deal of the torches with electric lights.

Instead, it just holds its own.  I know that the original \"Thief: The Dark Project\" was not running all the latest technology when it was released orignally.  In fact the graphics engine was severely lacking as opposed to the other First Person perspective games that were available at the same time, a-la Quake 2.  What made it a standout though was the incredible gameplay.  The stealth element did a great deal to make the player feel that he\/she was in the shoes of Garett.  Thief 2 is fun, but it doesn't offer enough in the way of innovations.  In fact I think that the keyboard\/mouse control scheme in the first Thief game were more intuitive.  My second major complaint has to do with the enemies.  The AI actually seemed to take a dive in this game compared to that of the first.  This was not a problem with the human enemy characters, but the metalic enemies are just plain dumb and annoying.  I hate it when First Person games have aliens and robots hunting me.  They are much less scary than intelligent human AI.  Anyway, the graphics are better, run in higher resolution, and with a better color pallet than \"...The Dark Project\" but these improvements do not forgive the more mediocre gameplay.\nIn summation: If you are looking for the best of this series, get your hands on a copy of \"Thief Gold.\"  It is \"Thief: The Dark Project\" but it includes a few extra levels.  If you have already played the first and loved it, give \"Thief 2\" a try, but don't expect the sequel to impress you like the first.","summary":"The O.K.

Set in a fantasy world you play Garrett a master thief. Thief had a great story and fantastic ending, Thief2's story is a quite silly but there are lots of twists in the plot and the cutsence avi movies are great. The gameplay is superb you need to sneak your way through the levels by staying in the shadows and avoiding full frontal combat. The atmosphere is also superb as most of the missions take place at night and it is very creepy. The level desinging is superb, The 15 missions in are very large and the objectives will be hard to complete, In one level you cant kill anyone, In another you cant blackjack anyone, In another you need to finish without any conferntations with the locals. But the game will be very easy once you have learnt how to sneak, i have complteted the game on the expert difficulty without any problems. Missions like the life of the party and trial of blood can be played over and over again. But i miss the zombie and haunts missions of the first game. Enemy AI is very impressive the gaurds react well to every little sounds. New villans are not good, i did like the robotic gaurds, It is hard to belive that anyone would keep a giant robo cop which shoots cannon balls at intruders in their posh mansion. Try to get thief version 1.07 because it will give you a great replay value. The mission maps in the unpatched version and the patched version are quite different. Buy 1.07 play it and then patch it to 1.18 and replay it again with slightly different mission.\nThief2 is built on the modified dark engine, i played it on the Direct3D video mode and the game runs very well. T2 looks a lot better than the first game, Graphics are not great but more than enough. The levels are very long but the game loads and saves data very quickly. Sound recording is very good, Voice acting also is superb but the main villan karas needs a throat surgery. The sound can be annoying at times as the villans keep talking all the time. Gaurds and the small robots will keep on saying nonsence that it may force you to send a couple of arrows to shut them up. Thief II is a good sequal to thief but not as good as the first, Though it has some of the best thief missions like Life of the party. Thief Dark Project was like a medival horror game with zombies, But t2 has went far away from that story to sci friction. Still it is worthy of your money thief serries games are one of the best out there. Finally though there is not an expansion pack, Thief games have got a lot of fan made add on missions and most of them are well made and a lot of fun to play like benny's dead and smuggler request for example, Go to eidos thief forums to get them, you will surely love them.","summary":"Thief II - The Metal Age","unixReviewTime":1013904000,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Buy Thief II after that.  There are some spoilers in the sequel that you don't want to see.\nYou can tell that the designers listened closely to the feedback from the players of Thief I.  They made a lot of great improvements, which are what make Thief II worth buying.  Remember the mosters and zombies from Thief I?  They're gone.  Most of the missions in Theif II are human-oriented.  Remember those long and tediuos \"needle-in-a-haystack\"  missions?  They're gone too.  The missions in Thief II are quite a bit more interesting, they are shorter, and they are easier to complete.  Plus, each mission has one major goal that is something other than stealing.  It's up to you to decide how much you want to pillage.  For instance, in one mission your goal is to frame someone by planting evidence in his office (that mission was a blast).  The guards have more of those amusing conversations that you like to listen in on -- the guards have me laughing out loud sometimes.  Garrett makes his little cynical comments more often.  The maps are a hundred times better and easier to use (no more getting lost).  The graphics are slightly better, and there are other little improvements as well like new toys for Garret.\nSome of the changes for Thief II were not so good.  For one thing, the designers may have taken out the zombies, but they added in these absurd security cameras and patrolling robots.  Robots?  Garrett is using a bow and arrow, but there are robots patrolling around.  It's just too silly to ignore.  If you think it sounds lame then just wait until you actually see what they look like and sound like.  In general, the technology improvements for Thief II go so overboard that they take away from the game.  The medieval setting was a great part about Thief I but it's not there in Thief II.\nMy biggest complain about Thief II would be the overall storyline.  Thief I simply had a brilliant storyline that was downright creepy and involving.  I don't want to give away too much, but Thief II has some plot twists that will have you saying \"come on, give me a break!\"  It totally lacks the overall feeling of gloom and suspense that was there for Thief I.\nStill, I have liked Thief II better than Thief I.  The flow of the levels must be the reason why.  It took me months to complete Thief I, because I got tired of a lot of the long levels.  I am almost done with Thief II in less than a couple weeks.","summary":"Lots of changes.  Some good, some not-so-good","unixReviewTime":991612800,"vote":"5","style":null,"image":null}

Only recently I have managed to upgrade my system and it is now quite playable.  That being said, it tends to require a fairly high end system to play well.  A P2 300 with 64 megs of RAM will not handle it all that well even if you turn all the details off, this is rather an annoyance since though the graphics are rather good they are not terribly great compared to other FPS style games of the time.  Speaking of graphics, one thing that though minor became quite an annoyance for me was the fact that when characters speak their lips do not move.  Almost any FPS game released at the time of Thief 2 had this feature and though minor it was sort of annoying, though it can be overlooked with the game's many better features.  That being said, lets take a look at some of the better features of this game.  For starters it features the same style of gameplay as the original Thief, which might be a turn-off for those who are used to the 'run-and-gun' type shooters, in Thief you are not a human tank, you are just a normal person and a single gaurd is easily capable of killing you.  Rather, the goal is to sneak around them or take them down from behind (preferably silently as a death scream tends to alert others in the building).  I did not find the plot as engaging as the first game, but it is still quite enjoyable.  There seems to be more of a focus on human opponents and whatnot in this game, and this is a definite improvement IMO as I found some of the original's monster filled levels to be annoying in the extreme.  Some of the objectives can be rather tedious and even repetitive but I still find it a thrill to crawl through the levels trying to steal as much gold, equipment, or other valuables as one possibly can.  Also, there are some new twists on objectives, one being a mission wherein you break into a police station at night to frame one of the officers by stealing something from the evidence vault and leaving it in his quarters, and stealing a personal item from his office and dropping it in the evidence vault.  To make matters more difficult, you can knock out or kill only five gaurds on normal difficulty, or two on hard difficulty, or none on expert.  Kill or knock unconcious anymore than that and the mission is failed as they will then realize that someone must have framed him.  Though it is fun right out of the box, you will definitely want to get the latest patch... as it fixes many problems, be warned those (like me) whom are limited to 56k, it is a large patch (approximately 33 megs) but worth the download.  Though there are still some minor bugs... it fixes the most glaring bugs and the AI's stupidity level is far reduced with the patch.  Its a shame Looking Glass Studios (Thief 2's developers) went out of business shortly after making this game as I've no doubt there would have been further patches to correct the remaining problems.  In any case, it is still a very enjoyable game despite the problems and less than stellar graphics that I've mentioned.","summary":"Flawed, but still fun","unixReviewTime":987897600,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

It has all the sadistic,horrific charm you would expect in such a title. As an ax-weilding,demented research subject you start out by breaking out of your asylum,and then venturing to diffrent cities like London and Paris.\n To get the feel of the game,you can start off in \"therapy\" mode (training),where two monsters will continualy generate so you can practice you moves. After you have hacked at your foe enough,\na \"FATALITY\" message will appear. At that time you can finish him by lopping off his head,and the chopping up the monster's corpse\nwith blood splatter galore. There are other diffrent kinds of finishing moves you can execute,but this is the only move that the game tells you how to do(X,X,O).\n\n Voice acting is well done,but there is a problem with the soundtrack...while you might get hooked in by the \"Rob Zombie\" headline,his music only plays during cinemas...not during the gameplay. While you are playing the game,what little music there is,is standard Resident Evil type music. That's really too bad, because Rob Zombie's music would have definatly went with this type of gameplay.\n\n The graphics although a bit dated,are still very good in my opinion. The monsters look more twisted as you progress(the guys with chainsaws!),and the enviroment perfectly reflects the dark nature of this game. However sometimes the game uses the \"pitch black dark effect\" making it very difficult to see where you are going....you'll probabally have to adjust your tv lighting\n\n There is also a fair amount of puzzel solving,(find the switch, get the dynamite to blow up the wall,move bookcase to find hidden\ndoor)but none of it is TOO difficult,in fact sometimes the answer\ncan be so obvious,but you just tend to overlook it.\n While it's a great guilty pleasure to watch this madman splatter blood all over the walls,Nightmare Creatures 2 suffers from the \"Duke Nukem Syndrome\".By that I mean to fully enjoy this game,you have to use the cheat modes(invinciblity,and unlimited ammo).Just like duke nukem,I can't see how anyone could possibly beat this game without them.

And finally, many people call this the most addictive gamme ever, I personally get very bord after playing for an hour. Do not get me wrong this game is fun. But I just do not think it is worth the price.","summary":"Fun but...","unixReviewTime":983577600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}
{"overall":4,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"02 15, 2001","reviewerID":"A1NSMQIF1C2VCE","asin":"B00004NS01","reviewerName":"Beau Yarbrough","reviewText":"I'm not sure what I expected to get out of \"EverQuest,\" having heard some opinions from people who are much more hardcore gamers than I am, but here's what I got out of it:\n\"EverQuest\" is not a regular computer game. You don't pop it into your computer, go whack a certain number monsters on the head, win, and then deinstall it. Those games are a lot of fun, but once you've, say, killed Diablo several times with different character types in \"Diablo II,\" you're not exactly rushing to do it the 300th time. Not by any means. (Great game, \"Diablo II,\" but a different sort of animal altogether.) Those that see \"EverQuest\" as a big online \"Quake\" game seem to get very frustrated with many aspects of the game, including other players, and the feeling is usually mutual.\nThat's because, instead of \"Diablo,\" \"EverQuest\" is more akin to a huge themed chat room interwoven with a game. Sure, you can and do play by yourself sometime, but you have to hunt far and wide across the game world of Norrath to find a place where you won't be interacting with someone else. (For the record, you can find it: Go to the Tox Forest south of Erudin, and swim west from the docks. The Kerra Isle zone is almost always empty, and it's especially so inside, if you choose not to hunt the native cat people, but instead do the quests for them. The quiet is a nice change from the sometimes deafening roar that pervades most EQ zones.)\nIn fact, the game is designed to more or less force you to work with other players: After getting your character (selected from either sex, multiple fantasy races and about as many fantasy hero\/villain careers) up a few levels whacking the more mundane monsters and animals, you pretty quickly run into a wall where it becomes much harder to go at it alone. Jack may have been a giant-killer in the fairy tale, but if you want to kill giants in EQ, you're going to need friends. And that's what makes EQ a killer app: Interaction. You may think you aren't interested in making a bunch of online friends, but you'll soon find yourself laughing with, cursing with and adventuring with strangers from around the globe. I have no idea who some of the people I play with are beyond the vaguest details, but it doesn't matter. I get to jump into this fantasy world and I've got brave friends who have my back as I have theirs, ready and waiting.\nHardcore gamers, as I alluded to earlier, will quibble about some of EQ's technical specifications. First off, I've had very few technical problems. I can almost always connect within 30 seconds, have been kicked off line only twice in over six weeks of play, and the dreaded \"lag\" where the game continues by the connection between server and home computer can't keep up, has rarely been a problem. It occurs, but it's not very problematic, and even the harshest EQ critics acknowledge that it's getting better all the time.\nThere's also some talk that the graphics, especially in the original section of EQ (the continents of Antonica and Faydwer, and the island of Odus) aren't up to par, but I don't get the argument. Setting the game at maximum resolution (because I've got a late model computer), the graphics are gorgeous, and I haven't even explored the prettier (and more graphics-intensive) continent of Kunark yet.\nFor fantasy fans, EQ strikes a good balance between the familiar and the new. Many players want to play traditional elves and dwarves, and those areas of Faydwer are packed to the gills (particularly the elvish areas of the Faydark forest). You can help a sickly unicorn, slay dragons, play as a hobbit-like halfling and battle fierce orcs. Or, if you need another Tolkein-inspired fantasy game like you need a hole in the head, you can be an Erudite magician from far-off Odus (EQ has included a fantasy race of color, the Erudites, with a lightly African-themed look to them, and has made them the preeminent masters of all sorts of magic, good and evil, in the world of Norrath), exploring the deadly continent of Kunark and battling the native lizard peoples, the Iksar, there. (The Iksar are also a playable race, for those looking for an extremely distinctive character type.)\nThere's more to this game than can be covered in this review -- characters can develop skills beyond the ability to kill each other; my gnome wizard is an accomplished linguist, for instance, meaning that I've had to sit down with more than a dozen player-controlled characters of non-gnomish descent and share language lessons -- as EQ is a rich, deep, surprisingly immersive game.\nEverything they say is true: EQ is addictive. And there's lots of good reasons why. A terrific game, and my household has two copies, one for me, and one for my wife.","summary":"Why am I writing a review?

It is extremely addictive, and I say that from  experience. As for the actual game, the graphics are wonderful, not as good  as say Quake 3 but better then any other Online RPG out there. The game  play is good, combat can get a little boring and monotonous if you let it.  The interface is not very user friendly, with a manual that is better  tossed in the garbage then read, EverQuest is not a game for newbies. The  game is good but not perfect, it has some serious balance issues,  especially in the PVP (player vs player) department. And you will find your  self using the ignore command often with all the immature kids who play. If  you are looking for a real role playing game don't bother here. Very few  people role play in EverQuest, which overall degrades the experience. The  kunark expansion, adds a new race (Iksar) and a new continent to explore.

The game isn't simply between aliens and predators, but also with the added human character to add a different side to the story and adding, hopefully, more depths and variety to the game. Designed for intermediate to professional pc gamers, the game isn't for those who are slow and clumsy, bad of memory or heart, or those not into games like these.\nHowever, looking over the other side, the game A.I. needs much improvements, human counterpart should be even out slightly more, and more levels should be added. However, for the cost and the date it was made, its better than many games made to this present day.\nJust think about fighting an alien that, instead of running straight at you, will instead, hit and run and use cover of the darkness and walls more.

From Alien to Predator 2, the average fan can usually recall and say, verbatim, just about any line from each movie. We each have our favorites too...mine is Aliens, and AvP borrows heavily from it and Predator to establish it's basic premise and it's incredibly eerie atomosphere.\nOh, the atmosphere is perfect...I don't think the designers could have made it any more frightening than it is. This is especially true if you're playing as a Colonial Marine. Of the three species, this will be the one you're liable to grab first. And why not? You're a human, you understand guns, how to shoot em', and blow up stuff. The engine is superb...the graphics are outstanding...to this day I cannot play this game at night. Laugh if you must, but between the \"beep...beep...beep..beep..BEEP!\" of the motion tracker detecting aliens you can hear but cannot see, to the very accurate sound and fire pattern of the M-41A Pulse Rifle...I'm not joking when I say it's like being in the movie \"Aliens\".\nThe Predator portion is equally outstanding. Every sound has been dutifully rendered into the game from the silver screen, so that when you cloak and look in thermal view at some inept human walking down a corridor, you really do feel all-powerful, especially when you hit them with deadly accuracy with your shoulder cannon. Every weapon is powerful, and depending on which species you're fighting, each will be more important than others at different times.\nThe Alien has to be my least favorite species to play as. For one, I'm not afraid to run around, since I *become* the thing to be feared, but then again, damage is easily inflicted on you, although your speed can help lower that a bit. The only other problem I have with the Alien mission portion is basically summarized by PC Gamer's review of it when it said something like \"To accomplish your mission objectives like it was on a to-do list on the Alien Queen's clipboard feels somehow *wrong*\".\nMultiplayer is a blast, but with only a limited selection of maps to play on and no means to make your own multiplayer levels, you'll grow weary on it after a while. Cooperative missions are my least favorite...several marines basically try to hold off huge and endless waves of Aliens that respawn regularly...ad infinitum. It'd be nice to have a scenario where a group of marines would have to go through a maze or complex to accomplish some mission that would have a definite end to it. But it usually ends up being 3-4 marines backed up into a corner firing at everything they see.\nOverall this is a fantastic game, one that once you start playing you won't want to stop. Except at night, when you're all alone.","summary":"Is this gonna be a stand up fight, sir, or another bug hunt?","unixReviewTime":1006041600,"vote":"13","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

When I first started playing, this game was so frustratingly impossible, but when you get used to it, it stops being impossible and starts being a challenge.  This game definitely makes  wonderful use of all the source materiel, giving us a wonderful  cinematic-feeling experience.  Now you can sympathize with what all those  people were feeling in the Alien movies.\nThe Alien is probably the  hardest to play as.  Granted it moves really fast and can walk on walls,  but no ranged weapons, and no medkit, leave you exceptionally vulnerable to  the marines' rapid fire weaponry.\nThe Marine levels are also extremely  difficult, because as soon as an alien gets under your arc of fire, you're  good as dead.  Fortunately, you get a full range of fun weapons.\nBut the  easiest, if least fun, is the Predator.  Exceptionally strong, with  auto-aiming vision, sniper weapons, and auto-recharging ammo, this guy's  levels are, at first, a lot easier than the other two.\nEach of the  characters has his own, linear, campaign, but these campaignes have nothing  to do with each other.  The multiplayer's lots of fun, the sounds are  excellent, the graphics are high-res, and run well, even with all the  features on, on a low end system.  Plus, it takes less than 300 megs of HD  space and it doesn't require the CD!  The music, while not award-winning  materiel, is moody, and the predator music recognizably borrows materiel  from his movie theme, while the Marine and Alien music is similar to the  Aliens action themes.\nThe enemies aren't incredibly diverse, but they're  tough and they look cool, so that doesn't matter too much.  And don't worry  about the difficulty level...The gold edition comes with the strategy  guide.  Overall, this is a very fun and addictive, if very hard, game to  add to your collection.

The third person camera for the game is a very good choice and the view is flawless. The weapons are also very good, all of them close combat weapons like swords, mace, axe ect, They can be made very powerfull when charged with rune power. You could also pick up a severed limb or head of the enemy you defeated and fight using that as a weapon, Really cool. And to restore health your charecter eats lizards (yuck!), leg of meat ect.

I tried the demo first and was pleased enough to buy the game.  I certainly haven't been disappointed with this game.\nLet me tell you the bad news first because there isn't much.  Rune has an excess of jumping puzzles.  Jumping puzzles can be fun, and some of these puzzles in Rune are engaging, but it gets to the point that I say enough!\nOK, here's the good news.  Rune has perhaps the best graphics in any game I've played.  In one of the levels the software renders a very convincing reflective floor.  And the artwork is great!  Many of the levels take you into a rich fantasyland full of monsters, dwarves, huge buildings, and steam-belching machines.  And despite what the critics have alleged, Rune has plenty of intense combat where your survival is rarely assured, and the levels nicely compliment this combat.\nIf you like Unreal you'll probably like Rune.

The people actually performed different actions like walking around and jumping super high in the air and performing other things that were absent in the first game, like walking and fighting in the cut-scenes.\nI only have a couple of complaints: the missions and enemies at times were extremely difficult and getting caught just once or twice could make you a novice in no time at all.

With all the negative things aside, I'd like to focus one more positive: getting the chance to play as the bad guy. The new ninja Tatsumaru gets amnesia and becomes evil, taking on missions for the villain Lady Kagami and even fighting his old allies Azuma Shiunsai, Rikimaru, and Ayame. This game (being a prequel to the first one) even shows how Rikimaru got that scar he has on his eye: Tatsumaru slashes it with Rikimaru's own future sword Izayoi when he had his guard down. \"Tenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins\" was a great, yet challenging, game. I can't wait till Part 3 comes out for the Playstation 2.","summary":"The assassins strike back!","unixReviewTime":1023321600,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

I don't know why it has that name, but Ogre Battle is a good name. Behind the subtitle is a very good game. It does suffer many flaws, and may not be for everyone, but makes all of that up with its depth.\n\nYou begin your adventure as Magnus, a young warrior in the Western Division. In your party you have a friend\/rival, Dio; a tactician, Hugo; and the potential love interest, Leia. This game doesn't focus so much on character development as it does plot or gameplay. There are so many characters that you don't get to know all of them. The ones you get to know the most are those outside of your army. But, since character development was not the main focus of the game, I will not focus on that.\n\nThere is an extensive tutorial to teach you all of the game's basics and then some. You start out with pre-made units consisting of soldiers, archers, and specialty characters. Units are organized into three-by-three squares that you can organize however you like. Ideally archers go in the back and soldiers in the front. As you progress you can look for neutral characters to join your side. You can use these characters to create new units, and the game provides plenty of soldiers to fill in any missing gaps your unit may have. Units are fully customizable. Since the game puts characters in bad positions in the units, it's often a good idea to place them in more strategic positions. Each character performs a different action whether placed in front, in the middle, or in the back. These actions can range from the amount of attacks they unleash to changing their attack type from melee to magic. In each unit, up to five small characters (those that take up one space) can be together. If you have one large character, such as a dragon, you can only have three small characters with it, and only one small character with two large characters. This also adds to the strategy.\n\nNow for the actual combat. Since this is also a \"simulated\" game, you have limited control over your characters. This is where some gamers may be turned off. On the main battle field, you set your units along certain paths to liberate strongholds and chase down enemy units. It's up to you to keep an eye on each unit, because fatigue can affect battles and the last thing you want is for an enemy to creep up on your sleeping party. Once combat has begun, you just sit back and watch. This can be rewarding when your party executes brilliantly, but it's frustrating when your party behaves stupidly.\n\nDespite those flaws, this is a very fun experience. It's a lengthy game that can easily consume hundreds of hours of your life, so you'll be pretty busy for a month or two - a very memorable time.","summary":"One of the N64's lengthiest and most addictive outings","unixReviewTime":1371600000,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Copperthite","reviewText":"First off, I agree that this game is more strategy than Role Playing.  You go into a battle screen where you advance your armies onto the map, liberating towns and pushing back enemy units, until you get to the main boss of the map, beat him, and you win that area.  This is definitely just the abstract, however.\nIf you like character customization, you will literally fall head over heels for this game.  You have units of characters in your total party - each consisting of 5 characters or 4 if you have a large monster in that particular unit.  You can change their classes, train them outside of regular battles, level them up, re-equip them, etc.  Also, where you put the character changes what they do in battle.  And it also changes the attack and defense of the entire unit.  You can change everything about your characters and units that if you love having control of everything, you won't be disappointed.\nWhat may turn many away from this game, however, is the battling.  The strategy is almost entirely how you make the formation of the battle unit.  You dictate one of four strategies and they fight on their own.  You can intervene and change the strategy in the battle, but that's it.  You can retreat from a battle too, and then a little later in the game you can cast \"Pedra\" spells on the enemy, which are spells you get to use if you have taken a lot of damage in a particular battle.  Once each character has performed every action, the winner is the side which dealt the most damage, or of course the surviving side.  There's more strategy than it seems however, in that you need to push units around the map with each other, and stopping in towns to restore each characters HP before they die.\nThe story is a little cliche', but it is still a good story.  Full of corruption, deceit, and backstabbing within lines.  There are alternate paths and multiple endings too, and even if there weren't you'd probably want to play the game again once you beat it.\nThe N64 has been known for its children-oriented games.  Parents beware:  this game has some bad language and the scenes are full of all kinds of animated violence.  I'm not a parent, nor a young kid, but I know there are plenty of parents who watch what their kids play.\nFor RPG-starved N64 owners this is a great game to buy.

Ogre Battle series is 70% strategy and 30% Role Playing. With that in mind, here is my review...\nSince this is a strategy game more than RP, I gave it 4 Stars for one reason alone. It is not as challenging as the first Ogre Battle (March of the Black Queen). Do not get me wrong, it can be challenging at times and even frustrating at times but the 1st OB was much harder. Example: the bosses in this game are far easier. The first OB for the SNES still stands out in my mind w\/ bosses like the Gemini Twins, Diablo, etc.\nAnother thing to consider... if you are someone who HAS TO have complete control during a fight, than it is a good bet you will *not* enjoy this game. You are basically a general of a battilion giving orders and watching them carry out those orders. The best part of the game is designing your army. You can create a battle unit to emplore all your favorite classes (e.g. Princess which provides extra attack, Lich for brute dark magic, Dragoon for sheer strength, Paladin for his holy attacks, Black Knight for evil attacks, etc.) Combine these characters to make an army you want! And you have plenty of choices, I could waste a lot time just spewing all the characters in this game. You can pair up wizards to make spells combine for a different spell (e.g. Earth and Fire combine for Lava Shot) and more damage. That is the attraction and the strategy part.\nThe other attraction is the storyline, which is better than the 1st OB. It is not the best storyline across all games, but it is also modifable. Sometimes a small decision you make costs the life of someone dear. There are 3 MAIN endings to the game. There can be small differences in those endings depending on the storyline characters you recruit. This is what gives the game a replay value ...to try different routes in the game and see different endings and different story points and try for other storyline characters ...in my next game I am going for Biske (a werewolf boss).\nThere are A LOT of nuisances to this game. More than you can imagine. Stuff like removing a character from a unit will lower the morale of the unit ...but you can not see the morale of a unit (i.e. hidden from you). So, read the Internet, DO NOT buy the Prima Strategy Guide unless you really want it. It has some incorrect information and not enough of the good information. Visit OB64 websites, not prima guide! Personal websites, not business websites. I don't know if I can legally post mine here so I am not going to chance it. Also, read the manual and Hugo's Report (in the game). The game has a nice feature of letting you view past movies and good advice - take advantage of that.\nIt is a GREAT game, but mostly for people who love strategy games like Romance of the III Kingdoms and even RP gamers. I play all types (action, racing, rpg, strategy, fighting), but I will say this... I enjoy strategy and RP games more than fighting (got silly after the 2nd Street Fighter). Someone who loves 1st person shooters and fighting games above all else may be irritated more than enthralled. Then again I probably couldn't count all the hours I have wasted playing Bond in the dorm rooms!\nYour decision, not mine but I provided my inputs ...make up your own mind.","summary":"King of Strat\/RP Games","unixReviewTime":974764800,"vote":"19","style":null,"image":null}

In the Christmas of 1996, the Nintendo 64 arrived.\n\nThe Nintendo 64, or N64 as it is sometimes referred, followed in the wake of success of the first Sony console, the PlayStation, and started producing their games with 3D graphics. Instead of limiting the player to only being able to move forward and backward, or left and right, you could now move in all directions. This opened a portal for Nintendo to take some of their classic characters and put them in truly immersive worlds. For example, Mario was no longer a 16-bit side scrolling red and blue pixel, but a small Italian man with a healthy knack for adventure. Being able to see these characters up close and all around was something like we had never seen before. The result ended up being games like Super Mario 64, Star Fox 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and the countless hours and vivid gameplay that they would offer.\n\nWith a very simple design and set up like the previous 2 Nintendo consoles (SNES & NES) the 64 was another cartridge based Nintendo console with no load times and generally easy maintenance (remember blowing into the cartridges and consoles?). The controller however, was something that was dramatically different from both previous Nintendo consoles. This controller offered an analog stick and more than the standard 2 or 4 buttons. The analog stick was great for the 3D games and made it very easy to navigate, however, after enough hours of play it stop working in one way or another.\n\nIt's interesting to see how Nintendo has come full circle, evolving to something like the Nintendo 64 and in some ways digressing back to it's origins with games like New Super Mario Bros U, which is much like Super Mario Bros for SNES but with updated graphics and a few more tweaks.","summary":"Nintendo Explores New Territory in 64-bit","unixReviewTime":1393804800,"vote":"2","style":{"Color:":" Ice","Edition:":" Color"},"image":null}

Whatever you do, don't listen to the product information. You can't play 2-player, and you certainly can't play as Tails. Sonic has to rescue Tails. I think the plot is very poor, but that's probably because Tails is my favorite Sonic character (other then Metal Sonic and Omega) and I think it's absurd that Tails would have to get rescued because Eggman took him from his home. The Genesis version's plot is much better-it has 2-player battle and cooperation, and Tails makes a great first impression on Sonic by helping him get to the Death Egg.\n\nPros:\n 1-Sonic has a better color palette then in Sonic 1. Although he isn't his original cobalt blue, he's still a brighter shade of blue other then Sonic 1's faded sky blue shade.\n 2-The locations are pretty fun, and I don't think it's a problem that they don't relate to the Genesis version. It provides more of a variety and shows that Sonic Team is creative with Sonic's exploring grounds.\n 3-The different activities (riding in a mine cart, hang-gliding) make the different locations stand out from the others and make them more unique, especially how the activities relate to the locations.\n 4-The graphics have improved, and they don't have the blurry feel there was in Sonic 1. The scenery relates more to Sonic rather than looking poorer than Sonic himself.\n 5-The bosses are more challenging than Sonic 1's easy to beat bosses (ex: Eggman hovering around pointlessly). They're also more creative like the bosses in Sonic Chaos.\n\nCons:\n 1-Tails isn't playable, so it's kind of like an extension to Sonic 1 just with a different plot. Mostly, it's nothing new.\n 2-The plot is exactly the same as Sonic 1 just this time he saves the animals of Westside Island instead of South Island and Tails is thrown in there.\n 3-Some of the zones are fun and challenging, while others are just long and hard. It depends mostly on how you look at them.\n 4-The badniks don't have much of a new design and most of them are kind of boring. They just disappear in a cloud unlike how animals\/seeds usually come out. Some badniks have a special stragety for defeating them, so that's okay.\n\nThat's all the pros\/cons I have. Overall, I recommend it if you can get it for a price under $10.

The best part is it sells for next to nothing even if it's still sealed in the box. Still, I would reccomend this game, no matter what the price. That's because it's priceless. But there's a major and known flaw that I must tell you about in this game. Let's go into the depths of Sonic 2 for GameGear...\nThe Graphics: Excellent! Sonic looks real, his facial expressions are clear, and all of the worlds are colorful and well drawn out. Nothing bad here.\nThe Sound: Pretty good. When you jump, it makes a boing noise. Sounds are very simple and to the point. Nothing fancy.\nThe Music: Excellent again! The first act has the best tune ever! The music for boss battles is excellent as well.\nThe Gameplay: What would this game be without gameplay? Basically, this is Super Mario Bros. with a hedhog and fancier levels. You run around, collect strange coins, and try to avoid trechorous obstacles. Now, the enemies aren't much of a problem in this game. They seldomly appear and are easy to do away with. The challenge is the obstacles and bosses, which I'll explain in a minute.\nThe Challenge: Once you beat this one, you're going to want to run around and spread the news. The bosses are EXTREMELY challenging, although some of them tend to be very easy as well. Obstacles also make tretchery. In some places, you must trust the game. This is because there are blind jumps. You just leap and let the game send you to where you need to go. Sometimes the key is to sort of relax and let it go. Trust your instincts. Trust the game. Never will there be a blind jump that the game will kill you with. You just have to go with the flow.\nReplay Value: Most levels have many secrets and more than one route to take to the end making replay high. You may have to beat the game more than twice just to get all the secrets. It also plain fun. Alot of the bosses are fun, too. Just a cool game.\nShould I buy it?: YES! BUY THIS GAME! It is very cheap, can be found in the box for the most part, and is FUN.

With a solid library of quality games, amazing 64-bit graphics and sound, and smooth controls, this is a good investment for any video game lover.\nHere are the Pros: While being cart-based, it avoids the pitfalls of the CD format. Mainly, load times. The games load fast, save fast, and without slowing down your enjoyment of the game. The games are also a strength. The best games available are: \"Zelda: Ocarina of Time\", \"Goldeneye 007\", \"Starfox 64\", and \"Donkey Kong 64\". The graphics in the aformentioned games have a quality that only 64-bit can provide. The animation is smooth, colorfull, and with a minimal of pixilation. The sound is crisp, clear, and with music that can melt candles. One of the most convenient pros of this system is the low number of peripherals the buyer needs to get. It often seems like one has to take a second job in order to afford the memory cards, expansion paks, rumble paks, and other dohickeys that enhance the experience but burn a hole in your pocket. The N64 expansion pak, memory cards, and the Rumble pak are very affordable, and are not going to get you back much. But only a fool would buy all the different color systems.\nHere are the cons: While the library of games is diverse, it is not as expansive as the Playstation. There is also a shortage of games for the more mature games. With the notable exception of \"Conker's Bad Fur Day\" and \"Perfect Dark\", the majority of the games are for kids-teenagers. The controler also takes a bit of getting used to, it is big and bulky, but thankfully not as clunk as the Dreamcast controller. Also, the cart-based format means less data, so shorter games. With the Playstation, you have Final Fantasy VII and IX, which expand over 3 and 4 CD ROMS respectively. No epic RPGs for the N64. Actually, with the exception of Zelda, I am hard-pressed to think of ANY RPGS that are available for N64\nOverall, the pros outweigh the cons. Technically, it is miles ahead of the Playstation. Game selection wise, it cannot hold a candle to the Playstation. The solution: Get both systems. But with the GameCube being slowly introduced, the N64 is not available Mid-Price, and the same goes for the games.","summary":"A great system...","unixReviewTime":1015372800,"vote":"5","style":{"Color:":" Ice","Edition:":" Color"},"image":null}

It's an instant classic.\nIn Oddworld, you play a slave called Abe, who works at the meat-processing plant Rupture Farms. Abe's a Mudokon, hardly your typical cute platform hero, but a gangly, orange-eyed, green-skinned creature with a samurai's tuft of hair and the posture of an ape. The story's premise is that the factory's owners have found a tasty new treat to whip into production since they ran their last \"dish\" into extinction. The problem is, it's you. Or more precisely, the Mudokons. When an eavesdropping Abe finds this out, he starts ham-stepping stage left, right quick, proving that curiosity can save the cat, too. Your goal, as Abe, is to escape Rupture Farms, liberating as many fellow Mudokons as possible, and find a way to bring down the entire plant. But playing a Christ figure isn't as easy as we'd all like to think. Using a limited vocabulary set, Abe must convince the Mudokons to follow him to safety, all the while racing through the factory flipping switches, avoiding obstacles, evading heavily armed guards, and staying alive.\nGive me more, we need more games like this one.","summary":"This game's the bomb!","unixReviewTime":1291420800,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

It is not enough to even call it a true \"classic\".  It's not only an absolute top quality puzzle-style game, but it has a great story, unique and original characters and settings, and beautiful graphics.  And just the originality of that beautiful new world, \"mythology\", and fantastic concepts make this game a cut above the rest!\n\nWhy is it \"Great\"?  It's a real puzzle game.  Not that there's always one solution, or a right or wrong way to do things, but it is a game that focuses on technique, creative thinking, finesse, and (sometimes) quick reflexes.  There is no life bar; the game doesn't focus on that, or combat, it focuses on simply being able to figure out a solution and being able to execute it.  And it's fun, not boring and repetitive, but also very challenging.  And you have unlimited lives, which makes for playing with friends a lot of fun as you can pass around the controller to see who has the best ideas and skills.  It is as much fun to watch as it is to play.\n\nOne of the original concepts behind the game was that the main character was supposed to be \"non-violent\", but that isn't entirely the case as there is violence of a sort.  The main character just isn't directly violent.  But this is one of the highlights of the game, not a detraction (as I, and most gamers, would normally consider it to be).  You can't just plow your way through levels: you have to think, watch, time your actions, and adapt to the challenges.  But, when you do get those few opportunities to just gun your way through a level, it only makes it that much more fun.\n\nAnd the game is tight.  The controls are very well done.  You can easily master the fast maneuvers to co-ordinate with the necessary actions and specific spacing needed.  You'll get frustrated in some hard areas, but you will be able to play fast and risky (just kind of show off) or you can play slow and cautious.  It's all up to you and if you want to take your time and get through it with as few attempts as possible or if you want to just try to fly through an area and risk killing yourself a lot.  Sometimes luck favors the brave.\nAnd the game environment is solid.  A very well done and\/or tested.  I don't recall ever finding anything that was glitchy.\n\nIf you like quality puzzle-focused games that have straight-forward challenges (the game doesn't scale or do anything cheap to mess with you - try to \"make the game more challenging\"), and enjoy a good storyline (with great humor that doesn't take away from the game), you really should check out Abe in Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee (and Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus).  It is a really great game that is nothing but quality.  This is definitely one of those rare games worth owning and replaying.","summary":"One AWESOME puzzle game in a Great New (Odd)World!","unixReviewTime":1269216000,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

I absolutely fell in love with this game the moment it started. I never played the orignal or second on the Sega CD.\n\nStoryline: What can I say, its your typical boy loves girl, girl gets kidnapped and boy saves world and girl. Fortunately, rpg's are great not because of the story but how the story is told and Working Designs did a brilliant job in the storytelling. They took the story and put a few twists here and there but not to the extreme or completely insane, they left it a simple story and made it an epic masterpiece. Lastly, this game has one of the most memorable villians in an rpg to date. Ghaleon is a great villian who has a great background story that unfolds extremely well during the game and in my eyes he ranks right up there with Sephiroth.\n\nCombat system: For whatever reasons Working Designs left it simple and turn based and keeping to the sprites instead of trying to make the fights 3-D. With games like FFVII, Legaia and others going 3-D this gave a lot of ridicule to the game itself, a very unfortunate thing too. It was nice for the characters to have only certain things they could do, like Alex could only use special sword attack and no magic as where Jessica could only use magic. It kept the fighting more tactical and also made everyone in the group important and not just a space filler.\n\nGraphics: Working Designs kept to the sprites and kept it looking a 32 bit rpg. They did do something to keep the story moving along with anime clips, wonderfully done by the way, which they used to introduce characters and to help the storytelling.\n\nMusic: The battle music gets repetitive and so does the traveling music as I think they could've done a better job in that department. The voice acting was done really well but the women's voices do get a bit high pitched at times and it happens to the guys on occasion.\n\nThe characters were developed nicely, each having their own background story which adds to your liking and caring about each of your character in your party. You can easily put 50+ hours in the game and also there are whats called Bromides to collect. Bromides are anime pictures in the game which you can collect throughout your travels-I believe there are 12 in all.\n\nExtras Disc: I watched it and enjoyed the voice actors and developers talking about how much fun they had making the game and what they did to add what they thought would help the game out.\n\nThis game despite its old-school graphics and traditional fighting system gets a 5 out of 5 for its wonderful story and loveable characters.","summary":"Can't say enough about this game....","unixReviewTime":1223510400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

While some of the older games from the SNES era are considered RPG classics despite very outdated looks, it's strange trying to do the same for Lunar since it wasn't quite as big or as mass-appealing. While yes graphically and storyline wise, this isn't exactly Vagrant Story or even Final Fantasy stuff, there was always an appeal to the Lunar games that made you forget about it and just enjoy it anyway.\n\nStory: You play as Alex from the town of Burg who wants to become just like the Dragonmaster Dyne. But an encounter with a Dragon has Alex, his pet dragon Nall and friend Luna on a quest to save the world where they'll be taken to floating cities and different cities to save the world of Lunar. Again it's not the most deepest and complex RPG plot but like a lot of classic fairytales and fantasy stories, there's a wide appeal for the story simply because of the charming characters and just the general atmosphere of the game.\n\nGraphics: You'll notice a difference between the new stuff and the \"revamped\" stuff. Basically the new is fully-animated cutscenes which help flesh out special events but usually they're served as character introductions. They're gorgeous with great character designs and they really stand out. Everything else is iffy since the overworld\/town stuff is incredibly simplistic with mini-sprites and character portraits during dialogue. But if you love Final Fantasy VI or Chrono Trigger, than this kind of graphic style is nothing.\n\nSound\/Music: Soundtrack was done by Noriyuki Iwadare who's quite talented at doing upbeat catchy themes and although music-wise it can get slightly repetitive, they're quite fun and the vocal tracks are quite stellar. Sound work otherwise is functional but not impressive as swords clang and enemies die with small groans but this isn't really one of those \"immersive\" sound worlds like Metroid or Bioshock where there is tons of ambience. The voice acting though is quite stellar and aside from the Metal Gear series, Lunar is usually mentioned among games that best use voice acting.\n\nGameplay: Lunar does something different (though not together uncommon) in that spells are actually gained when you obtain a certain level as opposed to finding them in the world, buying them from shops and the like. It encourages level grinding so you can obtain new spells though enemies can get just as bad since they can level up with you a little (mainly bosses though) but really it's just going through a dungeon, beating enemies - which are thankfully onscreen like Chrono series - finding item chests and making it to the boss and whomping them. There's also some collectables called bromides which are character artworks that show up as mini-cutscenes and since the ladies are quite lovely to ogle, I like collecting the things.\n\nSince there was extra care in the making of the game, we get some added stuff like the cd soundtrack, an artbook with a readily-available walkthrough inside (complete with funny captions, character artwork and interviews with game developers) and a map. Might not be the absolute best RPG to many people but there's lots of fans, myself included of course, and Lunar is one to pick up, or at least try.","summary":"4.5; an RPG classic remade","unixReviewTime":1203379200,"vote":"3","style":null,"image":null}

While the Sega CD system didn't last very long, Lunar did manage to get quite a following.  Unfortunately, because the Sega CD user base wasn't large, Lunar was overlooked by several gamers.  The game had a release on the very short lived Sega Saturn, but again, never reached audiences.  In 1999 Lunar finally reached a large audience.  The Playstation.  With several changes and updates from the original Sega CD version to make the story more complete and satisfying.\n\nLunar Silver Star Story Complete concerns itself with Alex.  He one day dreams of being a Dragonmaster.  Just like his hero, Dyne.  He figures he'll just have to keep dreaming, though.  Until his friend Ramus has a plan to go into the White Dragon cave and get a hold of the White Dragon Diamond.  Finally, a chance for Alex to go on an adventure.  But it ends up becoming much bigger than he ever dreamed.\n\nFor the most part, Lunar Silver Star Story has a cliched overly done storyline.  Despite that, however, it is one of the best in the genre because it has a fantastic cast of characters who are all well developed, a good sense of humor, one of the best villains in video game history as well as a very emotional story.  All these things make you forget the cliched storyline and make it something enjoyable and memorable.  The story also has a few really great looking anime cinematics and some incredibly good voice acting to help flesh out the humor and wit.  It also helps that the dialog is extremely well written.  Put simply, the story is presented very well.\n\nThe gameplay is dated, but that's to be expected for a game originally released in 1992.  Lunar has a straightforward combat system.  It's the simple turn based fare you've seen in dozens of RPGs.  You'll select an action for every character to do and then watch the battle play out as your enemies and you take turns.  Every character can either attack, use special techniques unique to only them use items and run away, etc.  Battles are contact based.  That doesn't mean enemies will simply let you waltz by.  Many enemies upon seeing you will give chase.\n\nLunar is by no means a complicated game.  Every character gains magic through levels (save for Alex who will get a few spells from meeting certain objectives in the story) and has their own unique magic.  For example, Nash is the only character who can cast Thunder Magic.  There are a few tidbits to the battle system that help flesh it out and keep it from being overly repetitive.  For one, characters who use staves can use them to cast spells that they otherwise might not be able to cast.  There's also a huge emphasis on strategy here.  Lunar is not an easy game by any stretch of the imagination.  Especially up against the bosses.  You'll find you have to move your characters all over the field and heal every turn to keep yourself a float.  To make matters even more difficult, you only have a limited number of items you can carry and on top of that, items at the market are quite expensive and monsters don't drop a lot of money.  So even though battles are contact based, it's probably best to fight as many as you can.  The only major problem with Lunar's battle system is that battles aren't quick.  Even normal battles can last for several minutes because of having to heal yourself constantly.  For the most part, though, the trip through the game is very rewarding.\n\nVisually, Lunar is a very colorful, artistic looking, smooth running game.  It doesn't push the Playstation to its limits, but it does manage to be a good game nonetheless.  The artistic design is incredibly well done, though.  So are the character portraits and animated cutscenes.  It's actually a very beautiful looking game, but it looks like a smooth over sixteen bit game too.  Luckily, this won't bother most gamers.\n\nIt sounds pretty good.  As mentioned before, the voice acting is some of the best in the industry.  Many of the tunes are quite catchy (particularly the world map and battle themes).  They're short tracks, though, so they loop real soon, which makes much of the music quite repetitive.  In the long run, though, you're getting quite a bit.\n\nLunar Silver Star Story Complete originally came with a lot of extras.  A soundtrack CD filled with the best tracks, a cloth map, a making of CD and a hardcover instruction booklet that even included a sample of the strategy guide made by Working Designs themselves.  It's quite the collector's item to have.\n\nLunar Silver Star Story Complete is a fantastic RPG that despite being released on the Playstation, was still fairly overlooked.  It does, however, retain a strong audience.  A fine game where the effort of the creators really shows through fantastic writing, a well crafted story and some of the most well developed characters to grace the genre.","summary":"One of the Best RPGs Ever Made","unixReviewTime":1199232000,"vote":"7","style":null,"image":null}

So it ended up here and although graphically it looks like it came from the Sega CD era, the other enhancements and not to mention the great story and characters is more than enough to get this. Just good luck finding it, since it was in such demand, Working Designs stopped making them and made it incredibly rare to find.\nThe story starts off in the town of Burg where the hero, Alex, dreams of becoming like his hero, Dragonmaster Dyne, who died under mysterious circumstances. Then the hero searches for the White Dragon to become like his hero and from there, he ends up in a battle for the entire land of Lunar. It seems like a straightforward story with plot twists you'll probably see a mile away but the way that it's executed is so masterful.\nThere's some much needed humor in the game involving some pop culture references, such as when a traveller tells Nall(a flying cat) how much licks does it take to get the the center of a Tootsie Pop when it was an owl in the commercial.\nThe music isn't incredibly memorable but it adds life and great background to each location and event the music is featured. The voice acting is amazing some great voices. The one thing that feels odd to me is the voice of Alex, Ashley Angel, is a member of the boy-band O-Town. Although it isn't the most baddest thing in the world, it feels odd.\nDon't expect mind-blowing visuals. These look quite old but they don't retract from the gameplay. The anime scenes though are incredibly beautiful that range from simple character intros to big plot points. The animation seems so colorful and vibrant rather than looking a little too \"adult\". Even has some CG elements like Luna's song on the boat or something further in the game I'm not spoiling for you.\nIf you can find it or borrow off somebody, play this immediately and experience the world of Lunar.","summary":"If it isn't considered a classic, it better be","unixReviewTime":1027382400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

There are some differences between the Sega CD version and the Playstation one though.  The graphics and color have recieved a noticable face lift, some areas have been edited or cut altogether, and a few items have also been left out.  The music (a prime feature in the Sega CD version) has been reworked also, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.  Another new feature is how you encounter enemies. You no longer are forced into random battles...enemies are now only in dungeons and can be seen by icons and therefore avoided in many cases.  Overall, this a great package even if the price tag is high.  The music CD and the documentary disc are nothing monumental, but fans will appreciate it.  If you have not played Lunar before and are a fan of RPGs, get this Playstation version while it's still available and find out why it created a cult following on the Sega CD.","summary":"A must have for RPG fans","unixReviewTime":982886400,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete brings me back to the good ol' days of RPGs before the likes of Final Fantasy VII and VIII were called the best RPGs ever by newbie gamers who just don't know any better. The story was flawless and breathtaking then, and yet, somehow, it all seems better this time around. What makes Lunar Lunar though is the fact that Working Designs was behind it. They can translate even the lamest games and make them playable (I even bought Shining Wisdom for my Saturn just because of Working Designs!). The people at Working Designs are a bunch of comedians. There are so many jokes in this game it's unbelievable (second only to Final Fantasy IX in humor). The game has received an upgrade in every single way, most notably, the graphics. Yes, the graphics aren't an important part of any game, but it's nice to see that they got an uplift this time around. Back to the story though. Everything about the story is perfect, it's beautiful, it's touching, and it's one of the best in any game I have ever seen. I could go into more detail...but you should really play it for yourself. What surprised me about playing Lunar again was the length of the game. It's pretty long. While not as long as its sequel, it still offers days of fun like I had with the original version. The characters themselves are great. Typical of their RPG times? Yes, but great nonetheless. Especially Alex and Nall, who I just loved. The difficulty of the game is very applaudable as well. Not incredibly difficult, but it's not easy either, and that's just another reason why I love this game so much. The one thing that didn't stand the test of time was the battles. They're very straight-forward and basic, nothing to it at all. It's just tap...tap...tap. Boring indeed. Thankfully the random number of battles isn't frequent. The packaging also needs mention. Lunar:SSSC comes with a nice box that contains a 100+ page leatherette hardbound artbook\/instruction manual, a making of Lunar CD, a music CD, and a full-color cloth map. Who loves ya? Working Designs! Unfortunately, new-school gamers might be put off by Lunar's old-school look and feel continuously asking \"Where's Bahamut Zero?\" This is unfortunate because it looks like Lunar might go back to the cult status it had on the Sega CD instead of selling by the truckloads like it deserves. Oh well...definitely their loss. Nevertheless, this is a masterpiece. Lunar:SSSC should be as mandatory as the controller for PSX owners. Truly one of the best RPGs of all time...hey, you know the drill: If you're a gamer, you owe it to yourself to buy this. Oh yes, don't forget to pick up the sequel as well.","summary":"A Classic Among Classics...","unixReviewTime":977270400,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}

First of all, I have to admit that it wasn't the chubby, badly drawn characters that drew me to the game, or even the wonderful cgi, complimenting the animation sequences, or the music, both of which are reasons in themselves for giving this game a try. What drew me to Lunar, was the thought of dragons, and the cat-like creature, Nall. That changed as soon as I got into the storyline.  Alex had lived in the small town of Burg all his life, with his companion, Nall, and Luna, a lovely young woman who Alex's parents had taken in.  Luna possesses a wondrous singing voice that ultimately gets her (and her friends) in quite a bit of trouble.  What I liked was that rather than set her up as the helpless damsel, Working Designs allowed Luna to accompany Alex on his quest to meet the white dragon.  She isn't much for fighting, but that magical voice of hers can charm, or frighten away most enemies. Along the way, we meet new friends, and new enemies.  Ultimately, it leads to (doesn't it always?) a battle between good and evil, with the sake of the world hanging in the balance! If you enjoy Ranma 1\/2, Jade Coccoon, or just like dragons and cat-like creatures with bad attitudes, then this game could be exactly what you're looking for! On last note: Please play this before you buy Lunar:Eternal Blue, because this is the original game, and it might help to clear some things up.","summary":"My Favorite Game So Far","unixReviewTime":971308800,"vote":"5","style":null,"image":null}

I know it was the one that got me hooked--to the point where I kept upgrading computers and peripherals just to keep up with the games.  I tried to replay Myst a year ago and found I couldn't figure it out (have I lost that many brain cells over the years?), didn't have the patience or something to keep at it.  But like a first love, I remember it very fondly and treasure it.  It's almost heart breaking to think that some day soon, as Windows continues to do upgrade to different styles of OS, newbies won't be able to experience Myst.  Just like so many young people will never know how it felt when rock'n'roll burst forth.  To confess, I liked the graphics in Riven better.  And I never liked Artus (whatever) or his two sons--thought they were all slackers and whiners with serious emotional problems.  I loved that you could not die and nothing attacked you--really allowed [me] to explore and indulge my curiosity.  Loved the details (little bugs that moved, atmosphere, just everything).  Sound effects and \"music\"--wasn't Myst one of the first to put visuals and music together?  All in all, many good things started with Myst.  I know it was the first computer game that spent time and money on the graphics (something I always appreciated).  At most places, the game play wasn't strictly linear so you could play in whatever order you wanted.  You could \"spin\" around and see everything.  It was totally mouse driven.  One feature I loved (but many others complained about) was that it was an empty world, you never had to\/got to interact with anyone else in Myst; for me it was somewhere of my own where I could explore to my heart's content, go back and walk around areas that I liked (like \"tree\" world (can't remember it's actual name) even after you finished that level.

Rand and Robyn Miller created a new type of game which diverted from the typical mass market and took off into a fascinating and innovative direction. It's hailed as a landmark in the industry and praised for both its aesthetics and story.\n\nI think that Myst is best described as an experience rather than merely a video game. Its creators strived to develop a world rich with detail and intrigue, with a subtle narrative intertwined into the strange yet beautiful surroundings. As the game begins, you are dropped onto the island of Myst without very much information to guide you. What immediately strikes you as unique about this experience is that there are no friendly characters to help you on your way, no enemies to fight, and not a very clear purpose. The game is largely about just exploring your surroundings and experimenting with different devices around the various worlds. This is what makes the game so immersive. The graphics of Myst, though not quite as extravagant as today's, were definitely of high quality. Cyan built its 3D world through an extensive layout of still images and QuickTime movies, and the end result is simply amazing. Navigation is node-based, meaning that you don't necessarily walk through the environment but rather point and click your way through your surroundings. Each new section loads as if you really had relocated, giving the appearance of movement. Making a 3D world in this manner might seem strange, but at the time it was a necessary shortcut to make it possible to run the game on computers without a lot of RAM and processor power. Even by today's standards, I still think the environments look impressive.\n\nSo what exactly does the gameplay entail? As you explore the island, you discover two journals with missing pages, each of which belong to Atrus's sons, Sirrus and Achenar. Your main objective is to travel through the different worlds, or Ages, and retrieve the missing pages from each book. As you recover each page, you learn more about each brother, and you must try to discover who is lying and who is telling the truth. In the end, it will be up to you to decide their respective fates. Your journey is not easy, for you will have to solve rather challenging puzzles in order to progress throughout the worlds. This can often be frustrating, for the puzzles' solutions are not always intuitive. It will take much patience and observation, and perhaps even a little help.\n\nThe sounds in this game are mysterious and enchanting. The soundtrack consists of strange, sometimes haunting tunes that blend in remarkably well with each respective area. Moreover, the sounds are integral to the gameplay, for some of the puzzles involve listening in addition to seeing. You will need to observe and interpret different sounds and apply that information to the challenges you face. This is yet another way in which you can truly become immersed within the game. The music makes your surroundings feel foreign and believable.\n\nMyst was groundbreaking for its time, and it started an incredible journey that would spark several sequels. It's an experience that is visually, musically, and intellectually stimulating, and though the game is a bit dated now, I still think it's worth playing if you enjoy a good challenge. As many have mentioned, the ending is somewhat anticlimactic, but at the same time it will most likely make you want to continue the adventure with Riven.","summary":"An immersive classic.","unixReviewTime":1150675200,"vote":"4","style":{"Edition:":" Standard","Platform:":" PC"},"image":null}

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy blowing away bad guys as much as anyone else, but it's nice to play something a little different every once in a while.  This game does not depend at all on weapons or killing anything, nor does it require you to do a lot of jumping or physically manuvering around obstacles.  It is entirely a \"thinking\" game.  The closest you get to physical action is the fact that some of the puzzles to solve are mazes.\nYou start the game stranded alone on the Island of Myst, with no idea how you got there, and no idea how to get home.  Your only clue is a note found on the ground near the island's library.  From this slender beginning, you learn about the history of the island, about Altus and his two feuding sons, Sirrus and Achernar, and the four mysterious Ages you must visit and explore.  Be sure and explore the Library thoroughly.  Check everything.  The books in the library contain important clues.  They are not strictly necessary to solve the game, but they help out a lot, especially the Mechanical Age (with the rocket ship).  Personally, I found the Channelwood Age the most difficult, but all of the Ages can be solved with a little logic, and thorough exploration.  Each Age is also filled with little trinkets and gadgets that don't really help you solve the game, but they reveal a LOT about the personalities of Sirrus and Achernar.\nVisually, the game is absolutely gorgeous.  Each Age has an entirely different look and feel to it.  The user interface is extremely simple and intuitive.  The haunting soundtrack and well-done QuickTime animations also add a lot to the overall feel of the game.\nThe only people you will actually interact with at all in the game are the aforementioned Altus, Sirrus, and Achernar.  This leads me to my one and only complaint about the game.  I wish the Millers had spent a little more money to hire some better actors to play these roles, as all three of them are badly overacted.  But, that's a minor gripe.  Altus' acting is so bad, it's actually funny.\nOnce you've played through this game a couple of times, it becomes pretty easy.  However, I still maintain that the game does have a lot of replay value.  Why?  Becuase once you have figured everything out and memorized the solutions to all the puzzles, you can get to the end in about 3 or 4 hours, tops.  But that 3 or 4 hours is time well spent immersed in the game's beautiful environment.\nI've noticed several people who have mentioned that the game does not run well on Windows 98.  I've encountered this problem too.  If you install the game from the automatic installation dialog box that comes up when you insert the Myst CD, the game will play OK for a little while, but will eventually crash.  However, I was able to find a solution.  If you're running Windows 98 or newer, do NOT install from the dialog box.  Instead, go to the Install subdirectory on the CD, find the \"install.exe\" file there, and click on it to install the game that way.  The installation procedure is slightly different.  You'll know you are doing it the different way when the game installes to a new directory called c:\\myst.  If you use the automatic dialog box, it will install to a different subdirectory.  I installed the game using this alternate procedure, and it has been running fine with Windows 98.  I hope this helps anyone out there experiencing problems.  It would be a shame to miss out on a game as good as this one becuase of operating system problems.","summary":"Great puzzle game!!","unixReviewTime":1010102400,"vote":"12","style":{"Edition:":" Standard","Platform:":" PC"},"image":null}

I have played more puzzle games than I can count in my head and this game has by far the best puzzles of them all.  The graphics, sound, and interaction of this game are stunning.  The way that you have to collect information from every available source to solve a puzzle makes the game extraordinary (many puzzle games do not work that way).\nOne aspect of the puzzles in this game that makes it different from many other games is that you cannot guess to solve a puzzle.

Once I found this for a decent price of 5 bucks, I immediately clicked buy, and boy am I glad I did. Now I have never tried out 4-player co-op completely, but I have actually plugged in 4 controllers and it looks amazing. Now I know some people have said never to try this because of \"Blurred graphics and limited view,\" but I don't care! All I care about in a game is gameplay, sound, controls, multiplayer, and music. The controls I had to get used to, but it wasn't horrible or impossible. The sound effects are awesome and the music is also better than the PC version. The game does have difficult puzzles but they are not impossible and the enemies are really awesome. I have played co-op and deathmatch with 2 players and I can say that  the game has amazing multiplayer.

This took me forever! I couldn't get it right even though I thought I remembered it. It truly tests your mind.

The graphic improved drastically, meaning whatever computer you were running the original Myst in '93\/'94 (Myst first appeared on the Mac in '93, then the PC the following year) would probably not be adequate to run Riven. Certainly Myst had made even greater improvements in the graphics department since Riven, like the 360 degree panning feature for Myst III: Exile, and even more photo-realistic graphics and animation for Myst IV: Revelation, but even for 1997 standards the graphics to Riven still hold up, although it's rather obvious the graphics looks a little more pixelated during some of the animated scenes (like when you take a ride on the cable car, probably to keep the animation fast without slowing it down for the computers of the time). But for the most part, the graphics seem so realistic you almost feel like you're there. Of course the big pain is this game consisted of 5 CD-ROM discs, which you have to swap every now and then, it's too bad they didn't have an install feature where you could install all five discs on to hard drive and only need to use one disc to play the game (like the much maligned Schizm: Mysterious Journey, a game from Poland that's very much like Myst, which had five discs in the CD-ROM version, and you had the option for full install so you didn't have to keep swapping discs).\n\nIt's agreed by most everyone that Riven is more difficult to solve than the original Myst. The puzzles often don't seem obvious, and there are some puzzles that can be frustrating, like the marble puzzle, which you have to solve in order to gain access to the domes found on Riven. Or the animal puzzle, which you'll find a bunch of stones in this one room with animal symbols that you have to push in the right order to go to another world. On the original Myst, after you won it, Atrus tells you that his wife Catherine has been taken prisoner, and on Riven, you're supposed to find and free his wife, taken prisoner by Atrus' father, Gehn. Also it looks like a different guy was playing Atrus on Riven from the original Myst, in fact it was none other than Myst creator Rand Miller who plays Atrus on Riven (as well as Myst III and IV, though I hadn't played Myst V, so I can't tell you about the game or the characters), although I'm uncertain who played Atrus on the original Myst. I really love the ambient music that goes with this, not to mention the beautiful scenery found throughout.\n\nAlthough a bit tricky in places, you're certain to enjoy this game if you're in to Myst.","summary":"Second great installment in the Myst saga","unixReviewTime":1148688000,"vote":"3","style":{"Edition:":" Standard","Platform:":" PC\/Mac"},"image":null}

But \"Riven\" more than met that task.  In fact, \"Riven\" so surpasses \"Myst\" in scope, storyline and task that it's almost boggling.\nThe game opens with you returning to D'Ni again after transporting through the linking book in the Library on Myst Island.  The ever-knowledgeable Atrus, played by Rand Miller, thanks you for coming back and says he needs your help.  And from then the race is on: You need to find his wife Catherine who is trapped in a prison somewhere on the Riven Age.  Her captor turns out to be Atrus' father, Gehn, a madman who wants to destroy his own son.  Along the way, you encounter people, puzzles, awesome creatures (like Sunners and Wahrks), and dazzling special effects.\nJust like on Myst Island, the clues you discover on the five islands in Riven are what reveal the story to you.  \"Riven\" is increasingly more complex than \"Myst\" in that regard.  Everything is just bigger and, in my opinion, better.  The graphics have improved tremendously; the Quicktime videos used for all the animations in the game are improved; the puzzles are harder and are more integrated into the storyline than ever before; and there is actually character interaction in this game - much more so than simply meeting people through Prison Books, like in \"Myst.\"\n\"Riven\" is definitely habit-forming.  The first time I played it, I ended up just walking around and looking at everything before I decided to actually begin my journey on rescuing Catherine.  When you step out into the open a few minutes after the real action begins, the sense of \"this is gonna be bigger and more immersive than Myst\" sets in.\nI cannot say enough positive things about \"Riven.\"  I end up playing it more than \"Myst\" and have sometimes preferred it over \"Myst III: Exile.\"  To say I am fascinated with everything on those five islands is an understatement.  I sometimes with I could actually go to the Riven Age and explore; that's how seriously disturbed I really am!\nIn short, if you love the \"Myst Phenomenon,\" get \"Riven.\"  \"Riven\" improves upon pretty much everything that made \"Myst\" such an awesome success.

Myst was a land where you realized that two brothers had done something and  were trapped in books for their efforts.

Graphics that are fantastically detailed, intricate, and achingly beautiful.  Some astonishing joy rides.  Sound effects and music approach perfection.\n2.  Gameplay is wonderfully balanced.  You are never bored, and only occasionally frustrated by the harder puzzles.  All the  puzzles are logical, and give you a great feeling of accomplishment when  you solve them.  There is a vast area to explore while you are figuring  things out.  You turn a corner, and startle mysterious creatures who are  sunning themselves on a rock.  You climb up another path, turn, and the  view makes you gasp.\n3.  Riven creates a fantasy world that is alien; yet  it evokes a sense of reality that is, in my experience, unparalleled in  computer gaming.  I wish I could find a way to live in Riven.\nCons:\n1.  If you like exploring new worlds by dashing through them and shooting  things, you may find that the pace of this particular game is too  slow.\n2.  While the storyline is intriguing, it is possible to nearly  finish Riven before discovering the diaries that further explain the plot.  I wish I had known more of the background of the story a little sooner in  the game.\n3.  Riven is so immersive that you forget the everyday world.  Your children will wonder why you haven't cooked dinner.  Your friends will  speculate as to why you have stopped answering the phone.  Your spouse will  become jealous of your relationship with a computer game (easiest solution:  play it together).\nBottom Line:  IMHO, this game is IT, the Numero Uno,  the King.  Nobody's made one better.","summary":"Simply the Best","unixReviewTime":949795200,"vote":"33","style":{"Edition:":" Standard","Platform:":" PC\/Mac"},"image":null}

This game introduced the DUALSHOCK analog controls for the original PlayStation. It offered much more control in a 3D space than anything else at the time. Plus, you get all these amazing gadgets to catch monkeys! The monkeys have obtained these helmets that cause them to act out in ways not normal for primates. Its your mission to utilize your skills and gadgets to get them all back to the lab to restore order to the world. The core gameplay is surprisingly fun and you use the gadgets directionally with the right analog stick. This makes the method to catching each monkey unique. It also featured an awesome unlock system if you explored the game world enough and found the Specter coins. You could use the coins to buy mini games to play when you're tired of looking for them darn monkeys. The voice acting isn't perfect, but what PS1 games touted the most amazing voice acting you've ever heard? The graphics are very good for the PlayStation, very colorful and bright with a surprising amount of detail gone into all the different levels with varying themes. This game was created by none other than the legendary Sony Japan Studio behind so many other unique and iconic games. It had direct involvement with Shuhei Yoshida himself! This is truly a classic in the PlayStation library that should be experienced by anyone who considers themselves a fan of platformer\/action\/adventure games.

I've been a fan of Crash Bandicoot, and actually it was that series that compelled me to choose a PlayStation over a Saturn (thank goodness), so I quickly became of fan of platforming games. Not to mention that I loved Super Mario 64, but, since I didn't own an N64, I was forced to play it only when I visited my cousin's.\nOne day, while browsing my local Blockbuster, my sister saw a cover with monkeys on it. With that and Rugrats, she checked out the counter with my selections, and we went home that day to play games. I don't remember what games I checked out (FFIX?), but Ape Escape was the one title we played together until we had to return it.\n\nHer following birthday, I bought it for her. You may think, \"Oh, that's nice,\" but I bought it because I actually wanted to play it...\n\nIt was the first game I've ever completed in its entirety, and I go back from time to time to replay it, no matter how many times I've caught the monkeys. The sequels are good, but this stands out as the first game to fully require the DualShock controller, and the music in this installment is my favorite in the series.\n\nMonkeys have taken over different periods of history, and so it's your job to catch them all and bring down the leader. You get helpful gadgetry along the way, and they're all extremely useful and you'll find yourself using them all to the very end. Sometimes some games give you arsenals that become obsolete a few levels later; not here. Every level can use all your tools.\n\nThe boss fights are sparse, but the final boss more than makes up for it. It remains one of my most favorite boss battles, though, by today's standards, it's pretty easy.\n\nI write this review only a couple weeks after my latest playthrough, and the game still holds up extremely well. I thought that, with my years of gaming experience, catching the monkeys would be a lot easier. While I know most of the game's secrets, and the easier levels were far easier than before, the monkeys still prove a challenge to capture. The patterns for boss fights are easy to get down, and I experienced no degradation in my original copy of the game when playing on a PS3.\n\nThis game should be a requirement for all PlayStation owners.","summary":"One of the best platforms on any system.","unixReviewTime":1391990400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Its one of those game thats old, but never got boring even when I played it multiple times. For those who are new to the series, you might think its just running up to monkeys and catching them with a net. You're partially right. If you go into this game and try to catch every monkey by just running up to them with your net, you will get a game over fast. I own the other 2 games in the Ape Escape series and played them multiple times, so its safe for me to say that Ape Escape 1 is the hardest of the series. Let me go into a little more detail.\n\nA little background: I'm not sure about other consoles at the time, but the PS1, unlike todays Sony consoles, had a different control scheme. Instead of using the analogue sticks to move your camera and control your character, you used the arrow buttons. The analogue sticks didn't have much use. Actually with some games no use at all. In other games like Spyro the Dragon you had the option to turn them on, but for some of those games it was glitchy. Ape Escape prooved revolutionary in that it was the first PS1 game to solely use analogue controls and I'm happy it did. I think Ape Escape is the best moving ps1 game I have ever played due to analogue controls. It makes controlling your character and changing camera angles way easier than most games at the time. Now all games use this control scheme for the better.\n\nStory summary: 2 boys, Spike and Jake, are heading to the Professor's laboritory to try out his time machine, but once they get there they find the professor and his assistant\/granddaughter Natalie tied up by a horde of monkeys. The monkeys leader (Spector) has gotten hold of one of the professors inventions called the peak point helmet which increases Spectors intellegents and helps him achieve an insane level of power. The other monkeys possess Monkey helmets that do pretty much the same thing as Spectors helmet, but less powerful. Spctor sends himself and the other monkeys through time so they can change history in a way that'll make monkeys the dominant creatures of the earth and humans basically nonexistant. Its up to Spike to capture these monkeys, including Spector. I know its not the deepest story, but its really amusing and fun getting to travel through time through the dinosaur age up to the future. Later on in the game I actually found it compelling. You also really grow to love Spike by the time you finish the game. I understand now, why alot of people who play the sequals wish Spike was the main character again.\n\nGameplay elements and monkeys: Once again you catch monkeys, but its easier said than done. The first 3 levels are pretty easy, but by level 4 you will be introducesd by some of the harder and more hair pulling to catch monkeys in the game. The task of catching the monkeys is made harder by the fact that you have natural level enemies to worry about while chasing the monkeys down, like Man eating plants and annoying bees. I also have to mention that alot of monkeys are PACKING HEAT! Laser guns, bombs, machine gun, HOLLYCOW! Don't get me started on the red pants monkeys later on who carry almost all these weapons as well as have extremely powerful scratch attacks that you can rarely avoid. There are different kinds of monkeys. I'll just summarize what they do. Monkeys with light blue pants are wimpy and easy to catch. Monkeys with dark blue pants are fast little monsters and require patients to get. Yellow pants monkeys are the most common and have normal difficulty. Green pant monkeys carry missiles on their back and require stealth to get because their sensitive to movement. White pants monkeys sense you easilly and are hard to sneak up on (understatement. Impossible unless someone says other wise). Black pant monkeys carry oozies\/machine guns. I have to note the black pant monkeys are way harder to catch than the ones in the newer games. Then you have the abominations called red pant monkeys. Good lord do my heart stop when I have to catch one of these little bastards. Catching monkeys takes alot of patients and strategy because as you've already guessed from my description of them, they are hard to catch. Throughout the game you are given multiple inventions from the professor that are essential to catching certain monkeys in earlier levels that couldn't be caught before. Every invention is important in some shape or form and will either make a monkey easier to catch or harder, depending on the strategy used. The inventions are way better than the ones they give you in the other games. Some of the inventions in the other games are just plain useless. You also have lives in this game that you gain by collecting 100 gold arrows or a jacket. I've had more game overs in this one then any of the other two.\n\nLevels: The levels are divided by eras (the whole travel through time element). For example: Im in the dinosaur era and I play 3 levels from this era one after the other (unlock them), catch the required number of monkeys, then leave, unlocking a new era with 3 more levels (Hope that explains it good). Each level is unique and different which makes everything feel fresh and that much more awesome.\n\nMusic: OMG! Ape Escape has one of my favorite videogame soundtracks of all time. Not since Donkey Kong Country 2 have I entered levels just to pause and listen to the music. Ape Escape prooves music is a very important part of a videogame. The music excites you and is very enjoyable. It has the best track of the entire series and its ashame Ape Escape 2 suffers from its bland soundtrack. In Ape Escape 3 the music is reminiscent of the first one, so I think the makers learned from their mistake. My favorite tracks are Crumbling Castle, Dark Ruins, Galaxy Monkey, The Spector theme, and a few others, but the soundtrack of the whole game is just epic and fills my heart with nostalgia and joy everytime I hear one of them. It's underrated and I wish more people knew about it.\n\nReplayabillity: Compared to the other games, Ape Escape 1 doesn't have much replayabilty, unless you're like me and love it so much you just start a new game all the time. Throughout the levels there are Spector coins you pick up. the coins are used to unlock 3 minigames in the time station. My favorite of these is galaxy monkey. The other two are meh. I really wish they had a way for you to unlock the soundtrack like the other two games. That would have been awesome.\n\nI've gone down memory lane long enough. The sad part is I still have my old Ape Escape game, but it no longer works anymore. I'm definately buying it off amazon. I wish instead of porting Ape Escape to the PSP, they would have ported it to the PS2, with an soundtrack unlockable available. Given that attention is mostly put on the PS3 and other next gen consoles\/games nowadays I don't see a port happening soon (the PS3 doesn't even play older games according to some people I've asked). Ape Escape is definately worth buying.","summary":"One of my favorite games of all time.","unixReviewTime":1309910400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

You catch a few slow monkeys and learn your gadgets thru tutorials.  But then it gets difficult.  My 3 year old daughter loves to sit on the bed with spare control in hand and help catch monkeys.  The graphics are nice and the storyline is fun.  The gadgets are cool too.\nOnly one complaint, and that is that the camera angle loves to change when you are at the most challenging parts.  Anytime you need to use your flying thingy and it's for going somewhere difficult, the camera changes and you can't see where your destination is.  It gets a bit annoying after you die a few times, but I did eventually get past the frustration and finished the game.

Who wouldn't want to save babes while bustin in a movie theater shooting alien scum all over the place? Pig cop with a shotgun? Introduce him, to your grenade launcher, BattleLord giving you a hard time??? throw him a pipe bomb party! Your options of fighting opponents are endless with dukes arsenal of guns ranging from shotguns, sub machine guns, grenade launchers, missle launchers all the way to trip mines(great in multiplayer), and shrink guns which allows you to shrink your opponents and crush like a bug with your 15 size boot. The guns are the best yet in an fps. The gameplay is hot as well, your environment is your playground, use toilets, blow up toilets, bust open a movie screen in the theatres, discover cool secrets by blowing open walls, PLAY POOL, the list goes on. Bust open aliens as you make your way saving babes, searching for key cards, finding hot new weapons, and having one helluva time. Do you have what it takes to save earth from aliens, can duke save his babes before aliens use them for mass production (weird, I know), always bet on Duke.

This is a succesfull mix that results in a lot of fun.\n\nFor most of the game you play as Tarzan, as a adult and as a kid, Terk in the camp level, and the amusing Jane sequence.  The graphics are very good, capturing the spirit of a jungle, with lots of creatures wondering around, light from treetops and lots more.  Disney has always been good in delivering great music that is enjoyable all by itself and Tarzan is no diffrent, with bongos, drums and the themes from the movie.\n\nThe 3 challenge levels give you a taste of difficulty and a different ending for each one.  The levels are also very cool and neat to play through.\n\nUnfortunity Tarzan suffers from some serious problems.  I pretty much gaurantee that you will get very annoyed by the jungle creatures that will try to kill you on your quest for manhood and survival, especially the stupid birds that bombard you with coconuts, and yet, you can never kill them!  What's up with that?!\n\nThe monkeys are also very annoying  Also, some of the moves can be difficult for young kids to pull off.  The final two levels are really difficult to defeat, and defeating the evil Clayton is really difficult.\n\nOverall, Tarzan is a good game that no one should pass up, especially if they want sidescrolling action.\n\nThe good: Great graphics, nice jungle themes, great music.\n\nThe bad: Creatures can get VERY annoying\n\nAnd the ugly: Can be really difficult at times","summary":"Tarzan like game!","unixReviewTime":1000425600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Final Fantasy VII...\n...is\n...NOT...\n...overrated.\n\nStay with me for a minute though. That's not to say the game is perfect. Final Fantasy VII is not the Citizen Kane of video games. There are games out there with better stories and better characters. And in terms of gameplay, it's certainly not the best JRPG ever made, either. One could argue that the party size's reduction from four to three members streamlines the battle system, but a pessimist (or purist) might call it a detrimental simplification. After all, the last time a Final Fantasy game made the leap to a new, more powerful platform (Final Fantasy IV), they increased the party size and introduced the ATB mechanic. The only thing this game's battle system introduces are Limit Breaks, and those aren't even really new. The Materia system is a dumbed-down retooling of Final Fantasy VI's Magicite\/Relic setup, and helps to make Final Fantasy VII the only installment aside from III to make differences between party members virtually nonexistent. In the first and fourth games, characters were set apart by the skills and attributes tied to their classes, which could sometimes be upgraded but never changed. Party members in the second and fifth installments start out virtually identical, but gradually evolved into distinct characters with exclusive capabilities as the game commences. Final Fantasy VI combines these two approaches by pairing set character classes with Magicite and Relics. In Final Fantasy VII, however, Limit Breaks are the ONLY major difference between characters, and with a few exceptions, most of them do the same thing.\n\nBut as I was saying, Final Fantasy VII is NOT OVERRATED. But it IS over-hyped, and often for the wrong reasons.\n\nMy initial impression of Final Fantasy VII was slack-jawed stupefaction at how incredible it looked. Today's gamers who are accustomed to BioShock, Odin Sphere, and HDTV consoles with 1080p or 4K display might scoff at the comparatively blocky and clunky graphics of Final Fantasy VII's iconic opening FMV. But in 1997-- back when FMV itself was still a novelty and kind of a big deal-- the general reception of the first two minutes of Final Fantasy VII was eye-popping astonishment. I can almost guarantee that anybody who played Final Fantasy VII when it was first released-- even people who bash it now, as FFVII-deprecation becomes more and more in vogue with the upcoming PS4 remake-- was shocked into silence during the game's first half-hour. Even if their interest tapered off further into the game, I don't think many players can honestly say the their first hectic glimpse into Final Fantasy VII's world didn't knock them off their feet. If Final Fantasy IV's dynamic opening sequence was pretty impressive to players who grew up with the series 8-bit iterations, Final Fantasy VII's introduction was nothing short of mind-blowing.\n\nBefore moving on with the graphics, let's examine what most people consider the games' greatest narrative strength (and why they're incorrect).\n\n~THE CAST~\nThe game centers largely around a group called AVALANCHE (yes, it's officially spelled with capital letters, and no, nobody knows what it's supposed to be an acronym for) which was originally a terroristic cabal founded and led by Barret to combat the global energy conglomerate Shinra, Inc. After undergoing a drastic roster change and getting drawn into the events regarding Shinra, Sephiroth, and the search for the fabled Promised Land, AVALANCHE changes its mission. In addition to saving the planet from Shinra's economic stranglehold and planetary life essence-sucking Mako reactors, it is resolved to find Sephiroth and put a stop to his mysterious designs, at which point the leadership reins are passed from Barret to the main character, Cloud.\n\nCloud Strife is one of the most recognizable faces in video games today, in addition to wielding one of video games' most iconic weapons. He is also a snarky jerk, certifiably insane, and, in true JRPG protagonist fashion, is better than everyone else in the world at everything, including snowboarding, chocobo riding, and sustaining multiple shotgun blasts to the face. Even with a more mature perspective, I still can't help liking Cloud. He remains consistently interesting all the way up to Act 3, which is about when he loses the attitude, sorts out his mental luggage, and become another vanilla JRPG hero. The big revelation regarding his identity in Act 2 is right on par with FFVI villain Kefka and his apocalyptic hijinks as one of the most genuinely shocking twists in a video game narrative.\n\nBarret Wallace, the original leader of Final Fantasy VII's most notorious terrorist group, is portrayed with a boisterous, short-tempered disposition that often comes just short of racial caricature. It also doesn't really help that he's constantly outdone by everyone's favorite spiky-headed Aryan every five minutes. All things considered, he's treated pretty fairly when compared to someone like Sazh from FFXIII, and remains one of the most likeable characters in the game. He's more human than Cloud, less whiny than Vincent, and not as much of a misogynistic bastard as Cid.\n\nThe other initial AVALANCHE member is Tifa Lockhart, Cloud's childhood pal, expert martial artist, and Midgar bar hostess. She spends most of Act 1 pulling on Cloud's left arm, trying to wrench him away from Aerith, who has him by his right. She bothers me today for the same reason I don't fancy Celes in FFVI the same way I used to. For the greatest martial artist on the planet, Tifa proves totally incapable of taking care of herself when Cloud isn't around. There's a scene in Act 2 in which Barret chides her for falling completely apart over Cloud's absence. I appreciated that line as something of a little self-aware nod the game made about itself. But then I remembered in Act 3 how Tifa spouted the exact same line as Rosa did back in Final Fantasy IV: \"I WILL REMAIN BY YOUR SIDE BECAUSE NOTHING BAD CAN HAPPEN TO ME WHEN I'M WITH YOU!!\" And then I cringe.\n\nJoining them is Aerith Gainsborough, best know for being the Final Fantasy chick who dies. Aerith is a flower girl from the slums who also happens to be the very last of the Ancients-- until she is murdered by Sephiroth. Though she is fully dedicated to AVALANCHE's new cause, Aerith seems a lot more interested in her passive-aggressive duel with Tifa for Cloud's affections, which she loses by default when she dies. Her affection for Cloud party stems from his peculiar resemblance to her old boyfriend Zack, who is dead, just like Aerith is by the end of the first disc. Unfortunately, Aerith never finds out the full story behind Cloud and Zack, because Sephiroth runs his sword through her guts before it comes to light. Before she dies, Aerith sets a plot device in motion that becomes the Planet's only hope for stopping Meteor. And then she dies.\n\n(The previous paragraph may have contained minor spoilers, by the way.)\n\nThe rest of the cast isn't nearly as extensively developed as other reviews would have you believed. Red XIII's only real function in the plot is to get the party to Cosmo Canyon, and I'm willing to be Square created him almost entirely as an excuse to demonstrate that their new 3D modeling witchery could be used to make all kinds of new player characters possible. Cait Sith barely contributes any more than Red XIII does (Can someone explain to me what exactly is supposed to be happening to him in the Temple of the Ancients? Did he somehow gain sentience, or are we seeing Reeve get a little too wrapped up in his performance?). Cid is a criminally underused character whose only real purpose is to allow the party access to the airship (god I wish his stint as team leader in Act 2 lasted longer). Depending upon who you ask, Yuffie is either an adorable little scamp, or the most obnoxious brat ever attached to an HP bar, who stars in one single interesting world-building sidequest. And I should probably mention that I have never played Dirge of Cerberus so I have no idea what it has to say regarding Vincent's backstory. But if it isn't revealed within Final Fantasy VII-- as this game was originally conceived to be a totally self-contained story-- then as far as I'm concerned it is irrelevant.\n\nOne of the biggest problems I have regarding this game is the primary antagonist, Sephiroth, the most overrated video game character ever-- but I'm jumping the gun. He was once Shinra's top-ranking operative and probably the single most dangerous man on the Planet, who seemed content to dutifully carry out his orders. Two years before the start of the game, events during a routine mission made him question his own origins. He read into it, didn't like what he found, and went insane. At first he sounds like he's sporting an Oedipus complex for his \"mother\", Jenova, whom the reports he uncovers incorrectly identify as an Ancient. Believing himself to be Ancients' heir, Sephiroth resolves to travel with her to the Promised Land and make humanity pay for squandering the Planet the Ancients passed on to them. But sometime between then and the start of the game he abandons the whole \"Mother!\" shtick, forgets about the Ancients and the Promised Land, and decides he wants to become a god by dropping a giant rock on the world and absorbing the energy gathered by the planet to heal its wound. Why the change of heart? NOBODY KNOWS!\n\nNo one knows what his motives are. He spends the entire game frozen in a crystal while his black-coat flunkies and Jenova's severed pieces do everything for him. He rips off Kefka's fallen angel performance. And not to sound even more nitpicky, but wasn't his plan to be at the center of the planet's Meteor-inflicted wound, because that's where the energy will be gathering? Meteor is hovering over Midgar. Sephiroth is stuck underground in a crystal at the north pole. Is this a tremendous oversight on Sephiroth's part, or does he have some other power I'm not aware of because the game never bothered telling me? Ambiguity is one thing, plot inconsistencies are another. You should not have to consult the Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Omega Guide and\/or retconning DVD releases to have this stuff clarified.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that this game wasted a truly engaging and frightening antagonist in Jenova in favor of this guy. Even though Jenova is the single most important figure in the story she ends up playing second fiddle to a pretty boy in a black cape. Maybe it's just the Lovecraft fan in me, but an ancient cosmic being whose undying cells can eventually reunite and bring it back to life, and who can manipulate humans to its own insidious, unfathomable ends by projecting illusions and false memories into their minds seems like a much more deserving of the \"primary antagonist\" designation than Norman Bates with prettier hair and a longer knife.\n\nBut moving on...\n\n~LOCATIONS~\nFinal Fantasy VII's character models, overworld map, and battle scenes are now three-dimensional, but the series hasn't fully made the leap into 3D just yet. The town and dungeon maps may no longer be made up of flat, tiled grids, but they're all still two-dimensional. The 32-bit Final Fantasy games are unique for their pre-rendered environments. Whereas the 8- and 16-bit games' environments were confined to tilesets and the more recent installments are still limited to a finite number of textures and skins that can be displayed at once, the only limitations on the PlayStation-era games' environments were what could be produced with a pen and the artists imagination.\n\nThe greatest narrative strength of Final Fantasy VII isn't its characters or plot. It's the SETTING. The player might be controlling Cloud, whom the game's events revolve around, but more often than not Cloud is just a tiny purple and yellow speck on the screen as he makes his way through a gigantic Mako reactor or trudges through a sweeping stretch of wilderness. The Planet itself is Final Fantasy VII's star, thrust into the center stage by the game's immense beautifully-rendered environments.\n\nHere's a list of-- in this fan's humble opinion-- the game's seven more memorable locations. #1 should come as a surprise to absolutely nobody.\n\n7.) The Great Glacier\nThe largest \"dungeon\" in the game (this place is HUGE), and the farthest away from Midgar Final Fantasy VII takes you before handing you an airship and making you revisit the places you've already been. Barret, likely delirious from hypothermia, goes off on a tangent about how the northern tundra is like the antithesis of Midgar, and I think he's on to something. The path of Cloud's journey to find Sephiroth begins in a place that has been totally co-opted by humanity, and ends here: in a pristine wilderness completely under nature's domain, where humans are incapable of sustaining themselves for long. I guess the message here is that what's most desirable is a middle ground between the two.\n\n6.) Cosmo Canyon\nAh, hello there middle ground. I'd guess Cosmo Canyon is more than a little derived from an idealized portrait of the American Southwest and its indigenous peoples. But in any case, it's what every commune wishes it could be, and in all honesty, it's where I'd be posting this from if it actually existed. The jolly and wise Bugenhagen most represents the place's spirit: humanity, nature, and technology existing in balance.\n\n5.) Wutai\nForced to disarm after its humiliating defeat in a war with Shinra fifteen years ago, Wutai now peddles its ancient and unique culture to tourists from the very lands that defeated them. It is a land of many deities, but most of its inhabitants no longer believe in them as strongly than they used to. Much generation friction exists in Wutai over the war and adherence to custom and tradition. Wutai is also full of pagodas, ninja, and giant Buddha statues. If you haven't already guessed that this place is an almost perfect analogue to Japan (and most of Southeast Asia), well...\n\n4.) Nibleheim\nCloud and Tifa's hometown seems more like the setting of a psychological horror film than a JRPG village. Nibelheim is where you'd end up if you took a wrong exit while driving to Silent Hill. It's the backdrop for Final Fantasy VII's most disturbing events and lies at the very core of Cloud's delusions. Even scarier is the notion that somebody could watch their neighborhood burning and their friends and family slaughtered, then come back two years later to find everything standing exactly as it was before, populated by strangers who insist nothing ever happened.\n\n3.) The Forgotten City\nIn keeping with the H.P. Lovecraft references, this place is hugely reminiscent of At the Mountains of Madness and The Shadow Out of Time. The utterly alien City of the Ancients is deserted, bewildering, and more than a little unnerving in its strangeness (a quality enhanced by its ominous exclusive BGM). This place is a cornucopia of mystery, and everyone who might have been capable of unlocking all its secrets is dead. The Forgotten City has a kind of eldritch beauty about it that makes you glad to depart and reluctant to return. Even modern 128-bit games have trouble being this atmospheric.\n\n2.) The Gold Saucer\nGlitzy and gimmicky, often cheesy, and always expensive, the Gold Saucer is Final Fantasy VII's Disneyland. There isn't a Square fan on the planet who can't identify the Gold Saucer theme within three notes, as most of them have spent more hours here than anywhere else in the game. It was awfully considerate of Square to consolidate virtually all of Final Fantasy VII's minigames and endgame sidequests into one (semi-) convenient location. It is curious, though, how the Planet's premier playground for rich people is located right above its largest prison and can only be reached by first passing through the world's most poorest and most destitute region. Some sort of masked commentary, perhaps, or just a coincidence?\n\n1.) Midgar\nI said you wouldn't be surprised. Midgar IS Final Fantasy VII. It's as much a cyberpunk's idealized city as Blade Runner's Los Angeles, only Blade Runner doesn't give you the freedom to explore the city on your own. When most people discuss what they remember or enjoy most about Final Fantasy VII, the answer more often than not pertains to Midgar. It's also no coincidence that the game gradually becomes less engaging as you are lead farther and farther away from the city, then picks up again once the party leaves the Northern Crater and starts getting drawn back towards it.\n\nMost pre-1997 console RPGs and adventure games' prevalent themes were along the lines of \"power of hope, love and friendship\", \"absolute power corrupts\", \"elemental\" crystals, mystical jewels, and\/or mana seeds are best left alone\", with the occasional, \"hey, don't trust Christianity.\" Most of these games took place in medieval storybook lands inhabited by elves, knights, fairies, dragons, princesses, and talking trees, and their stories were usually about a small band of misfits defeating an evil wizard or king so the world could live happily ever after and abolish all wars forever. Then we get to the PlayStation era. Final Fantasy VII might not quite be that generation's \"Great Gatsby\", but it captures turn-of-the-century Zeitgeist like no previous game could and which few games have been able to surpass.\n\nEvil empires are a mainstay of RPGs and adventure games. To most gamers, they are things of the distant past. So Final Fantasy VII gives us Shinra, a mega-conglomerate that has dominated the world's market to such an overwhelming degree that it has become the Planet's most influential entity. Shinra is technically nothing more than a business firm operating in (what appears to be) a capitalist system, and yet it has grown so powerful that it has superseded the government of the country in which it has based, takes over other cities (like Junon), and even maintains its own military force. I'll assume you are able to connect the dystopic dots yourself. The themes of this company carry through the rest of the game. Not only does it come complete with it's own evil castle in the form of a corporate high-rise office building, but it's rare to pass a town that doesn't have it's own Mako reactor, indicating that Shinra has the world's energy market in a ball-grip. The parallel's between real-life oil companies on planet Earth are too strong to ignore.\n\nJRPGs and other video games have had environmental messages before (Global Gladiators, anyone?), but Final Fantasy VII is a hardliner on the issue. Bugenhagen explains that the purpose of the White Materia and Holy is to induce the Planet to purge itself of anything threatening it. This not only means it will repel Meteor, but a very real possibility exists that humanity will be erased in the process. I'm used to hearing poets and environmentalists tell me that the world would be glad to see us gone, but this is some pretty heavy stuff coming from a video game.\n\nOne of Final Fantasy VII's outspoken messages is that a post-industrial society like Midgar's (which isn't such a far cry from the cities of today) is degrading to the human spirit. Midgar is spreading. The blight to the land inflicted by its Mako reactors creeps outwards, and Shinra's economic and technological influence is changing civilization. The old ways of life are dying out as more people adopt Mako technology and conform to Shinra's ways. Meanwhile, back on planet Earth, technology's role in human life continues to grow unchecked, and a whole lot of people are getting concerned about the globalization trend. If there's a point Final Fantasy VII is making somewhere at the heart of its labyrinthine story, it's that such developments are not in people's best interests. Once again, this isn't the kind of statement you'd expect from a video game back in 1997, especially coming from the folks whose company name you probably last saw stamped on Secret of Evermore and Super Mario RPG.\n\nAll of this and I've hardly gone over the gameplay at all. What is there to say? Its battle and party development mechanics are fun, even if sometimes a little too simple. The thing is, thanks to the PlayStation's better hardware and new format, Final Fantasy VII offers a much more multifaceted experience than its predecessors-- an experience whose ATB battles and character maintenance are overshadowed by its other aspects. Final Fantasy VI performed a successful balancing act between gameplay and narrative, even if the scales occasionally tipped more towards narrative. If the last Final Fantasy on the SNES marked a change in direction, then Final Fantasy VII was a wild sprint in that new direction. It builds on much of what made VI successful, but somewhere along the line, the balance was totally thrown off. Final Fantasy VII is about narrative. The battles are fun, but they are certainly not what sold over 11 million copies.\n\nI don't think Final Fantasy VII is overrated. Almost twenty years later, it's still the game every JRPG tries to be. It actually broke the genre. It now exists as a standard that cannot possibly be met. The next successful JRPG will be the one that manages to break as much ground, sell as many copies, and stir up as much of a popular and critical tidal, and that's about as likely as Street Fighter V resurrecting the American arcade scene. In other words, at our current trend it's probably never going to happen.\n\nIgnore the hype. Final Fantasy VII isn't perfect. Don't expect perfection, because you shouldn't anyway. For better or worse, this is one of the titles that helped push video games into their current identity crisis. It was a forward stride in the evolution of a genre and a medium, and the next step will occur when the genre is able to get past it.\n\nSo, Final Fantasy VII gets a perfect score. For all its imperfections and hype, it offers too memorable and inimitable a trip to deserve anything less.","summary":"This game is not overrated.","unixReviewTime":1472947200,"vote":"2","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

The villain, Sephiroth,  is definitely a highlight. He's like Darth Vader, and at the end of the game, you'll want to destroy him so much! The cast is great, and very likable, They all have a moment in the story where there is some really good character development. The graphics haven't aged the best, and it is very blocky in some cases. it can look very dated. But, as you go on, it gets pretty charming and you enjoy it. The FMVs are fine, and some cases are hilarious. The gameplay is very well done. It's a turn-based RPG, but it does require a lot of skill. There's a time bar that charges, and as it's done, you can act. Enemies won't wait for you, but they also much charge. Limit breaks will charge as you take damage, and they are attacks that do insane damage. You can equip material, which gives you magic, stat increases, or even new commands. The combat is a ton of fun, and super enjoyable. Final Fantasy 7 is a great time no matter what, and I think everybody should give it a try!

This game has gone on to be without a doubt the most popular final fantasy game if not the most popular jrpg game ever made, and with good reason.\n\nIf I had any complaints about this game its the fact that the graphics while amazing back in 1997 look a bit dated in 2014 which while some of the other final fantasys might look a little jagged around the edges but the have aged better. Which isn't the games fought or nothing given that company's where still getting the foot on the ground in the whole 3d fad in 1997, but it might turn off other players. Everyone kinda has a legoie look to them. In the battle scenes however are really detailed and graphically hold up today. Now for the music 90% of the games soundtrack is amazing for a psx game its highly catchy and without the music I doubt the game would have been quite as popular as it is today. With that being said there is a few tracks in the game that are hard to listen to but most of it is great.\n\nOf Coarse the important part about final fantasy is the story and game play. The story without giving out any spoilers for the few that haven't played it yet, in this game is probably the best we will be able to see in a video game (besides final fantasy 6 and maybe star wars knights of the old republic). What I like about the earlier final fantasy games is that its kinda like reading a book only that your playing and immersed into it. So with that being said I actually preferred this over the newer ones with the voice acting. If your a younger gamer or have kids the may have a hard time getting into a final fantasy game until the have reached the age the can read and perhaps this game can even help them learn or want to learn how to read. Also for newcomers of the series you do not need to play any of the previous final fantasy's to understand the story. Most Final Fantasy's with the exception of the ons that have -2 on them have nothing to do with one another story wise other than a few minor references here and there so if you just want to play one final fantasy you are invited to do that.\n\nGame play wise this game is very similar to the previous final fantasys IV-VI with the active time battle. This makes the battles a lot more fun as you can not scroll threw everything all day and get a shower before you make your move. With that being said you do have some time before making a move but you do have to be careful. Anyway this is on of the more easier final fantasys although it is still challenging none of the final fantasys (while maybe 13) are casual friendly and this is no different there is a learning curve however if you don't play games much and are sucked into this on you will learn it eventually. Just might have to start over a time or to.\n\nAnyway believe it or not despite popular believe this is not the best final fantasy game. Now it is on of the best and is the best final fantasy game to get started with since its slightly easier but I would recommend playing threw Final Fantasy VI as well since after beating VII I discovered more games in the series and found that this game was a lot more fun although similar plus the story of that game completely sucks you in even more than VII does. Along with the soundtrack of VI is just as great if not better.\n\nAnyway even though VI is a better game, although a bit more hardcore. VII is still a great follow up for that game and was the game that got me hooked in the series (although I did played the first on on the old nes back in the day) and is on of the best RPGs ever made anyone into rpgs both western and Japanese ones will be happy with this game as long as there willing to sit threw the outdated graphics, they will find a very fun and likable game with great characters (although this is somewhat where final fantasy started going to stereotypical anime people) and a great story.","summary":"amazing classic game","unixReviewTime":1404345600,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

One who cannot understand the complexity, maturity, imagination, and heart that went into its story would be the kind to give it a rating of one or even be foolish enough to compare it to Final Fantasy VI.\nOkay, enough of the overly smug and satirical comments. It is entirely subjective what people think of any Final Fantasy game, but what is objective is that it is the best selling Final Fantasy game to date refer to the following website for further proof if you need a reference: [...]\nThe sales of this game will continue to rise with Steam support, and it is well worth its place in the number one spot. I have tried other Final Fantasy games because of VII and not found them as impressive based on their RPG elements of leveling up materia, upgrading weapons, and limit breaks.\nComparing VII to IX you will be frustrated that if your character goes into trance mode (which is the limit break of VII) just before a different character kills the last remaining enemy, then that is a trance gone wasted. In Final Fantasy VII you can hold on to that limit break until you face the next boss. I understand that VIII does the same, but I cannot stand it's gil earnings system, card mechanics, or even characters. Cloud is a complex and confused character, but he's not a total d*ck like Squall. Aeris is a character you care for immediately, Red XII's personal story involving his father will bring tears to your eyes, Cid's rekindling his view of Shera changes him as a person, even Yuffie's story with her hometown and father is relatable despite the little punk stealing your materia. The way I review games is based on their performance as a game, such as what you find annoying about certain games and how the usual mechanics fair for this one. Without further ado, allow me to break it down objectively.\nCamera: Many games these days suffer camera issues that are downright unbearable, but Final Fantasy VII's camera is always placed in the right overhead area and for some levels at in a nice side scrolling style. You can customize how you want the camera to behave during battle sequences, and you can even control the camera while on the world map. The camera here is perfect with no complaints.\nGraphics: The graphics are not even that of the typical Playstation format, but not in a bad way. It still hangs on to its roots during story sequences, but during the battles they change entirely to appear more anime inspired, and the cutscenes may seem dated are still decent even for today. Its late old school gaming at its best which helps you harken back to when what mattered most was the...\nGameplay: Addicting to say the least. Having trouble putting down the controller until you can leave Midgar? No one is judging you here. The game mechanics are flawless in what they provide in terms of gameplay. Sure, you could always add more, but why fix what isn't broken in this masterpiece? Grinding might seem a little annoying, but it's not about leveling your character up to be twice as strong as the end level boss. The battles are all about strategy, which is understandable why many don't comprehend that. You level up your character, level up materia, swap items, prepare accessories and weapons, earn proper amounts of gil from battles, sell mastered materia, find stronger weapons and armor, mingle with townsfolk, decide how you want to treat an ally, breed and race Chocobos, go on mini side quests, partake in a few hilarious main quests, and all of it feels rewarding. The replayability is on high for this because you can always go back and make different choices in another playthrough, or just relive the story and imagination. One disc wasn't enough to pack such massive gameplay as it required a full three for the mighty Playstation hardware. Don't think you have beaten the game if you haven't beaten Emerald or Ruby WEAPON either. It doesn't end with just Sephiroth.\nStory: This may be the first game where I add story into the review as the story is its own character in the game. Every character has an emotional background, even the optional characters of Vincent and Yuffie. What happens to Aeris is not groundbreaking even for a Final Fantasy game, but her lacking presence is felt as you journey deeper into the Promised Land hoping to thwart Sephiroth at the reunion for what he has done. Yuffie's teen angst is terribly relatable despite her annoying dialogue, and even Red XIII's mistaken view of his father is met with goosebumps. Even the hard shelled Barret has his past come back to haunt him that must be faced. It's stories that are all wrapped up into one incredible story as you journey to save the planet from being destroyed at the hands of a god in the making. Step aside, Kefka, Sephiroth is no laughing matter.\nControls: The controls are completely flawless and perfectly responsive. Any game with perfect controls are completely playable based off that reason alone, but Final Fantasy VII utilized your controls in different ways many times so you gain the most from your experience. You snowboard, defend your allies by motorcycle, ride and race chocobos, fly the greatest airship in the Final Fantasy series, and battle intimidating monsters. Still the controls are a small part of what consists of this legendary game.\nSound: The regular sound effects again take you back to the old school Final Fantasy days, but the music is without incomparable. From when the game first kicks off in Midgar, to when you first meet Aeris, to the excitement of the Gold Saucer, to the dramatic confrontation Red XIII has with what is left of his father, to the final confrontation with Sephiroth. Every tune strikes a chord that will last forever and is ingeniously constructed as well as perfectly fitting. No Final Fantasy game sounds as pleasant, and that isn't based off of just nostalgia. The music is perfect for listening to outside the game with melodies that will bring you back to your first experiences.\nIn conclusion, words do not do this game justice. Play for yourself especially if you need to catch up on classic Final Fantasy games (now that they're going the annoying subscription fee route). Enjoy what brought this series to its success and make Sephiroth pay.","summary":"A Timeless Classic","unixReviewTime":1382313600,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

The characters are special, the graphics were pretty good for its time, the game play was on point and who can really mention Final Fantasy 7 without mentioning the FREAKING MUSIC??! I really love the characters and just about everything else about the game. However, when you mix in the music everything just fit. I think this was the second Final Fantasy title I played after 3. After playing 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, Tactics and the first Tactics Advance game, I must say that this game is still my favorite Final Fantasy. It's spectacular. And while I honestly don't think I could play through the game again today it still holds up as one of the best games I've ever played. Definitely the best RPG game I've ever played. If I hadn't booted it up and played it so much in the past I might feel different about owning it again. However, if you've never played the game (do you live under a rock?!) then it's really a great idea to try it somehow. If you missed it because you were too young\/not born when it came out in '97 then do so.

Because of that simple statement and resident fact, the game has become an absolute joy and cultural icon in the gaming world.  If you've gamed, you've heard about FFVII, if you've played Final Fantasies before, you've most likely been inundated with information about this FF.  Ten to one, you've probably played it.  Over and over and over again.  And for good reason.\n\nIf you're a stickler for graphics, this is not your game.  True, there are patches for the computer version that makes the graphics of the characters a bit more bearable, but half the charm is the ludicrously sharp angles and style that was just pulling out of 16-bit gaming.  The cut scenes, for its time, were remarkable and had blown our young minds away all those years ago.  Now, however, it pales in comparison to what is being put out on next gen software.  Still, if you can look past the blocky animation the game will still blow your mind.\n\nIt's a game that you actually, go figure, have to WORK at.  The easiest route is not always the most accessible and you'll spend a lot of time bashing poor Cloud, the main character, into walls trying to find the damn door.  On top of that, you have to battle beasts that aren't going to level up or down with you to present a challenge.  They are what they are and if you can't beat them you better be ready to run around the world a couple hundred times leveling yourself and your characters.  But, the upside to that is the convenience of crap to do!  There's a whole world of mini games and side quests that take up a majority of your time and energy.  The main story is captivating and you wish to see it to its conclusion, but at the same time Gold Saucer and Chocobo Breeding might very well make you into an addict.  This makes the game, in the later hours, a bit easy to beat since you might very well grab every summon and every materia known to the Planet, which will make your characters into walking, talking nuclear bombs without the fallout.\n\nThe characters are all very rounded and all have a depth of story to them that is very typical of Final Fantasy, but they are not loosely connected by coincidence, but rather a drive to see the world saved.  Their reasons are all unique to them and it makes the story as believable as any since we all know what it's like to be part of a group that stands for something, even if it's something small.  The antagonist is just as round.  Sephiroth is as complicated as the rest and will present quite a challenge to you as you progress through the game.\n\nThere were many breakthroughs with this game that helped to pave the road for future FFs and separate future RPGs, but it makes it no less fun to play because it's so called \"old\" or \"outdated\".  A definite gem, worth the time and effort, and all kinds of fun.","summary":"So Called the \"Best\" for Good Reason","unixReviewTime":1359504000,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

I had may have seen a commercial or two for it, its hard to remember, but I certainly had no intention of playing it.  But one night, I went to rent a few games, it was rent 2 get 1 free, but I didn't realize this.  I got to the counter to pay adn the guy told me about the deal, but there wasn't anything that looked decent to me.  So the guy recomended FF7, I figured why not its free.  After I got bored of the other two games and put it in, my life changed forever.  I was amazed at how bad I wanted to keep playing, never before had a game sucked me in so quickly and so powerfully.  When I saw my first summon, Ifrit, holy crap was I blown away.  Needless to say, i bought it soon after and played it all the way through to include the optional bosses, Emerald and Ruby Weapon.  If you havnt beaten them, you havnt beaten the game by the way.  Sephiroth is a joke compared to those guys.  I have played through it again probably another 3-4 times since because it really is that good.  I wasn't expecting anything when I played it as I didn't even know what it was really, so hype has nothing to do with it being simply fantastic.\n\nFor its time, the graphics were the best i had ever seen.  I cared about all the characters and was very much into the deep and interesting story.  The battle system is still one of the best in my opinion.  I loved all the weapons, the sword designs were just awesome, I drew all of them at school all the time. And the materia customization was wonderful and made you think and plan.  Apparently I was one of the only ones to think of using a limit break and mime it over and over again, at least from what ive gathered talking to other people about it, im sure others have done this. Everyone I talked to was all about \"Knights of the Round\" Summon, Pfffftt.  Never got it, to much time for a 3 min summon. Why bother with a 3 min summon that does roughly 100,000 damage when I can do OmniSlash that takes 15 secs and does 150,000 damage, and can be repeated for free.\n\nI still hope they do a remake of this game with updated graphics, that would make me very happy. Also, if you liked the story of FF7, you should play Crisis Core as its the story right before FF7 and explains ALOT about what happens in 7.","summary":"Unquestionable","unixReviewTime":1335225600,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Furthermore, I was a fan of FF7 way before it got all hyped-up. While FF6 is still my favorite, the sheer magnitude of revolutionary changes that this game brought about, not only for the franchise, but for the industry altogether, make this game well-deserving of its current fan-base, and subsequent prequel and sequel. The story is immersive and fulfilling for those interested in getting into the intricacies of it. The gameplay is original. The RPG aspects are unique. The graphics are tolerable, unless you are a picky, new-age gamer. One must keep in mind that for it's time, the graphics and CGI cut-scenes were extraordinary. This game was the first to introduce the ultimate weapons and super-bosses to the franchise. Although, it is the first to keep them attainable and within reason. No obnoxious grinding or farming necessary to attain victory. Just the classic strategies and game play that make Final Fantasy great.\nAnyone hesitant because of its current status, or its vintage status, or any other reason, should give it a chance. I can assure any respectable gamer that they will be pleasantly surprised by this outstanding title.

It has a great story and some of the best characters ever.  I got so attached to these characters.  I won't get into too much detail because other reviewers already did a good job explaining that, but it truly is a great game.  The graphics are fine for an old game, and I find the character design very charming.  The game is really fun, too.

I even knew a good amount of what would happen ahead of time because of what I had read and seen, and it was still exciting.  There is also a lot to do.  After about 40 hours, I still haven't done everything.\nI have a few things I want to add.  If you're wondering if it works well on a PS2.  Yes, perfectly.  And one more thing.  I bought the game used, not greatest hits, and it had trouble because of the condition it was in, so I bought a new copy that is the greatest hits version.  The older one comes with a case that is very annoying because it is really hard to get disc 2 out.  I was worried about having to bend the disc to get it out.

I still remember seeing the preview for it on TV: \"An evil empire is sucking the life force from the planet, destroying all that's in its path.  It's up to one soldier of fortune to save the world.  If he succeeds, you survive.  If he fails, you can always hit the reset button.\"  After the game came out, it was months before I could afford it.  It was worth it.  Over a decade later, no game has come close in meaning as much to me as this one.\n\nThe story has a grown-up, realistic tone to it.  Contrary to the old television preview, it is not an evil empire or kingdom that has taken over the world, but a corporation: Shinra Electric Power Company.  The world is technologically advanced.  The heroes sit at bars and ride trains and watch television.  But it is also a world where magic is possible.  Some of your characters use guns, some use sorcery or martial arts, and of course Cloud wields his famously massive sword, and because of terrific world-building, you can buy into the conceit with ease.  (Of course Cloud uses a sword in a world with guns and laser beams.  He's a super-soldier created in a complicated combination of magical infusion and injection with the cells of an alien being, so he's strong and fast enough that a sword is more useful to him than a gun.)  The journey of the game's heroes through the world is nothing short of epic.  I still have fond memories of the places I traveled to in this game: the slums of Midgar, the Temple of the Ancients, Rocket Town, The Gold Saucer, even the Lost City of the Ancients...\n\nThis game almost made me cry.  That's how beloved its characters are.  Sephiroth is the greatest villain of any game.  (One of my favorite moments in the game is when the heroes had to cross a swamp where a giant snake lived.  When they tried to fight the thing, it defeated all of them with ease, so the heroes had to ride across the swamp on steeds so they could outrun it instead of fighting it.  And on the other side of the swamp lies...the cut up corpse of the same kind of giant snake.  Sephiroth took it out single-handedly.)  Aeris is just a beautiful character, a pure-hearted girl raised in the slums but born with a special connection to the planet's life force.  And Cloud is the coolest of heroes.  He's noble, a little bit cocky, and kind of psychologically messed up with his repressed memories and all.  And when you find out the truth about his past...that just makes him cooler, in my opinion.\n\nThere are moments in this game that will stay with you forever.  They are iconic.  If you've played the game, you know what I mean.  Seeing Sephiroth destroy Cloud's hometown comes to mind.  He's standing in the fire unharmed and their eyes meet for a moment, then he turns and strides casually through the flames.  And that spooky music is playing (\"Those Chosen By The Planet\") with its bells tolling....  Or when a main character dies (the moment that nearly made me--and a lot of other people--cry at a video game), then that music plays.  On that note, the music in this game is pitch perfect.  The tense, rocking music for the boss battles, the creepy alien music when the heroes encounter Jenova (or parts of her), the absolutely beautiful \"Aeris' Theme.\"  And the exultant, darkly emotional \"One Winged Angel,\" which plays during the game's climax is awesome.\n\nSo there you have it.  Video games' greatest hero and villain all in one place.  The coolest world combining science, sorcery, robot cats, and even a rocket ship.  Music that will haunt you.  An epic story about life, and humanity's place in it.  Characters that feel more like friends.  I keep waiting for a game to come along that will match this one, and I've played many games since.  If you have never played this before then don't let the outdated graphics scare you away (I remember how impressed I was with them at the time).  Even now, it's still worth it.","summary":"Life has chosen its Soldier.","unixReviewTime":1302393600,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

But I would love to play it again someday (maybe on PSN) and would love even more a remake done in HD.\n\nI've been an RPG fan ever since.","summary":"Greatest Video Game Memories Ever","unixReviewTime":1295222400,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

I guess it was because I wanted to pursue the game in my own time. Besides, back when this game first came out, you hardly ever found a copy on the shelf to buy. I was always one of the unlucky ones, it seemed. Finally, after obtaining a copy for myself, I got to see what all the 'hoopla' was about.\n\nThe story, itself(as you probably already know by playing it), is about Cloud Strife. Cloud is a mercenary who joins with a group of others(Avalanche) to stop a megacorporation callled Shinra. Shinra is draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source. Course, the story progresses and deepens when Sephiroth(the game's main antagonist) comes into play. Sephiroth's part in this story?...if the world is damaged, its' Lifestream will gather together in an attempt to heal the wound. Sephiroth plans to use a powerful spell called \"Meteor\" to cause this injury, and then merge with the planet's energy, allowing him to be reborn as a god. Then, he plans to rule over the planet.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII has a long history behind it. FF7 was planned, first, as a new game for the SNES and was quickly moved to Nintendo's new system at the time, the Nintendo 64. Due to lack of catridge storage capacity, it eventually led to a dispute between Nintendo and Square that resulted in Square ending its long relationship with Nintendo.  Square decided, from that point, to release Final Fantasy VII for the Sony Playstation. The game has went on to sell well over 9.8 Million copies worldwide. It's spawned a series of other games under the FF7 name but none have quite reached the status that the original has. A remake has been rumored for quite some time now but, as of yet, no remake has been produced by Square. My opinion on the remake or lack thereof? Well, considering at to how they made a killing on fans buying the first game when it came out, it's almost guaranteed that they would make a killing a second time. I don't understand why they won't give the fans what they want. They'd come out alot better because of it. It would, definitely, put them back on top as the leader of RPGs..to be sure. Course, enough on the subject, right?\n\nOnto the meat of this review..What do I think of Final Fantasy VII?? First and foremost, it is quite an achievement in the RPG genre. It was the RPG where players found themselves in a three-dimensional world that, after playing the game, they actually felt like they'd went on an epic journey. It's the only game other than Legend of Zelda:Ocarina of Time where I ever felt that way. It was also the first RPG to really evoke some emotion out of me. The characters weren't two-dimensional, they had character and you could invest in that. It helped set the standard for all other RPGs to follow to this day. Too bad, though, you hardly see traditional turn-based RPGs like these anymore.  Sure, you may on the Nintendo DS and the Sony Playstation Portable but not much on any of the console systems these days. While it may seem dated in a time when everything is in 3-D and not 3-D on prerendered backgrounds, it still stands the test of time. The story holds up as well, even if it is a little hard to figure things out at times. The battles are engaging and the game is just fun! While I won't say it's my most favorite FF game; it's one of the games that got me hooked on RPGs. There's never a shortage of good things that can be said about this game.\n\nDo I have any gripes about the game? Just one thing...the ending.  The ending is kind of sudden and, as another reviewer stated elsewhere, it just ends. Not quite like Legacy of Kain:Soul Reaver did back in the day, though...nothing like that. The way it ends leaves you wanting more. Maybe it was intended to be that way...you think?\n\nAll in all, Final Fantasy VII is a game that I highly highly recommend that everyone(and I do mean everyone) should play-at least once-even if you're not into RPGs. It'll definitely give you a better understanding of RPGs and why people love playing them so much.","summary":"Final Fantasy VII.............","unixReviewTime":1282089600,"vote":"6","style":null,"image":null}

Love it or hate it, Final Fantasy 7 broke new ground in the RPG market, and games today have a lot to be thankful for that Final Fantasy 7 made possible.\n\nFor those who haven't played this title, it is going to appear very dated, especially the hideously deformed polygon characters.  But the backgrounds are beautiful scenes based on hand drawn pictures.  The backgrounds are set, so they don't move.  Instead you move around them.  It was a style used extensively on the PS1 and still used in other games today (especially on the portable systems).  Granted, many of us would love to see a remake, and that might happen someday, but not likely any year soon.\n\nI will just sum up what I love about this game, even in today's market of amazing games (and a lot of terrible games or super easy games also).  First, the game was insanely easy.  I died once on my first play through (against Lost Number before I realized what to do), and I don't believe I saw a gameover screen since.  But the ease of the game is not an issue.  There is still some challenge, and part of what makes the game enjoyable is the lack of 'cheap' enemies.  But once you get the hang of things, it is super easy.\n\nThe story is amazing, and only Final Fantasy 10 has really compared.  Final Fantasy 6 was such a great title, that I never thought anything could top it, but FF7 just drew me in and didn't let me go.  I couldn't believe the intrigue, the depth, the complexity of the story.  I found myself on edge at school (I was in high school when it first released) and I couldn't wait to get home to play it.  When Cloud goes against Rufus near the end of the Midgar arc, I knew I loved this game.  When it took over 2 hours of game play to get to a world map, I knew something was special.  And when the game cuts (in real time) to the CG of Junon's cannon, I was stunned.\n\nWith the pretty games of this era, one might be unimpressed, but if you remember the era when this game was made, it broke ground that developers feared.  First true epic big budget RPG with cut scene CGI.  Low to zero loading times (so happy for that!).  A central character that is killed mid way through the game.  And an amazing depth of side quests and extras at the end of the game that were fun and rewarding.\n\nGoing back, it may not match up against some more recent titles in every facet, but overall this is still a solid and spectacular game.  In my opinion only Zelda The Ocarina of Time and Super Mario World can compare with this title in overall quality and fun.  Though I have other personal favorites (big shout out for Ogre Battle!), I cannot argue that Final Fantasy 7 is among the three best games of all time, and easily the most ground breaking RPG ever.  As nostalgic as the earlier titles are (and I love them all), this game just proves that solid gameplay and an amazing story are timeless.","summary":"Just played through it again, reinforces my love of this title ~","unixReviewTime":1280966400,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

I however spent over a year & half playing this game alone. My first playstation died because of this game.\n\nThis game gets soo much praise & even has been hailed as 'Quite Possibly The Greatest Game Ever Made', however that's not possible, only to those who think this is the greatest game ever made. But i urge people to try this game out, despite the outdated graphics & no voice overs.\n\nYou start off as a mercenary, an Ex-Soldier named Cloud who is working with a group named 'Avalanche', a team of members who infiltrates Shin-Ra's biggest Mako city, Midgar. Mako is destroying the planet & Avalanche (known as hippies or treehuggers) is trying to stop that from happening. What Cloud doesn't realize is he's closer to Shin-Ra then he thinks. And a mysterious man known as Sephiroth suddenly attacks Midgar after a tragic event that took place in.. Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII\n\nCloud must search for this man as he deals with Shin-Ra & the Turks. All while he tries not to lose his sanity.\n\nStory 10\/10:\nThe story for this game is superb, although it lacks a few minor details that not even Crisis Core reveals it still has one of my favorite story-lines in the entire history of videogames or movies. I do recommend you play this game before Crisis Core (before Nibelheim) just because Crisis Core reveals what really happens to Cloud & then this game won't really keep you interested. Besides that though i really think this game is still considered one of the best!\n\nGraphics 6\/10:\nThe graphics for this game was superb when it first came out. No one still really cared too much about them yet & Square really showed them off for this game (this game was originally in production for the N64) except for the fact that you have blocks as hands! I believe the main game for the N64 wasn't completely scrapped as they were trying to make this for that system but then realized the potential of having CG clips for the PlayStation they went with that system instead. So for those wondering why the graphics look so cartoony in this one, im pretty sure thats your answer. The CG movies still look amazing for the ps1, granted that Square got better at it with FFVIII. Either way, Square is trying to get the original team from this game to pull off a grand remake (to make this game look REALLY NICE) which is still in question, however they have other games they're working on now\n\nGameplay 7\/10:\nWell, lets just say that its not hard but its not easy, of course the actual battles are fairly simple if you know what your doing. And leveling up your characters & materia are the only main factors you have to worry about in progressing in the game. The problem with moving your character around is that your fumbling around with the directional sometimes because its not quite calibrated right. Or its just the camera view, however its annoying at times.\n\nMusic\/Sound (10\/10):\nI enjoyed the music from this game, i still think it's one of the best ones Square did. Everything from the Bombing mission to Cid's theme this game has it done perfectly! Another good reason why Square wanted this game on the PlayStation, crystal clear stereo sound!\n\nConcept 6\/10:\nWhile it took me several times to go through the game (and beat it) which for some people who don't understand the story will have to play it through a few times. The thing that people get most confused on is the materia setup. While it was easy for me to grasp some people were like 'huh!?!?' It's like trying to teach a cat how to drive. I thought this concept was easier then some of the FF games that came out after this one. But yet again, easy for some, hard for others.\n\nReplay Value 10\/10:\nPersonally i think this game should have had a new game+ function (where you can go through the game again with stats, materia, items ect. But maybe if Square gets a remake going they'll throw that function in. Only because i never get tired of this game & its one game that does deserve a remake.\n\nOverall, i did give this a full 5 star rating only because i still think this game is the best, despite its problems. And for those who haven't yet check out Crisis Core as well, great prequel to this game.\n\nOther thoughts:\n\nWhile this game is good, if you got a psp or a ps3 you can download the game from the PSN. But thats only if you don't really care about having a physical copy.","summary":"Best. Game. Ever. Enough Said..","unixReviewTime":1273449600,"vote":"6","style":null,"image":null}

I played Final Fantasy Adventure on the original Game Boy as a kid, and now that I've grown up into a gamer I figured I'd better go back and play some of the \"classics,\" and FF-VII was near the top of every list I could think of. So this review will be free of nostalgia, since I didn't ever play the game before two months ago.\n\nIf you're reading this I assume you know the basics (this is an RPG, the first 3D Final Fantasy, et cetera). I'm also going to take for granted that you realize that is game is over a decade old, and as such it's a liitle unfair to compare it to today's games (though it has aged remarkably well).\n\nThis is an original Playstation title, so it will play on your PS3 (where it's also available as a download from the PSN) and your PS2. You will only be able to save it on the PS2 if you have a PS1 memory card. I don't own a PS3, so I can't vouch for its saving capability.\n\nYou're tossed into the action from the moment you start the game (this becomes a plot device later, actually). That made me wonder about if the game would be lacking in any kind of non-character-model cutscenes, but I was soon proven wrong: the cutscenes are beautiful, even by today's standards.\n\nThe combat system uses what's called the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, a decent blend of turn-based and real-time. Each character has a time bar, and when it fills you input a command. Commands are executed one at a time, in the order they were chosen. Bars fill up during selection and sometimes during the execution (depending on the action), giving an element of real-time. I had a gripe with this system as the game went on, as trying to locate one of the hundred or so items on my list was getting my characters hurt, but the feature can be turned off without penalty in the menu.\n\nThe story is pleasingly deep, both in the main storyline as well as individual storylines for each character. The list of items and equipment is extensive. There is also an extremely high replay value for a single-player game, as the world is so vast, the items so plentiful, and the rewards for sidequesting high, including Yuffie and Vincent (two party characters) and a wealth of exclusive items, usually materia (used to cast magic, add a buff, or add extra abilities) or Limit items, which give characters a sort of ultra attack.\n\nThough few and minor, the game does have its flaws. Perhaps the most glaring is the lack of save points (you only get one) in the final level, which is pretty bad considering how devastating a lot of the enemies are. The game usually is portrayed as 3D character running around on what appears to be a 2D matte painting; it looks beautiful, but occasionally is hard to figure out what's a path or exit and what isn't.\n\nAll told, though, the gripes are far outweighed by the quality of the game. Yes, this game is a classic for a reason. If you have ever played an RPG and liked it, give FF-VII a try. I did, and now I'm a believer.","summary":"Thoughts from a non-diehard fan to those considering a classic","unixReviewTime":1260057600,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Final Fantasy 3 on the SNES, was a great success.  Many magazines like GamePro and EGM have praised it for its rich plot and complex scenarios.  Nintendo Power even called it \"the RPG hit of the decade.\"  Fans of the Super Nintendo and RPGs rejoiced over how great this game was, and with a slew of other RPGs on the system like Chrono Trigger, ActRaiser, and Nintendo's A Link to the Past, a lot of fans---myself included---generally regard this period as one of the best video game production times of our generation, if not THE best.\n\nAlong comes the Sony PlayStation.  For some, this marks the end of the Golden Age of classic video games.  I don't entirely agree, as that system was the home of a handful classics; Castlevania: Symphony of the Night revitalized the Castlevania series and outranked many of the 3-D games that cropped up at the time.  Metal Gear Solid redefined stealth action and brought Solid Snake into the mainstream.  Mega Man X4 continued the saga of Mega Man X and combined the old-school flavor of Mega Man with arcade-style, frenetic action.\n\nNow, we get into Final Fantasy 7.  The first game, besides the original, to be correctly numbered.  If you've read my FF6 review, I said that that game was the end of the magic era and the introduction of industrial technology.  FF7 takes that further into a dystopian technological atmosphere; its bleak, dark outlook is not dissimilar to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.  This was a stark contrast to the previous games that were about grandiose medieval adventure.  No more dragons, colorful highlands, and sorcery.  No more saving the princess from mortal doom.  No more four crystals and light warriors.\n\nWhen I first played this game back in 1997, my first thought was \"This isn't Final Fantasy!  I mean, they curse in the game, too!  How dare they change my Final Fantasy?!  How dare they take away what I loved about it?!\"  Yet, many of my friends loved it, and still love it for its nostalgic factor.  Heck, it's sold over ten million copies worldwide, making it the highest-selling Final Fantasy of ALL time.\n\nComing from that stubborn mold, I didn't give the game an objective eye and realized years later that I initally rejected it under a false pretense.  Is it my favorite Final Fantasy game of all time?  Well, no, but I am giving it its credit now, and there are many aspects of the game that help make it the top-selling Final Fantasy game.\n\nThe story centers on a former SOLDIER named Cloud Strife, who joins the AVALANCHE group in trying to take down Shinra, Inc., a megolomaniacal corporation that's draining the planet's life force.  He's a bit less colorful than some of the main characters of past Final Fantasies (even further games), but through the course of the game, he has a very interesting backstory.  He is joined by Barrett, the leader of AVALANCHE and the closest video game character akin to Mr. T; Tifa Lockhart, a sexy martial artist and friend of Cloud's; Aeris, a flower merchant who turns out to be a \"Cetra,\" the previous owners of the planet; Red XIII, a cat creature that was experimented on by Shinra; Cid Highwind, a pilot with Dragoon Knight characteristics (and ironically, shares the same last name as Kain from Final Fantasy 4!  What delight!); Vincent, an immortal that previously worked with Shinra before his \"death\"...and Yuffie, a young thief who plays tricks on the party.  Oh, and then there's Cait Sith, but let's move on...\n\nThe villain that everyone talks about from this game is Sephiroth.  In my FF6 review, I thought Kefka was the best Final Fantasy villain ever.  I still believe that, but Sephiroth is still one of the greatest villains in any RPG.  Sephiroth does have some interesting motives; he is originally Cloud's friend, even a mentor, and the best member of SOLDIER for a time.  However, upon learning what appeared to be his real past (not quite real, but no spoilers here!), he progressively goes insane and is hell bent on bringing back the \"Promised Land,\" which basically means wounding the planet and sucking its life force.  While he's not your typical, heartless villain (not saying Kefka is typical, but you feel from the first hour of that game that he is downright evil.), he is a mentally distraught, horribly twisted person, and that progression of madness that worsens throughout the game is actually very well transitioned.  Plus, he is responsible for murdering Aeris, scarring the mind of my RPG generation forever.\n\nWhile the battle system only allows three people, the Materia system and the Limit Breaks add fun to the game.  While I adore Final Fantasy 9, 7's Limit Breaks worked better, and they also level up.  The Materia system is based on your weapons and items' slots, allowing you to interchange materia like ice, fire, lightning, restore, and other things.  They also do things differently depending on how they're linked to other materia and ALSO if they're attached to your weapon or your accessory.  This adds some fun to the battle, and you can even interchange materia without disrupting the level of the particular materia slot you're using.\n\nThe story is as epic as any great Final Fantasy should be, although I do admit that the ending is a bit lax...still, it was followed up by sequels, so at least the story did continue.  Most of the characters are interesting, even colorful (Cid and Barrett's constant swearing definitely added flavor to this FF entry!).  Cloud's complex relationships with Aeris and Tifa are among the story's highlights, and of course, the culmination of Cloud facing his former friend and idol.\n\nThe music is once again composed by Nobou Uematsu, and he delivers once again.  My ONLY complaint is not with his compositions itself, but with the sound quality.  The Sony PlayStation had a superior sound chip system in comparison to the Super NES, yet the sound quality of games like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 3 (er, 6!) blasted you with superb sound quality.  I don't hold this against the game to any large degree, but I did find that kind of odd...especially if you hear Michiru Yamane's score for Symphony of the Night or Toshihiko Horiyama's score for Mega Man X4.\n\nOverall, my final opinion of the game.  I've grown to like this game despite my love for the more medieval-styled Final Fantasies of the past.  This one was a departure from the past, adding more mature elements into the game (colorful language, sexual references, etc. etc.).  Definitely your big brother's kind of RPG.  While some may dispute its \"overrated\" longevity, its success on the Sony PlayStation became a part of that system's legacy and it also brought RPGs to the mainstream audience.\n\nYes, it's insanely popular, but give the game its due.  It's worthy of the qualities that have made it the best-selling Final Fantasy, and while it may not be my personal favorite, it kicks major amounts of awesome nonetheless.\n\nOther Recommendations:\nFinal Fantasy 6 (in my opinion, perfectly accompanies this game)\nChrono Trigger (SNES)\nBreath of Fires 2 and 3 (SNES,PSX)\nXenogears (PSX)\nCastlevania Symphony of the Night (PSX)","summary":"Overrated?

This review, hopefully, will be slightly different than most - I love RPGs, but never played FFVII back in the day and just completed it for the first time.  So I'm not really biased due to loving the game back in my younger years and will try to review with an objective eye.\n\nAs you can probably gather from the mountain of other reviews, this was the game that, for better and worse, changed the RPG genre.  The, somewhat dense, storyline basically revolves around Cloud and company in their quest to save the planet from various forces (mainly the evil company Shinra and, the very VERY evil, bad guy Sephiroth).  Several traditional RPG elements are present - battle monsters, equip magic, find new and better weapons, grind your character up, etc...\n\nSo, what made the game different?  Basically, two things (in my opinion).  The first, as talked about above, is the storyline.  Yeah, it's the typical, \"save the world\" stuff that can be found in oodles of other RPGs, but this it is different - it was deep, filled with twists and turns, and was more like an actual story you would find in a novel.  Some would say the story borders on being convoluted (a complaint I have a hard time arguing with), but it holds up well today and was nothing short of groundbreaking 10-15 years ago.\n\nThe second was the amazing graphics and cut scenes.  Of course, neither are nearly as good as the more recent stuff, but again it was revolutionary at the time and everybody loved it.  Combining the \"fun\" elements of RPGs that were already present with a deeper story and amazing graphics and it is no wonder this is one of the most beloved games of all time.\n\nStill, the game does have its warts.  First, it is a very linear story.  Part of the charm of some of those early Final Fantasy games (and other RPGs) was the feeling you could explore the entire world.  Here, for about two-thirds of the game, you have no control over where your characters go or what happens (it's really like reading a book).  By the time you actually get the airship (and can really start exploring) you are just about ready for the final showdown.  Plus some of the really cool weapons to found cannot be obtained until you have virtually completed the game (Final Fantasy games have done this for years, and I have never understood it, what is the point of these amazing weapons when, by the time you can acquire them, your characters are so leveled up they are killing everything with ease anyway?).\n\nThe second major issue, touched on above, is the fact that this story is tough to keep up with at times.  I've played Crisis Core (the prequel to this game) and that helped a lot, but there are times when you are just going to be like, \"what in the blue sane h*ll is going on here?\" Yeah, the story is different, but different isn't always better.\n\nOverall, the game is one of those games that should be played by all gamers.  Yeah, there are problems (the story, the somewhat dated graphics, the linear game play), but it's still an amazing play.  By the way, you can download the game from the Playstation Store for both the PSP and PS3 for [...]- so do not pay these insanely high prices.","summary":"Classic game that holds up well in 2009","unixReviewTime":1248825600,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Final Fantasy 7, the first Final Fantasy on the Playstation and to use 3D graphics, changed everything about the console RPG genre.  Even though people will have differing opinions about the enjoyability of this game, no serious gamer would deny the tremendous influence Final Fantasy 7 has had on videogaming.\n\nBy today's standards, the graphics in this game are quite primitive, but at the time they were absolutely amazing.  The 2D backgrounds are still great to look at today, as well.  The music in this game is also great, despite the rather limited selection of sounds Nobou Uematsu had at his disposal.  Of particular note is the song that plays during the final boss encounter, \"One Winged Angel\", which is still beloved by Final Fantasy fans today.\n\nDespite the move from 2D to 3D, the gameplay in Final Fantasy 7 is  similar to the previous six Final Fantasy games.  As you control your character on an overworld map, you encounter random mobs which you fight in an \"active time battle\" system.  The magic system, based on \"materia\", is new and just complicated enough to provide some strategic depth without overwhelming new players.  Playing through the main story is not particularly challenging (some bosses may require a few tries), but there are extensive side quests available at the end of the game, some of which are very involved and difficult without a solid strategy.\n\nHowever, the main attraction of this game is the story.  Anyone who has played through the game will remember Cloud, his friends, and the enigmatic Sephiroth, who are still iconic figures in the game world.  (That Square-Enix still releases games and movies based on the FF7 world helps, no doubt.)  The plot is quite strange and frequently confusing, but in its essentials it worked for me.  The translation could have used some more polish, but is of good enough quality as to not distract from the rest of the game.\n\nIf there are people studying the history of video games fifty years from now, there is little doubt that Final Fantasy 7 would be one of the games they would look at, since it is probably the most influential console RPG ever.  If you haven't played this game yet and have any interest in RPGs, at all, you should try to find a copy of this game and play it.  If only Square-Enix would re-make this game for the PS3!","summary":"A classic in RPG history","unixReviewTime":1243555200,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

This game gets soo much praise (and well blasphemy too) & even has been hailed as 'Quite Possibly The Greatest Game Ever Made', however that's not possible, only to those who think this is the greatest game ever made. But i urge people to try this game out, despite the outdated graphics & no voice overs.\n\nYou start off as a mercenary, an Ex-Soldier named Cloud who is working with a group named 'Avalanche', a team of members who infiltrates Shin-Ra's biggest Mako city, Midgar. Mako is destroying the planet & Avalanche (known as hippies or treehuggers) is trying to stop that from happening. What Cloud doesn't realize is he's closer to Shin-Ra then he thinks. And a mysterious man known as Sephiroth suddenly attacks Midgar after a tragic event that took place in..&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Crisis-Core-Final-Fantasy-VII\/dp\/B0014X7SQ6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII<\/a>\n\nCloud must search for this man as he deals with Shin-Ra & the Turks. All while he tries not to lose his sanity.\n\nOk in my opinion the best way to un-cover this story is to play the first half of Crisis Core (until you reach Nibelheim) then start playing FFVII (this game) until after you get past the part where you find out about Zack.  Then go back to Crisis Core, beat that then finish FFVII.  It doesn't really matter what game you play first & vise versa but if you play this game all the way through it pretty much spoils the ending for Crisis Core.  Although i still think it was exciting to see the ending in higher graphic quality i just knew what was going to happen.\n\nAnyways on with the review..\n\nStory 10\/10:\nThe story for this game is superb, although it lacks a few minor details that not even Crisis Core reveals it still has one of my favorite story-lines in the entire history of videogames or movies. I do recommend you play this game before Crisis Core (before Nibelheim) just because Crisis Core reveals what really happens to Cloud & then this game won't really keep you interested. Besides that though i really think this game is still considered one of the best!\n\nGraphics 6\/10:\nThe graphics for this game was superb when it first came out. No one still really cared too much about them yet & Square really showed them off for this game (this game was originally in production for the N64) except for the fact that you have blocks as hands! I believe the main game for the N64 wasn't completely scrapped as they were trying to make this for that system but then realized the potential of having CG clips for the PlayStation they went with that system instead. So for those wondering why the graphics look so cartoony in this one, im pretty sure thats your answer. The CG movies still look amazing for the ps1, granted that Square got better at it with FFVIII. Either way, Square is trying to get the original team from this game to pull off a grand remake (to make this game look REALLY NICE) which is still in question, however they have other games they're working on now\n\nGameplay 7\/10:\nWell, lets just say that its not hard but its not easy, of course the actual battles are fairly simple if you know what your doing. And leveling up your characters & materia are the only main factors you have to worry about in progressing in the game.  The problem with moving your character around is that your fumbling around with the directional sometimes because its not quite calibrated right. Or its just the camera view, however its annoying at times.\n\nMusic\/Sound (10\/10):\nI enjoyed the music from this game, i still think it's one of the best ones Square did. Everything from the Bombing mission to Cid's theme this game has it done perfectly! Another good reason why Square wanted this game on the PlayStation, crystal clear stereo sound!\n\nConcept 6\/10:\nWhile it took me several times to go through the game (and beat it) which for some people who don't understand the story will have to play it through a few times. The thing that people get most confused on is the materia setup.  While it was easy for me to grasp some people were like 'huh!?!?' It's like trying to teach a cat how to drive.  I thought this concept was easier then some of the FF games that came out after this one.  But yet again, easy for some, hard for others.\n\nReplay Value 10\/10:\nPersonally i think this game should have had a new game+ function (where you can go through the game again with stats, materia, items ect.  But maybe if Square gets a remake going they'll throw that function in. Only because i never get tired of this game & its one game that does deserve a remake.\n\nOverall, i did give this a full 5 star rating only because i still think this game is the best, despite its problems. And for those who haven't yet check out Crisis Core as well, great prequel to this game.","summary":"An Epic Adventure!

I don't give VII 5 stars because its the first final fantasy game I played, I give it 5 stars because it truly is an amazing roller coaster of excitement, emotion and even add humor into the mix as well as not being just kid friendly. Not only that but it has the one of the most memorable vilians if not the most memorable one, Sephiroth.\n\nStoryline: In VII you play as Cloud Strife a mercenary for hire. As the game begins you are thrust into battle immediately as you have joined up with a rebel (or terrorist, if you will) group called Avolanche, who either its members or supporters needs to learn how to spell, to blow up a Shinra reactor in the city of Midgar. Shinra is a corporation that is sucking the energy, called Mako, out of the planet which is slowly killing the planet. After this job and the next you end up joining Avolanche and pretty much becoming the leader of the group taking over Barret's spot. As the story progresses you find out you were a member of a group called Soldier, Shinra's elite soldiers, and befriending the main villian Sephiroth. Thats the introduction to VII as I will not go into it any deeper. I will say that the story gets more complex, very emotional and has some really good twists along the way. It also deals with more adult themes such as cussing and even some cross-dressing to name a few.\n\nCharacters: Square dived in really deep on some characters background and left others barely scratched. Cloud and Sephiroth have the most character develpment in the game and their story's intertwine quite a bit. As the game progresses though, Sephiroth and Cloud's stories start developing on their own and not relying on each others. Aeris role and story in the game is probably the most important supporting characters in the game followed closely by Red XIII. Tifa, Barret and Cid get good stories into their backgrounds and definately add their importance in the story as well. Another member is Cait Sith who you find little about and forces his way into the party. Vincent and Yuffie are optional characters to have in your party and can easily be missed to get if you aren't paying attention, assuming you want them in the party in the first place. They don't play much part in the story and have very little background insight on them during the game.\n\nCombat System: The combat system is developed around whats called materia. Its what you need to use magic and can be found after defeating bosses, lying around in room or just bought in stores. Everything that has to do with fighting is centered around materia, from equipping your weapons and items to casting magic-its a must to be knowledgeable about how to use your materia and use it properly. Your materia also gains experience in battles, not by using it though, but by equipping it to your armor and items you have equipped on your character. You can also use materia together such as the \"all\" and \"fire\" materia. You equip it on your weapon or item that has a sideways figure 8 looking thing on it and when you cast fire you hit all your enemies instead of one. The last thing about materia is once you max out your experience in say your \"fire\" materia it reproduces another one starting the new materia experince at 0 and you now have 2 fire materias instead of one-You can also do that to the summon materia's too. A few other things about the combat is its an active time battle system which means while your choosing your commands for characters the enemy won't hang around and wait to attack. The last thing is your limit breaks which are special attacks that you get after your \"anger\" meter (I guess that what you can call it) fills up. You can set it to allies getting hit or if that particular character gets hit. There is a lot of materia out there so don't be afraid to mix and match to see what goes with what.\n\nGraphics: The graphics in this game especially for its time, I thought to be simply unbelievable. The random battles are done in 3-D, a first that I know of, for an rpg to do that on a console system and definately set the bar for rpg's to follow. The cg clips were simply breathtaking at the time but after today's games its hard to believe I thought that when I first played the game. You can tell that they were definitely trying to move past the sprite based characters (which they did in battles) from the previous games but they just couldn't leap that hurdle until Final Fantasy VIII. The backgrounds were interactive instead of just being completely preset, but weren't fully 3-D, I guess you could call it 2-D interactive.\n\nMusic: Music is definitely one thing that can single handedly ruin an rpg such as repetitive fight music and travelling music. This is another area where VII excelled at. Sephiroth was given his own theme music (one that most players if they heard would identify it in a split second) and music at the gold saucer was definitely theme park music. Aeris' theme was also very memorable and after a certain event in the game, upon hearing it you might be caught off guard and you could find yourself tearing up. Even orhestra's have had concerts where you could find them playing music from VII and even other final fantasy titles.\n\nMinigames: This is one area where Square could've done better. They have many minigames but few of the games are fun like the snowboarding and motorcycle chase. The others were rather boring and got old really quick. The chocobo races were fun but chocobo breeding was time consuming and ultimately a pain to do. The Gold chocobo was random in breeding and you could end up reseting you playstation for over an hour trying to get it. I persisted and got mine but the reward was almost not worth the hours slaving over it. Just remember if you don't do it you never get to get the Knights of the Round materia, which is the most powerful summon in the game.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII came from out of nowhere hitting the world like an asteroid sending shockwaves all over the video game nation. It single handedly put rpg's on the map for the non-hardcore gamers and sent hardcore gamers into an rpg frenzy. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but you can't deny that Final Fantasy VII deserved the hype that it created. It took all the best aspects of rpg's such as the story, love story, character build-up, an easy to use and tactical fighting system and combined 3-D models for its random battles, an interactive background and music that has been remembered for over a decade. Also having follow up games years later coming out because of the huge fan base. You can say that another rpg would have done it sooner or later but the truth is Square put one heck of a game together and they did it first.\n\nYou can call me a square fanboy if you want but the truth is I'm an rpg lover. Yes, I have played almost all the final fantasy rpg's out there. I have also played the incredible Lunar games, Grandia games, Xenogears, Xenosaga, Legend of Legaia, Legend of Dragoon and the list goes on and on to more recent titles on the ps2 and 360. The truth is that none of those rpg's shook the foundation of the entire gaming world and turned it completely upside down. Even people who hate rpg's hate this game the most out of all the rpg's out there because its the one they had to hear about the most!\n\nFinal Fantasy VII gets a straight 5 out of 5 and deserves more for the bars they broke and limits they pushed. Not only that, but its characters are timeless and memorable, its story is amazing and emotional and the music is like none other for its time.","summary":"A late review","unixReviewTime":1223683200,"vote":"3","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Boasting a colossal story and a few memorable characters.  Final Fantasy VII is the game which made the JRPG genre big in the West and eleven years later it still ranks as one of the greatest games of all time.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII centers on Cloud Strife.  A mercenary who has joined the rebelious group known as AVALANCHE, who are taking on the Shinra Corporation, that is slowly draining the planet of its life.  The story all comes together by Cloud's mysterious past, a terrifying villain and some heartfelt characters.  The story of Final Fantasy VII spans so much more than just an evil Corporation.  You'll eventually find yourself on a journey that involves you saving the world.  Even compared to today, Final Fantasy VII is an RPG that breaks the rules of traditional storytelling.  Rather than being a band of teenagers out to stop some evil adults (as the JRPG has been drowned out in in recent years), Final Fantasy VII puts you in the role of characters about something more.  If there were any criticism of the story, it would be that it's a lot to take in.  Some things never really come together in the end and you'll be left with a lot of burning questions.  Much of this, you can bet, is due to some of Final Fantasy VII's shoddy translation.  There were some pieces in the localization process that were left out entirely and make the story come off as a little more sloppy than it was intended to.  Another small criticism comes with its characters.  While they're memorable, they often times take a backseat to some of the stories progression.  Once we learn what we need to learn about certain characters, the game never really touches them or makes them integral to the plot itself again.  If it weren't for their stark personalities, funny quips and own charms, you might forget them.\n\nEver since Final Fantasy IV, the series has used the ATB battle system and Final Fantasy VII is no exception.  Every character has an ATB gauge that lets them take action once it's filled.  Pretty basic, but Final Fantasy VII gets a bump by being very customizable.  The Materia system allows for nearly endless possibilities for its characters.  There are several different kinds of Materia.  There's your basic magic materia that give you spells to cast, but there is also materia to give you more battle commands such as being able to steal or throw items at an enemy.  There are other materia there just to boost your stats and others that enhance your spells by giving you the ability to hit all the enemies at once or to absorb health from your enemies.  There are far more in each category and they give you infinite ways to play Final Fantasy VII.\n\nWithout materia, though, your characters are naked and can only attack.  This brings about small problem.  The first being that there's is no incentive to use any one character above another.  Final Fantasy VII remedies this by givng its character ultra powerful limit breaks.  Every character has a limit gauge and when it fills up as they take damage.  When full they can let forth a brutal attack.  Characters also have limit levels for different limit breaks and the higher the Limit Level the more damage you have to take before its full.  Unfortunately, this is all that makes any character different in battle.  Materia gives them legs, but you can always transfer over anyone else's materia to anyone else.  In the long run this won't bother anyone, but it leads to a lack of variety in the characters and you more than likely won't need limit breaks that much to begin with.  Final Fantasy VII's pros more than outnumber the cons.  The amount of customization is great, but it still would've been nice to need one character's ability over another.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII is by no means a hard game.  It is arguably one of the easiest games in the series.  In particular, the final battle turns out to be one of the easiest fights in the game against someone who has often been labeled one of the most threatening in history.  Yet Final Fantasy VII makes for that with several hidden goodies.  You won't find too many optional dungeons in Final Fantasy VII, but you will find an incredible number of optional things to do off the beaten path.  From breeding and racing Chocobos, to finding hidden materia, to taking on ultra powerful bosses and even finding hidden characters who have more than just a face, but actually play into the story itself.  There are more secrets in Final Fantasy VII than even most RPGs of today.\n\nGraphically Final Fantasy VII is a mixed bag.  In 1997 these graphics were phenominal.  the pre-rendered backgrounds are still incredible looking even to this day.  The seventh Final Fantasy has a lot of style.  The polygons are charming though they don't look as cool as the rest of the environments.  The FMVs are still amazing and wonderfully detailed for its time.  There are a couple of moments of slowdown with Final Fantasy VII, however, and some of the summon animations can get lengthy and repetitive.  But they don't take away from its wildly detaile environments.\n\nThe music score may actually be the most rewarding thing for Final Fantasy VII.  The music score manages to fill the situations for the right moment.  But it also isn't afraid to showcase a lot of emotion either.  There are some moments where it can be dark and others where it's very light.  In particular, the character themes are really nice and memorable.  Final Fantasy VII doesn't have the best soundtrack within the series, but it has some of the most memorable music numbers of the entire series.\n\nAfter eleven years Final Fantasy VII is still a force to be reckoned with.  There are a few gaps in its storyline that you may have to read a bit more deeply to learn about (as not all of it is within the game itself, but if anything confuses you there have been countless FAQs written as well as spin-offs and sequels) and it shuns some of its characters at points, but the package is still one of the best Playstation outings of all time, and every gamer should pick up and play Final Fantasy VII at least once.","summary":"One of the Finest RPG Outings","unixReviewTime":1221350400,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}
{"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"09 8, 2008","reviewerID":"A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","asin":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","reviewText":"Seriously, it's 2008, why am I reviewing this game so long after it came out? Well, because I want to.  So there.  Anyway, this game is marvelous; I still replay it every once in awhile, and it never gets old for me.  You'd think I'd get sick of it after awhile, but I notice and appreciate something new each time I play it.  I personally think this game has aged pretty well, and I'll continue to play it until my discs break in half.  Warning: This review can be considered to contain SPOILERS!(Well, mostly just in the \"story\" section).\n\nGraphics (10\/10): Well, by today's standards, the graphics aren't so good.  However, for their time, they deserved a 10 out of 10.  There's something about seeing a character in 3-D (albeit rather blocky 3-D) that helps you identify more easily with the characters, and even though we now have such advanced graphics with current gen systems, I still find FF7 completely playable and not too hard on the eyes.\n\nMusic (10\/10):  What can I say?  The music in this game is both evocative and distinctive.  The music fits the scenes and conveys mood very well.  This is especially true of the overworld music-I feel like the world really is in dire straights whenever I hear it.  And let me tell you, the first time I heard One-Winged Angel, it put the fear in me (consequently, I died and had to try again - ha ha!).  Anyway, I loved this game's music so much I had to buy the soundtrack!\n\nCharacters (10\/10): Wow.  Characters are excellently portrayed; they all have personalities and some kind of backstory.  Even Yuffie.  I mean, after playing a certain recent FF (12, cough), I've really come to appreciate the fact that no character in FF7 is just tacked on to the party (cough, FF12's Penelo, cough).  Every single character has a backstory that's relevant or ties into the main story in some way.\n\nStory (10\/10): Wow.  That's all I can say.  FF7 has an amazing intricate network of subplots and character histories on top of the main story.  I love the complexity of it.  However, the one drawback to this complex story is that it requires multiple playthroughs and some thought before you catch everything.  To me though, this makes the game better, not worse.  Also, the pacing of the story is excellent.  I never felt bored or compelled to continue \"just to reach the end\".\n\nPlus, I love the fact that your main character, Cloud, has a flawed memory (spoiler, I know, but who doesn't know the story of FF7 by now?).  Because you see the events of the game through his eyes, you never quite know what actually happened, and  what is the product of his confusion. I believe that having a less than 100% reliable narrator makes for a much more interesting story for the player because it keeps you guessing.  Loads of RPGs feature narrators\/main characters with some sort of amnesia, but this is one of the few games I've seen that that actually puts a large focus on \"unreliable narration\". Some people have complained that FF7's story is confusing and poorly told, but I strongly disagree.  Stories in literature that feature \"unreliable narration\" (Edgar Allen Poe used this alot; he doesn't catch any flak for it!) are completely legitimate ways of telling a story.  In the case of Final Fantasy 7, it serves to let the player know (in a dynamic and creative way) that Cloud is possibly psychologically unstable. If you pay attention to the game (you might need multiple playthroughs to catch it), you can figure out what's really going on.  This is in direct contrast to a game that just has a crap story and doesn't make any sense because of poor writing (for an example of this sort of game, see my Grandia III review).\n\nBattle System (10\/10): Once again, I have no complaints here.  I absolutely love menu-driven combat (I know you all are going to laugh at me, but I can't be the only one who likes turn-based stuff).  I love the materia system-it allows for some good customization, which I enjoyed.  In many ways, the materia system is awesome because it allows you to use any character to do anything, which means that no one character is so worthless that you just never use them (with the possible exception of Aeris, since her attack is so low).\n\nGameplay (10\/10): This is my catch-all category. The game is just chock full of extras and side-quests.  Plenty to explore and accomplish.  The side-quests are a good balance of combat related things (like destroying the Weapon monsters) and more relaxing non-combat things (like racing and breeding chocobos).  The controls are easy to use and are rather intuitive.  I really have no complaints.\n\nOverall (10\/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score. Personally, I cannot recommend this game enough.  I realize that it looks rather dated by today's standards, but it's what's inside that counts, right?  The core of this game is still gold.  FF7 is like a fine piece of literature-it may be old but it's still a classic.","summary":"Why am I reviewing this so long after it came out?","unixReviewTime":1220832000,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

It features over 60 hours of gameplay, with an amazing storyline. You can play with 9 charaters in the game, with two (Yuffie and Vincent) being hidden. It also has one of the best soundtracks. Yet the new, \"original\" soundtrack partly ruined it. Yet that would be for another review.\n  Many people complain that there has to be something bad about the game. Saldy there is, yet it's self explanatory. The only real problem is the games graphics. For example, some parts of a charcters arm look like boxes. Yet we can't forget the age of this game.

{"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"01 4, 2007","reviewerID":"A1ZX4B566H5BCN","asin":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"fallowstarz","reviewText":"Although this game is frequently criticized for featuring \"angsty characters\" and a large number of anime and video game cliches, critics of this game's plot should consider that fan perception of the originality of this game has been lessened considerably by the future inclusion of similar character and plot dynamics in the final fantasy series, particularly in FFVIII and FFX. This video game features truly incredible storytelling, and this game should be called cinematic not just because of the inclusion of FMV, but because of the large number of visual metaphors expressed in the game's visual direction. Consider the parallel between the stars in the game's opening and the sparks Aerith watches shooting out of the open electrical panel, or the fact that Midgar's poor literally live underneath its rich. The low-polygon-count 3-D presentation of this game gives it a visual style which emphasizes the geometric nature of objects, and the producers of the game have changed a technical limitation into a stylistic enhancement. The game's usage of light and dark, squalor and cleanliness, gloom and beauty, give it a literary theme of naturalism, by representing the products of human technology as ugly. The sweeping \"theme of Final Fantasy VII\", which compliments the wide-open world map prior to the summoning of Meteor, is first hinted at in \"Holding my Thoughts in My Heart,\" which plays at the precipice of the dystopian technopolis of Midgar. The game's various themes communicate the producers' vision of which environments represent hell, and which represent heaven. Even the ironic real-life double-meaning of \"finding the promised land\" is parallelled in the game by Shinra's misinterpretation of the religion of Aerith's race. The game spends a lot of time exploring the identities of the characters of Cloud, Aerith, Tifa and Sephiroth through dreams, memories, and hallucinations, and rather than including definitive, conclusive scenes in which the whole truth of the characters are revealed, the game challenges you, much like a David Lynch film, to discover the reality of various events by logically reconciling the various perspectives from which they are viewed. This is \"angsty storytelling\" at its most beautiful, as it challenges the players to make an effort to understand the characters, much in the same ways that the game designers would probably like to see more interpersonal understanding within humanity.\n\nThis game improved upon the limit breaks of FF6, which could only be used by deliberately keeping the characters at dangerously low HP levels, by adding the limit bar, and the barrier and mbarrier bars also made combat more interesting, leading many players to wonder why they were subsequently removed from the series. Some minor design flaws in this game include the three-character limit in battle, which reduces the player's ability to diversify the roles of the heroes, and leads the player, on a logical level, to wonder why the other heroes are unable to participate. Also, the overavailability of gil makes purchasing weapons and items too easy, and minimalizes the usefulness of alternate methods for party growth, such as stealing weapons and items.\n\nIf the battles as a whole seem too easy in this game, it is because the game was designed with the intention of challenging the player to experience it, rather than challenging the player to get through it. The game is filled with a variety of fun methods for winning battles, from high-powered summons to enemy skills, and some otherwise difficult boss battles become unloseable after equipping a specific accessory. Part of the coolness of this game is the fact that it was the first major RPG to allow the players to develop extremely poweful heroes, by combining abilities such as auto-resurrection, auto-haste, multiple counter attacks, mp absorbtion, and much more. In other words, the lack of challenge is largely deliberate, and designed to give the players freedom to choose which resources to throw at a particular battle, rather than forcing the players to throw everything they have at most battles in order to have a chance for victory. The inessential-but-fun nature of the sidegames, such as snowboarding and chocobo-breeding, mirrors the inessential-but-fun nature of the majority of the special abilities in this game which may be used during battle.\n\nFF VII must also be commended for the distinctively unique visual design of every dungeon and section of the map. Walking on the snowy north continent of the overworld, leaving footprints in the snow, feels completely different than walking in the shadow of Midgar, and getting lost in previously-unexplored environments, such as the chaotically-mapped Great Glacier, is more of a pleasure than an annoyance. Experimenting with different characters and weapons is fun in this game, and this is complimented by visual touches which were unique to this game at the time of its release, such as showing a different weapon in the battle character model's hand, depending on what is equipped.\n\nI played FFI, FFIV, and FFVI before this game, and on my first playthrough of FFVII, I mourned the absence of some elements included in FFVI, such as multi-party battles, and FFVI's non-linear second act, but in time, I came to realize that in terms of characterization and presentation, FFVII is the quintessential Final Fantasy game.","summary":"Ahead of its own time in graphics; ahead of our current time in fun, immersive storytelling","unixReviewTime":1167868800,"vote":"2","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

The Final Fantasy series in general is probably my favourite series of games (awaiting XII eagerly), and VII is the best of all.\n\nWhat makes it the best?  It has to be the plot, which by gaming standards is superb, the angst driven main character is overdone in RPG's but it works to good effect here.  Sephiroth is another reason, he is the best bad-guy in a game ever, he is just pure evil.  He causes the plot to be more unpredictable than your average RPG, who honestly expected him to kill Aeris, when they first played through?  Main characters rarely die in these sort of games.  It is just a joy to play in every sense, the mini games compliment it well, including in the Gold Saucer.

I mean at first I wasn't into the plot(I started getting sucked into it as soon as I got to Disc 2)and the game aswell but after a few hours of playing I WAS HOOKED, now as I stated before I am not an RPG gamer but this game had one of those really cool anime\/type plots and the turned base battles were pretty cool.  The gameplay was pretty fun and I was always excited to see were the game would take me next, the dialoug IF YOU ASK me was a little dumb, I mean just because Barret is african american every most of the things he says has to always be spelled differently and have 4 letter words?  Ok I'm done gripping.  Other then Plot and gameplay, I really liked how the materia\/magic worked aswell as the summons(man they are such a treat to look at).  And I think I'm going abit too far but I thought the CG scenes(though very limited in the game)were beautiful.  As for visuals, I don't see why people are saying this games visuals are terrible this game was made back in the mid 90's!!!  I thought the visuals were great!  And the pre rendered backrounds were great aswell!  Stop complaining it's an old game!\n\nNow audio....I kid you not, after beating this game I downloaded almost every song from the game(Cosmo Canyon is by far one of my favorite songs ever played on a video game!!!).  The music is just beautiful, the song played in cosmo canyon is let alone a reason to get the game sountrack as well as the final battle with Sepheroth.  The best part about the audio is they fit perfectly well for every scenario\/area\/battle.  I do plan on buying this games soundtrack when I have the time..\n\nNow being my first RPG I don't know what to expect but I'll say it anways..my first time through this game was pretty long, I never went through EVERY SIDE QUEST but I did do a few cause I was a little paranoid that I'd mess up, from random battles to leveling up, Boss battles to getting to every place\/land\/cave that I went through to progress through this great game and my length went down to a total of 57 hours, so yes you bet your sweet keester that your first time through this game will take awhile, as it is spanning 3 discs.

So if you have only played this game I suggest you try the other Final Fantasy's that have been released.\n\nIf the intro made you mad then I'm sure that the rest of the review will make you happy. Starting out as a former member of \"Soldier\" you take the main role of Cloud. You start out with a rebellion group by the name of AVALANCHE and don't forget it. Your inaugural mission is to blow up the reactor to get the attention of \"Shinra Inc.\" to let them know they are ruining the planet by having these mako reactors. So make your point, grab your huge sword and let the adventure begin.\n\nStory 10\n\nEvery body who has played this game knows that the story line is what makes FFVII live up to its title. You are an ex SOLDIER member and joined a group called AVALANCE to stop Shinra (the bad guys) from using all the energy from the planet. WHY?! Because stealing stuff from the planet is not good, that's why. On your way from destroying a mako reactor (steals energy), you run into a pretty flower girl. That whose name I will not say, it's a secret. One of your beginning characters is Barret who is the leader of Avalanche, and with him is Tifa who runs the bar they all hide at, and she also watches his daughter Marlene. Cloud use to live with Tifa in their town called Nibelheim, surprised to see Cloud she runs up to him and asks him how he has been over the past 5 years since they have seen each other.\n\nStarting out kind of fast you will notice the game makes a more pace able progress in the story line. The story isn't as long as \"Xenogears\", but at least you will understand what is going on if you might happen to miss something earlier. Even on my 10th or so time going through the game I still just go through for the story and the game play, but for the most part the story. You have a main villain of course and he goes by the name of Sephiroth. You will meet all kinds of exciting characters and go to new towns that are perfectly designed. Like any other story there are sad times and the good times, but we all want to remember the good times. As we all know the story is one of the best and it keeps you coming back for more. If they just made this game a book, it would definitely be on the top 10 list in no time. That is how good the story is, it's hard to put into words how much you should like it. So just enjoy and move on with the game.\n\nGame Play 10\n\nThe battling system is as normal as any other Final Fantasy. You attack the enemy they attack you, heal, and use magic, all of those good things. At least they don't have the same boss music over and over. Some of the bosses even have dialog in your battles, nothing too major just a grunt or two about how they don't like you and they think that they are going to win the battle. The magic is the basic elements plus your non elementals. There are summons to use which have extraordinary graphics, and a lot of them are just cool looking. The bosses have certain types of skills that you can use by getting a certain \"Materia\" called enemy skill, all you have to do is wait for them to use the move and your character absorbs the move into there little Materia for later use. The Materia is what contains your magic and special techniques. It can have magic all the way to your little friends called the summons. Each of the first couple of summons they are elemental too, such as Ifrit, he is a fire based monster. Along with Shiva whom is an Ice based monster. They all have their own special \"move\" that will help you in each of your battles.\n\nThere is also a little feature called Limit Breaks. So if you ever get tired of using summoning's or using magic use one of these. When that little red bar fills up you use that limit skill and blow those enemies away. Each character has 4 levels limit breaks except for one of them. And when you do a certain amount of using one limit you can get the next extravagant limit. With the first 3 levels of limit breaks there are two in each one. But the forth level of limits is the ultimate which you might have to work you're butt off to get that special item. So there is a lot to keep up with in the game play, make sure you don't forget to check for items hidden in secret places, when it comes to fighting every item you find will help.\n\nGraphics 9\n\nBeing the best graphics of this time of gaming, FFVII tops it all. To start off the characters have no mouths which is ok at least its better than having no faces at all like \"The Grand Stream Saga\". But we will continue on with this game. The magic has ok graphics at the beginning but as you get stronger magic the graphics glint every where all over the screen. Each element of magic (Fire, Thunder, Earth, Ice are the major ones) has 3 levels, and each graphic is bigger each time and can grow even larger when you're fighting multiple enemies and use it on all of them. The summoning's probably are the better detailed of graphics when it comes to battles. There are sixteen bundles of joy waiting for you in the wonderful world out there. Each one you summon has there own special element or non-element attack when you summon them.\n\nThe graphics can be very beautiful the first hundred times that you summon them but after a while they can get exasperating of seeing them do the same thing over and over again. Now on to the videos, each video is really greatly detailed. The characters and the surroundings are spectacular, they have mouths in the videos, they actually move to the words but you don't hear them unfortunately. You can tell they tried not to get too detailed with the characters so they wouldn't look nothing like they do in the game, but they basically paint the picture for what they would look like if the game had better graphics. The Limit breaks as I mentioned earlier have really sole graphics for each one of them. The limits seem to actually fit the characters look, such as cloud he will use his sword and completely ruin everything around him. Barret will use his \"handgun\", to blow away the enemies with ammunition. Each character has graphics to go with them and fit their attitude, and Square really did a good job emphasizing on their details. With ever bit of effort they put into the graphics they really deserve all of the love from everyone.\n\nSound 10\n\nOne of Nobuo Uematsu's best works in music ever. This is definitely a buy worthy soundtrack. If you do not own the game or the soundtrack, I suggest you save up some money and get both of them right after you get through reading my review. Each song fits with the surroundings perfectly, the best part is when you listen to the song by itself then it will remind you of when you were in that specific area or a certain video in the game. I believe if music can do that than it is how the title \"music\" is deserved. While talking about the music the sounds that characters and monsters make are special in their own way too. Unfortunately as I mentioned earlier the characters talk in videos but there is no sound. So pft to them! But I am sure that you can tell from the dialog when the character may be excited or very angry.\n\nThe magic and summons have sounds to them also. When you have a larger leveled magic the sound lasts longer. Because the bigger the magic the longer it takes to finish its use. Each of the summons makes a noise when they perform their duties. Such as when Ifrit sets out his meteor fire ball I am sure you can imagine the big explosion noise that gargantuan rock lets out. When you use items they make noises too, nothing special though just a nice little ring to let you know that you have used it I guess. When you fill up your limit break bar it makes a noise to let you know you're ready to use it, but if the sound doesn't let you know I'm sure the bright flash of fire around your character should get your attention. Every little noise you should notice and remember the rest of your measly life. If you don't then I guess you're not as big of a loser you thought you were now huh. So to Nobuo I thank you for giving us this wonderful piece of art you call the FFVII soundtrack. I am sure that everyone would agree with me.\n\nStory 10\n\nGame play 10\n\nGraphics 9\n\nSound 10\n\nOverall rating 10!!!!!!\n\nIf you haven't figured it out by now, you need to go out and play this game. Do what you have to, and make sure you go through the whole thing and enjoy yourself. A lot of people will tell you this game is over rated. Even if it is so what, it's a good game and that is all that matters. While mentioning this great FF title I suggest that you try some of the older titles that are great too, such as FFIII or FF the original. This is one of the best series of games out there and if you haven't heard of it yet then you need to have a better source of information for games. So go out and play this you will love it! I bet when you find a penny on the ground you will be thankful it helped you buy this game.","summary":"One of the best but not the best","unixReviewTime":1122940800,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons, but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite, but one can't forget One Winged Angel, which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.\n\nBut my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future.","summary":"An excellent game in all areas","unixReviewTime":1118534400,"vote":"2","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

One, to experience the game that it is again and again....this game never gets old or boring....EVER. I'll be 80 years old and I would turn to this game to play it instead of helping the wife find her dentures.\nThe second reason is because I am currently in a play-through of this game that I intend to make the absolute PERFECT file....and I am actually 2 Chocobracelets and 1 Precious Watch away from doing so.\n\nBy perfect (and I could go on forever here, since it took me forever without cheating whatsoever to achieve perfection) I mean EVERY ITEM, (Vagyrisk Claw, Earth Mallet, Fourth Bracelet, Behemoth Horn, or Umbrella anyone? Those are just a few of the rarest items int he game) ALL AVAILABLE MATERIAS (set up on all 8 characters with the perfect combination so you can go into any and all battles, press attack once or cast Knights of the Round once, put the controller down, and go take a leak while the game beats itself)\nAlso, I have 99 of all the items possible to have 99 of....except some of the weapons and armor....you don't really need 99 Gold bangles or 99 W-Machine guns....one of each weapon and 8 of each armor will suffice....one for each character.\nAnd lastly, and this is the hardest and most important to achieve- 255 status of EVERY possible stat- Strength, Speed, Luck, Vitality, Spirit, and Magic....I've spent over 600 hours alone in the crashed Gelnika morphing enemies for the sources to max out my stats....and it is no easy task....you'll need to morph about 170 Unknown 1's for Power Sources PER CHARACTER, 210 Poodlers for Speed Sources PER CHARACTER, 230 Bad Rap's for Luck Sources PER CHARACTER, 170 Unknown 2's for Guard Sources PER CHARACTER, 180 Serpents for Mind Sources (the hardest one to obtain) PER CHARACTER, and 170 Unknown 3's for Magic Sources....PER CHARACTER. So in the end you're looking at morphing over 9,000 enemies....fun fun fun....but if you're dedicated (or insane, whatever you like) like me....it can be done.\n\nI love this game so much, and am so dedicated from all these years, I could go into a boss battle stripped of all materia and weapons and armor and not take a hit....and win the battle with ease. 255 Luck evades all enemy hits on me.... 255 Strength guarantees a hell of a hit on the enemy in retaliation for even thinking they can touch me. Not to mention the 255 Speed....allowing me to get in sometimes 2 or 3 hits on the enemy before they can even notice who just killed their pathetic a$$....hehe\n\nGraphics, sound, playability, controls....etc....all 10 out of 10.\n\n[...]\nDon't miss out on the experience that is Final Fantasy 7!!!","summary":"8 years old and still ticking....","unixReviewTime":1107216000,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Continue on to hear details that I remember from FF7.\n\nThe music was amazing.  The music from many battles, where Cloud, the main character, faces enemies that are \"in his way\", let's put it, is very powerful and makes your heart race.  Orchestrated, how would you say, music composed from a symphonic orchestra, just pure classical music--THROUGHOUT the entire game!  It's great!  One of the many strong points in this game.\n\nCloud, the main character, starts off in a large, urbanized city, which you will see once you start the game, once you get off the train with that big muscular guy your with.  This huge city you're in is defiantly humungous, it really is; skyscrapers, apartments, high rise buildings and smokestacks, it's impressive I'm telling you, and, you guessed, you're going to have to explore the whole city in this adventure!  There will be instances where Cloud meets friends in different places as you progress through the game--apartments, hospitals, high-rise towers.\n\nThe story is very real with characters that respond like in real life.  For example, I was playing a quarter of the way through the game, where we (Cloud, other dude, a couple other of Cloud's friends) had to walk up many flights of stairs to the top of this monstrously tall building---Cloud's friend gets tired of going up the whole stairway, \"how much longer do we have to go\".  That was when Cloud had to face another chaotic enemy, this time on the exterior elevator--hey it's challenging, but at least you get a good view of the city from a 1,000 feet up!.....Another instance is where, in this large scientific industry, Cloud falls off a bridge (not a bridge, just an overpass to walk on), 500 feet up in the air, with his girlfriend shouting for help---a very great movie sequence that I recall vividly.\n\nObviously, I remember FF7 very well, because this game is like a movie that you, as Cloud, progress through, with obstacles, battles, conflict, even love scenes with Cloud and his girlfriend (don't worry--that's nothing compared to today's standards). I tell you, without the enthralling and emotional, orchestrated music, this game would not be so great.  But the FF7 has it...music that is very suitable for the battleground, hideous situations, emotional moments, and many more instances.\n\nOverall, this game is spectacular and it will leave an impression on you.  This game is that good, and I'm telling you, you definitely need to get this game!","summary":"Vivid Memories of FF7","unixReviewTime":1097884800,"vote":"4","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

And FF7 just might be the best game ever made for it. FF7 defined what an RPG should be, with an intricate storyline, characters with attitude, an addictive battle system, and everything else that makes an RPG worth playing. This is what RPGs should look, play, and feel like, but it seems like none are as good as this one. The action starts from the very beginning, starting with a terrorist group called AVALANCHE on their way to destroy a power plant called a Mako Reactor, which sucks the life out of the planet in order to provide the people of the city Midgar with electricity. These Reactors are spread across the world, and AVALANCHE's main goal is to destroy all of them to save the planet. However, a creation of the Shinra, Inc. company has come back to haunt them: a humanoid creature named Sephiroth, who takes his Mako-filled disfigured mother to find the Promised Land and destroy the planet. Then, Cloud, a shallow character with a mysterious past, and his team must pursue Sephiroth in order to save the planet. The storyline then gets even more exciting as other problems arise, but you'll have to play to figure it out.

The exception to the graphics comes in the fairly cool looking occasional movie scenes. Not being a huge RPG fan, I took the fairly direct route through the game. RPG extremists have a ton more to do, from raising chocobos to fighting that (expletive deleted) Ruby Weapon. Also, the special attacks are really cool.

It's a big part of the reason Sony overtook Nintendo and ultimately won the 64-bit chapter of the console wars. And, truth be told, it's single handedly responsible for reviving a passion for video games that had lain dormant within me for years. So, cutting to the chase, is it worth the hype, does it really measure up to those previously mentioned, simplistic, cherished classics of the 8-bit era, can it really be as good as it's been portrayed? Well, yes and no. Final Fantasy VII is not the best game I've ever played, period. What it is... well, it's easily in the top five.\nThe story basically throws players into the fast lane right off the bat. The opening video montage leads directly into a late-night raid on the planet's largest governing body, the Shinra, a raid in which the player is actively a part. As events unfold, the point becomes clear; you're a mercenary, aiding a terrorist organization in their efforts to destroy a significant portion of the city to make a point that the Shinra cannot ignore. Five minutes into the game and already it's covered more mature material than the previous six combined. Make no mistake, Final Fantasy VII is not a game you'll want to hand your six year old to help him pass some time in front of the TV. Not only does it cover some rough psychological terrain (mortality, semitism, terrorism and political espionage are discussed, in depth, and confronted... just to name a few) but the characters and dialog themselves aren't nearly as squeaky clean as they were in previous installments.\nWith that said, the in-game visuals of FF7 are very much lacking, especially in comparison to later titles. This was obviously a very early release for the rugged PSone. Edges were extremely jaggedy, especially so when not in a battle, live renderings of the characters left a lot to be desired and even the cutscenes themselves were compressed poorly, leaving huge artifacts all over the glorious video renderings. In sharp contrast, though, the animation and design of the hundreds of different enemies, players, items and boss characters is amazing, and the variety of static, immovable backgrounds are superbly concepted, executed and presented.\nTo a much lesser degree than the visuals, the musical score is undermined by the medium in which it's been presented. This is a soundtrack that would have shaken the earth if it were performed by a master orchestra. Unfortunately, the difference between a symphonic performance of these classic songs and the spotty, digitized portrayal that shipped with FF7 is as large as the difference between the sketches of the characters themselves and their eventual presentation on-screen. Sure, you'll recognize them without a second glance... but they've been crammed into a format that really can't do them any justice.\nAs has been the case with each new chapter in the Final Fantasy legacy, one new tweak has been thrown into the mix, in this case going under the name \"materia.\" As the game progresses, you'll find these colorful blocks of concentrated energy (be it on the body of a defeated enemy, alone in a cave somewhere or for sale in a shop) that grant the holder magical abilities. They're the only way to upgrade your characters' abilities, and are completely interchangeable between the members of your party. By equipping a block of materia and then defeating enemies, the magic \"levels up\" and gains new abilities while simultaneously strengthening its previous benefits. Each weapon and bit of armor you find throughout the game has a slot for the employment of materia, which effectively limits the number of them you can use at any one time. You'll eventually need to make some tough choices over which materia to develop and which to ignore.\nA lot of players have voiced a strong dislike for the materia system, claiming it kills the variety of your characters. The common consensus says that by giving the player the ability to assign any skill or spell to any character, Square has basically given you a bunch of clones with which to do battle. I'd have to disagree. If you really want to nitpick and pay attention to the specifics of each character's stats like that, you'll notice that each character has a different affinity to the various materia commands in the world. Sure, you can give anybody in your party the ability to cast \"fire,\" but it's going to cause more damage if you give it to someone with an inherently high magic ability. Square's kept the variety in this cast, they've simply given you the ability to ignore each character's strengths and sculpt an army on your own accord.\nThe theory behind Final Fantasy VII is outstanding, yet simple: create a game with an untouchable story, tremendous characters, amazing design, mouth watering special effects and great musical accompaniment. It was the right game with the right pop culture appeal at the right moment. It accomplished every single one of its goals, and it's going to win \"best video game ever\" polls from now until the end of time because of it. What it won't win, though, is a perfect ten from yours truly. While I'd be more than happy to go so far as to say the story contained herein is the best of all the Final Fantasy games, I can't say the same for most of the other aspects of the game. The visuals and audibles are hampered by the PSone's own internal limitations, the characters are topped by those of FF8, and the mini games make me shake my head more than they entertain me. This is very, VERY close to perfection, but I've admittedly played a few titles that are better","summary":"Legend, but not Perfection","unixReviewTime":1088553600,"vote":"20","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Allen Jr.","reviewText":"I being a veteran of videogaming, have to say I'm very dissapointed in the recent reviews bashing this game. Final Fantasy VII is what made RPG gaming what it is today.\nThat being said, this game now well beyond its' years is still the best RPG I have ever played. Close to being the best game ever. By todays standards, the graphics are horrid, but couldn't have been done better. Very colorful and every part of this game was a refreshing look at something new. Your charachter goes from a centrally located city, to fortified town, to a beach resort, to an amusment park and so on and so on. At one point you end up in outerspace. There is to much to describe in a review, lets just say there is plenty to see and do.\nThe gameplay is rediculously addictive. The materia gems were a good idea. Being able to fit elemental materia to weapons and armor allowed for great flexability. Combo certain materia together and your charachter could attack from two to eight times in one turn. The junction system in FF 8 is based on the materia system. Those who perfer 8 over 7 should compare and see that they are in fact fairly similar. Changing materia in mid-battle would have been nice in case of an attack that heals instead of hurting, takes one or more members of the attack team out of action.\nThe amount of mini games is the most ever for any FF. the amusment park has an arcade and rides. A battle arena to compete for really good prizes. You can bet on, race and breed chocobos. The amount of things to do is astounding. The sidequest are fun and can help your party if you complete them. One could easily get lost and forget about the main story.\nThe story is not the greatest, but it held my intrest when I first played FF7. You never really take it seriously until one of your party members is killed 1\/3 way in the game. The true enemy of this game is a cold blooded man with destruction and death left in his wake. The corporate enemy is nothing more than sidetracking cannon fodder for you to level up with. I guarentee a sense of satisfaction when finally putting the last boss away,for anything else, just for revenge would be motive enough. All charachter development is well done but a little awkward at times. Trying to make this story serious and funny at the same time, often leaves players wondering where the story is headed. For the most part, no complaints about the story. It's told with the player in mind. Trying to find a way to connect with the player.\nThe musical score fits this game. Only FF6 (FF3 in the states) is done better. At no point in this game does the music not fit the scenario the player is currently traveling.\nThis game got a lot of publicity during its arrival and rightfully so. A magnificent piece of not only gaming, but art. Every RPG made after FF7 is based on what this game revolutionized. RPG before this were all 2D and pretty much cookie cutter RPG. This game literally changed RPG into what it is now, I hope those who recently bought this game at least attempt to finish it to gain the games' beauty as a whole. Those who had this game from the beginning already know that Final Fantasy VII is not only a great game, but arguably PSX best of all time.

FFVII was released in 1997, became possibly the best-selling RPG ever, has been lauded by most critics for years, and this is 2004. I think the ship of destiny has sailed.\nAnyway, I love this game. I have played it multiple times, and while it isn't my favorite FF title (that honor is shared by FFVI and FFVIII), it holds a special place in my heart. I read in the spotlight above that one reviewer gave up on the game because Aeris died; this seems odd (I mean, really, these are only video game characters, and can someone really get worked up that much over the merely-physical death of a single heroine?). I myself found this a bit silly (characters get killed all the time in RPGs; didn't Cloud have a Phoenix Down on hand?), but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the game. The gameplay, the sidequests, the graphics (for their time), the Chocobos - all come together quite well in this title. I particularly enjoyed the frustration (and ultimate satisfaction) of defeating Emerald and Ruby, and the storyline is OK as well.

Gone were the traditional top-down viewpoints, the 1-dimensional characters, and the boring spell effects, and we watched in amazement at hitherto-unparalleled graphics and a completely revolutionary storyline showed us exactly how good a RPG could be. Winning legions of new fans over to the genre, FF 7 fully deserved it's blockbusting, best-selling status.\nFF 7 follows the story of Cloud Strife, a young mercenary-for-hire, and his attempts to stop his ex-colleague and nemesis Sephiroth from destroying the world. Along the way he meets some memorable characters, makes friends and discovers who he truly is.\nThe strongest selling point of FF 7 at the time of it's release was the graphics, which today, understandably, have been surpassed several times over. However, some moments in the game still hold their own against the modern consoles, and for a seven year-old game, that's no small feat. What remains today is one of the best storylines ever, coupled with some of the smoothest game mechanics in videogaming history.\nThe emotion behind the characters of Aeris, Cloud, Sephiroth etc., is something which games developers have only recently started to latch on to - for example, 'Silent Hill 2' and 'Fatal Frame' go deep into the psychology of emotion - but in a character and story-driven game like FF 7, the depth of attachment we form with the characters is simply amazing. It's impossible to treat FF 7 as a piece of retro-gaming, such is the depth of development behind the storyline. It tackles subjects like political upheaval, religion, self-worth - and does it all in such a way as to force us to mentally attach ourselves to the little people running about on the screen.\nThe gameplay, too, is superb, with an easy menu system and full in-game tutorials being accessible at pretty much any point in the game. The difficulty level is pitched exactly right, there's a steady learning curve and monsters and battles become significantly harder as you progress, but not so hard as to be prohibitive. Puzzles and secrets abound, and each time you play (and you WILL play it multiple times) you discover several new features that you didn't see before. With typical Square finnesse, the game options are customisable so battles and cut-scenes don;t have to take up too much time, and the whole game moves at a speed which you, the player, dictate.\nI can't rave enough. Possibly equalled in terms of absorbing entertainment only by it's own sequels, FF 7 is still a rewarding, hugely entertaining, and very special game. Totally recommended.","summary":"The Best","unixReviewTime":1075507200,"vote":"2","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

However, this game offers so much more than what a quick glance can give.  The characters' graphics may not be fully detailed, but their personalities and body language make up for all of that.  Each character was thoughtfully created with unique story, background,\nand demeanor.  Unlike many of the Final Fantasy games, one does not get to know the villan as well as the mighty Sephiroth on Final Fantasy VII.  I hated him, yet felt sorry for him at the same time. To make it an even more intriguing game along side of the story-line and character development, the battle system was well constructed.  The Materia system allowed the player to equip Materia, (magic) to their weapons.  (Certain weapons had more Materia slots than others)  When some Materia is linked together such as -All- and -Lighting- it can create an overall attack on all the enemies versus just one. Though some may debate that the graphics sucked, one has to understand that this game came out in 1997.  Graphics six years ago were bound to be worse than what they are now.\nPros: Characters that were deeply thought out and well woven into the plot\nA fun and addicting battle system\nSeveral mini-games and great incentives for winning\nChocobo breeding and racing\nCons: Graphics may bother those that are use to newer games\nOverall, this game has so much to offer.  I am always tempted to replay it because of things I missed, such as getting Cloud's final limit break Omnislash or beating Ruby and Emerald Weapon.  Just twenty minutes into the game, I was hooked.  It was the first RPG I had ever played and ever since I loved the genre.\nFinal Fantasy VII is worth all the Five Stars I give, because I believe it set the standard to the RPGs to follow.","summary":"Sets the Standard For All Games!","unixReviewTime":1070150400,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

All we ever here from those that 'hate' the game is, \"bad graphics, bad storyline, bad gameplay\".  To be quite honest, one should not be writing a review on a game if one does not state reasons why the game is in fact, so good, or so bad.  If you are trying to persuade someone to not like a game, then give the facts WHY something stinks, just don't say it does.  Filling games with bad reveiws just gives a bad rap for no reason, for all of you who didn't in fact like this game, fill out a review with enough detail to describe what made the game so bad.\nAnyways, enough about bad reviews.  This is the first game i played when i got my very first playstation so long ago when they were just coming out.  I wasn't a gamer then, but this game turned me into one.  Final Fantasy 7 must be the best game i have ever played.  If you think about it, the games graphics were amazing considering the time it was introduced.  I am still amazed today with the battle effects and cut scenes.  Simply exceptional.  The gameplay, well, to say in short, is wonderful.  The game does an excellent job drawing the player into the storyline, and making the player FEEL like he or she is part of the game.  I must have replayed this game over 30 times, each time finding new things.  The FMV sequences are amazing, and cannot be beaten.  There are too many people that state the game has bad graphics; the final fantasy series in itself has always had a cartoonish side to things, so i do not understand why anyone would say the graphics are bad.  Sure we all have our playstation 2's and saw how amazing Final Fantasy X looked, but keep in mind the time Final Fantasy 7 was brought out.  Also, the music is amazing.  When Aeris died, the situation and music almost made me cry.  Then the battle afterwards, had you so mad, that you felt like pummeling Genova with everything you had.  Which is what most did.\nAnyways, rather than subject this review with every little detail of the game, i will simply state, the game rocks, because it is so innovative, so drawing, and so damn good just plain and simple.  A must have for any gamer.\nFinal Fantasy 7 is still my favorite, even tho i am currently wrapped up in Final Fantasy 11, but thats a different game.\nBy this game and see yourself how wondrous it is.","summary":"Classics Unlimited, Squaresoft Rules the World","unixReviewTime":1068854400,"vote":"2","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

No game before it and no game since then has managed to pull me so deeply into the story and have me hanging on every word like this one did. The characters, the music, the graphics, the story... it's all golden.\nThe characters are simply unforgettable. Cloud, Aeris, and Yuffie were my favorites of the bunch. Each character has such wonderful design, half realistic half cartoonish, full detailed backgrounds, and such personality and potential to develop that I enjoyed following everyone one of them.\nThe music and graphics sticks in my mind like nothing else. They worked so well together. From simple cut scenes to the most glorious of FMV. And unlike today's games that throw long boring FMV in just for the sake of filling 2 DVDs, this game used FMV to make a point so poetically you couldn't help but feel like you just watched an epic film.\nI wish I could sit here and just ramble on and on about the beautiful story and the twists, turns, and major events, but obviously that would ruin it for any who still haven't played this masterpiece of a game. I see many, many people today who have never played a game like this and are simply enthralled by today's crop of PS2 RPG wanna-be's and it really irks me.

If you are one of those people who simply won't buy anything with a E rating, you probably won't like this game. There's nothing obscene about this game except for some minor swearing and sexually suggestive scenes(no actual nudity). This is not a game to be rushed through at high speeds. To fully enjoy this game, you should delve deep into the hidden aspects of this world and learn more about the story as well as obtaining useful items. Many people are spitting on FFVIII and FFIX, because of this game. In my opinion, FFVII is better only by a very, very, slight margin.\n  Also, I think that there definitely were better games during the time period in which this game came out. Zelda Ocarina of Time was definitely better than FFVII, even though it was shorter, and the revolutionary Goldeneye for N64 is just as good as FFVII.\n  Don't let those comparisons prevent you from buying this game though. In an industry with so many good games to buy,comparison will really get into the way of buying an enjoyable game.

Where FF6 was a 2D game with 16 bit graphics, this one was fully rendered 3D graphics. You move your polygonal character through a richly painted \"mural\" of a world. The sound quality is also much better.\nAlong the way, Cloud is joined by Barret, who looks and talks like Mr. T from the A Team. Tifa Lockheart and Aeris Gainsborough also join him - both are characters that are found on the FF\/Disney blend Kingdom Hearts.\nOf course there is a Wedge and Biggs, named after the Star Wars characters. In fact, one of Biggs' early lines is almost straight from the movie. There's a Cid too - he's an airship pilot. This is the Cid they used in Kingdom Hearts.\nFinally you reach and meet Sepiroth, and his many forms.

I own FFIV,V,VI,VII,VIII,IX, and X and have beaten FFVII,VIII,IX,and X and this one is the best. I have to recommend it to everyone, RPG fan or not. Squaresoft was at it's prime in this period what with FFVII & Xenogears, my favorite Squaresoft games. The battle format is the tried and true Active form (you have a \"Active Time Battle\" gauge that fills and when it fills, the character can attack. Enemies don't have to wait for you to use your turn to use theirs). There are tons of commands (Ex. Attack, Deathblow, Magic, Item, Morph, Steal, Mime, etc.) but many require Materia to use. Materia is what you insert into your weapon and armors empty Materia slots to gain the Materias ability while it is equipped. You gain AP as well as EXP and Gil ($) after winning a fight. AP levels up your equipped Materia. It is important not to overload your character with Materia though, because as Cloud says in a tutorial, \"It acts as a double-sided sword. While it gives you abilities, it also can subtract from your stats.\" The story starts small as a rebel group AVALANCHE fighting the Shinra Corporation that is turning the only huge city on Gaia, Midgar, into one big industrial market. They are putting up Mako Reactors that suck the energy from the Earth and convert it to power. AVALANCHE destroys a couple of these in missions and Shinra devises a plan. 18 year old Cloud is just joining AVALANCHE, but reluctantly; he is very cruel hearted and troubled do to his past in the beginning, but that changes. Quickly the scheme becomes much more grandiose as Sephiroth gets involved. AVALANCHE falls apart and the core members and a few other characters leave to follow Sephiroth, while Shinra searches for \"the Promised Land,\" a land with tons of Mako energy. The story is serious. A main character even dies at the climax of the first disc. It leads you through tons of places and aquaints you with many people. Of course the ever popular Biggs and Wedge return, as does Cid (you may not get this if you aren't big for Final Fantasy games). The Limit Breaks are cool. During battle there is a gauge called Limit Break which fills when you are attacked. When it fills all the way, you can use Limit Breaks which are very strong attacks. You learn new ones by using previous ones or a variety of other ways for certain characters. The status effects such as Poison or Mute are used. The ammount of Materia is staggering. The summons are great, but one stands out as fairly impossible to not be a one hit kill, besides on Safer Sephiroth if he has on Wall, or Emerald and Ruby Weapon regardless. This summon is common knowledge for Final Fantasy enthusiasts, Knights of the Round, where 13 knights attack the enemies. If you have a good magic stat, they do a good 9000 damage per attack (9000 x 13 = 117,000 damage). The graphics are standout awesome for their time, but nowadays they aren't special and the character designs are a disaster, but again, they were awesome back in the days. The sound is top notch with awesome music. Just like Xenogears, it's one of those few games where I like the music. There are a few huge [disappointments] (the chocobo battle music) and a few instant favorites (the Safer Sephiroth music, \"One Winged Angel\"). The game length is about 40-50 hours, but you'll keep playing it to get to level 99 and complete every last side quest (like me!) and clock in 70 hours if you have one ounce of common sense. The control is flawless except for the X for cancel and Circle for confirm, but that can be fixed with the customizable controls very easily. I just can't believe that you're still reading this review! Buy the game already, you won't regret it.","summary":"Final Fantasy?

In this FF, you get to equip stones called materia and use abilities based on what the materia is. And the best part is, after a while, when you bring a materia to its higest level, it will form another materia of the same type. The amount of materia you can equip is based on what weapon you have equipped. And you can improve materia with other materia, on some occassions. There are five different types of materia:\na)Magic Materia: lets your character cast spells\nb)Command Materia: lets you character use commands such as Steal or Enemy Skill (also known as Blue Magic)\nc)Independent Materia: gives your character improved stats or passive abilities\nd)Summon Materia: lets you summon characters such as Ifrit or Shiva\ne)Support Materia: Allows you to add abilities to linked materia\nThere is, however, one slight problem about a certain materia. In this game, there is a Support Materia called Elemental. What this materia does is it adds a connected materia's element(s) to your attack (if equipped on a weapon) or protects you from connected elements (if equipped on armor). The problem comes in play if you equip this to your weapon. If you run into an enemy who is strong against the element(s) that is\/are attached to Elemental, you have no way to change the elemental properties that the weapon currently possesses. So, you may have to start back to your last save point if the situation gets really bad and all you can do is attack.\nThis is the first FF to have \"Limits\". Basically, this lets use a unique, and usually strong, move when you character takes enough damage, so it's kind of like being in a rage. And as you use Limits more and more, you can get more and more different attacks you can use when you reach your Limit Break (when you can use a Limit).\nIf you don't already have FFVII, hurry and get it!

I have played the best with titles such as Grand Theft Auto Vice City, and I have played some of the worst like TOtal Recall.  However throughout all the games that I have played only one stands out as the number one game of all time.  That title is Final Fantasy 7.\nWhat makes Final Fantasy 7 so great, especially considering the past titles, the sequels, and other great titles such as Dragon Warrior Series, BReath of Fire, and so on.  It has a special something that few games really have.  Any game can draw you into a story, hell old NES titles such as Ninja Gaiden and Zelda could do that.  However what makes this so great is that it is one of the select few titles in the relm of video gmaes that can do something that no other games can, but I shall reveal that later.  LEts talk about the game.\nFInal Fantasy 7 starts off like an action movie might.  You control Cloud Strife, an ex-soldier (equivelent to the  NAvy Seals) who is now a mercenary for hire.  He is currently working for the terrorist organization known as Avalanche ran by Barrett, a big burly black man with a chaingun for a hand.  His second in command is a girl named Tifa who was a childhood friend of clouds.  After a few succesful missions cloud is seperated from the team where he meets up with a young girl named Aeris.  Little does cloud realize at first is that Aeris is beign pursued by the conglomerate Shinra (Shinra is what Avalanche is trying to bring down.).  CLoud decideds to help her out but when she is kidnapped he must rescue her.  MEanwhile a ghost from the past returns to not only haunt him, but destroy the world.\nThis is the main focus of the first few hours.  The story itself will slowly evolve into something that if you show dedication to than you will be very satisfied when it is all said and done.  Now lets talk about some technical aspects.\nThe graphics for the time are outstanding, however when compared to today it is proof of how dated graphics can get quickly.\nCOntrols are fluent enough and the menues are asy to scroll through.\nCOmbat is never really one sided however if you don't build up your levels (by the end of Disk one should be level 40 or higher for the whole party) you will be whipped.\nThe music is what seperates this from most games.  The music is the pinacle of greatness here.  As I am writing this I am listening to Aeris Theme which is one of the greatest tracks in gaming history.  This alone seperates this from most gaems past and present.\nHowever there is one factor that seperates this from most games.  The secret to why this one of he best is that it is one of the few games that can touch you emotionally.  Any game can give you an adrenaline rush.  However it is very select few gaems that can touch you emotionally, and even make you cry.  Final Fantasy 7 has accomplished this.  THis is one of the select few titles that has ever done this.  To date the only other title to do this is the cult hit Ico.\nIn conclusion Final Fantasy 7 is the greatest game of all time because it has an incredible story, incredibel music, and the fact that you will be sucked in if you give it time.  But that is the thing, you must give it time and dedication.  This is however the greatest game of all time.","summary":"The Greatest Game of all time","unixReviewTime":1043798400,"vote":"2","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

FFVII is still the greatest RPG of all time, graphically the game shows it's age (circa 1997), and the game play isn't exactly the easy moving\/user friendly style we're used to today, but those so called draw backs don't hinder the awesome story, the great fantasy atmosphere, and the wonderful characters including Cloud, the quiet and reserved hero of the story and of course Sephiroth, who is in my opinion the greatest bad guy gamming has ever seen (any fan of this game knows what I'm talking about). I'm not going to tell you about the story because I don't want to ruin a great experience, just take my word for it, Final Fantasy VII is still my favorite video game of all time and if you give this masterpiece a chance you won't be disappointed.

This game far exceeded my hopes and wishes, impressing me with the 3D characters, the story, the materia system, even the music. It's what rewarded me for waiting and choosing Sony for my new gaming platform. I've been a great fan of their games that followed, especially their landmark success Final Fantasy X for the PS2.\nThe game has an interesting plot, compelling characters, and many challenges and secrets to discover. It also has a few plot twists that add spice. If you haven't played this game or those that have followed, PLEASE start here!

He saw Final Fantasy VII on the shelves and bugged me to get it. So I eventually got it but found he was playing it more than me. So when he wasn't around, I sneaked and played his game and I got so wrapped up in the game I forgot I was still playing his game and he missed some plot elements. But I couldn't contain myself cause this was one of the best games I played, and still do, I'm currently on my 8th play.\n\nStory: Cloud, a former SOLDIER(kind of like an elite squad) member is recruited by Avalanche to help bring down the Shinra Corporation whose reactors are draining the planet of its energy. Where it goes from there involves a being from the sky, genetic experimentation and mind freak-outs.\n\nMusic: Some of the best music ever is on the soundtrack. One track, Aeris's Theme is worth the price of it alone. This song can't be put into words, one of the most beautiful compositions I've ever listened to(and it's played in a sad scene but I won't spoil it). But this soundtrack also included a wide variety of music like rock(Boss Battle Theme)New age sounding(City of the Ancients), funk like(Wall Market) to ominous(Those Chosen By The Planet).\n\nGraphics: Back in 1997, these graphics were jawdropping. That opening sequence with Aeris, the entrance to Gold Saucer, and awakening of ancient beings were just amazing. They seem tame now but back then, they were gorgeous. It isn't flawless though: the characters look \"blocky\" like it'll have a big block for a hand and in some cases, you can see them without a mouth but it doesn't detract from the feel of the game.\n\nAnd one thing to note if you've haven't played a Final Fantasy before, yes it is Part VII but it's not like a saga where each part is a continuation of the story. It's all new story, characters, villains, worlds etc.\n\nFor your spells and abilities, it includes the Materia System. While I'm not gonna spoil what a materia is, the basic function of it is to give you special abilities. Equip it on your weapon or armor and you can cast magic, summon beasts, counterattack, steal or give you some benefits. Master it and it'll create a new one. So awesome materia like Ultima, Knights of the Round or Mime can be replicated, giving you almost an endless string of summons.\n\nIn VI and in VIII, certain special attacks can be accessed when a character was low health. Here it's a bar that fills up whenever you get attacked. Fill it up and you can unleash a string of powerful attacks, one big beam, or even cure party members. One flaw is that regular attacks can't be accessed so you can't save it for an approaching Boss, you either have to use magic or just defend.\n\nThis is one of the best games you'll play and even though there's other games out currently that can distract, it always helps to go back to what started it all: what brought people into the RPG genre in a HUGE way: Final Fantasy VII.","summary":"Best RPG Ever","unixReviewTime":1031529600,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Its the game that made me buy one. Although the game is not without its problems that are irritatingly noticble now (a horrible translation, bad grammer, etc) for its time this game was revolutionary. Square made great use of FMV technology to progress this very anime like story line. FF VII is one of three titles argued to be the best of them (VI, VII and VIII), and is the game that started the RPG revolution that made Playstation what it is today.\n These days this game is sorely dated and this game should be remade using GCN technlogy. I do not believe that they should make it realistic. Idealy I'd like to see them use toon shading in this remake idea to replace the 3D monstosities which were featured in the game originally. The original charcter models were inconsistant and largely overly blocky. However the battle scenes and major FMVs offered a whole lot of anime potential.

GamePro had allready said it may be the greatest game ever made, and that itself is quite a title.  I never really liked RPG's, I'm more of an action gamer, but with all the hype surrounding this game, I figured what the [heck] and rented it a few days after it came out.  I was dumbfounded the first time I played it, I was speachless.  At the time I had never seen graphics like that, and the storyline was so engrossing that I felt a wave of depression actually set over me when I had to take it back.  As pathetic as that sounds, the day I returned it to the video store, I went out and bought Final Fantasy VII and kept playing for days.  Eventually I beat it, then a buddy of mine showed me his strategy guide and I realized I missed a lot of side stuff and extras, so I played through again using the guide, and the experience was even better.  If you have never played any Final Fantasy game before this one is worth picking up, even if you don't like RPG's you'll dig this, though I suggest picking up the BradyGames strategy guide to make the game even sweeter.

What a cliche!  Masterpiece; a term suggesting the undisputed magnum opus of an already venerable company.  Many things gain this mark, but few live up to their expectation.  Final Fantasy 7 does.\nIn many ways, Final Fantasy 7 is far from perfect.  The graphics, compared to today, are dated, grainy, and harsh.  The storyline reeks of cliche-ridden overtones.  The characters seem generic.  However, this is all a product of subsequent games.\nFinal Fantasy 7 defined the 3D graphical engine used in almost all of today's RPGs.  Its characters, still fresh, were very unique, emotionally unstable, and enjoyable to read about.  The storyline spins off numerous tangents and undertones that suggested a fully functioning, realistic world that presents real-life human troubles.\nThis is far from a typical RPG.  From its conception, it redefined the genre and introduced the RPG to about 3 million new gamers.  Saying that Final Fantasy 7 single-handedly elevated RPGs from niche to mainstream status would be far from an erraneous statement.\nConsidering all of these things, a person skeptical about playing Final Fantasy 7 should grant reconsideration.  Though it is far from the prettiest and most unique of games, it does represent the model that all of today's successful RPGs follow.  And, in this case, the model is more radiant than its spinoffs.","summary":"A masterpiece, of its time.","unixReviewTime":1017273600,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

{"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"02 4, 2002","reviewerID":"A1JSPVBO30TFSE","asin":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"Brian Seiler","reviewText":"Let's face it--Final Fantasy VII got the whole thing started again.  Back in the old days of 8-bit consoles and Commodore 64s, when Apple computers wasn't nerd-speak for \"I don't know how to run my machine,\" RPGs were a very narrowly targeted genre with little flavor or flash in them, and as the consoles outpaced the appeal of the text based, graphics poor style, they started to fall out of favor.  It was this game that opened the door for the whole next generation of RPGs and brought the genre into the mainstream, and this game did all those things for very good reasons.\nI'll start with the good, because I feel the need to stress that this is a game you'll probably enjoy.  There are a lot of flaws, but the fact of the matter is that you'll probably only notice them if you go looking for them.  What the game has going for it is a fairly intuitive gameplay interface, a cast of interesting characters, and a story that combines innovation with the same old epic qualities to make a nice, comforting blend.  Those are the most evident qualities this game has, and they outweigh the shortcomings by a long way.\nBut there are shortcomings, they are significant, and they need to be admitted to.  First off, the graphics are just terrible by today's standards.  Forget history--I want to know if this thing's going to look good right now, and this is probably the worst game in the entire series in terms of current presentability.  The CG movies, while impressive, are exceeded with flagrant ease by every other subsequent Square release, the screens are drawn in a fuzzy fashion that gave me a headache if I tried to play for more than two hours in a row, and the game suffers from severe graphical design schizophrenia.  While I have enough imagination to reconcile the blocky, superdeformed character models used through most of the game with the slick, properly proportioned CG figures, that will definitely cause some people trouble.  While this game was certainly visually impressive when it came out, these days it just doesn't cut muster, and you need to keep that in mind when you pick it up (even it's next closest sequel in the series was infinitely better--you WILL notice the graphics problems).\nThis game also can have race issues if you want it to.  If you're overly sensitive about the issue, I'd avoid this title.  Barrett is the only black man in the entire universe, and he's not that complimentary a character.  I don't particularly care--he was supposed to be Mr. T, and he turned out well in that regard, but if you intend to read some kind of general statement on the merit of people of a particular shade, you may as well just let this one pass by.\nThe story is also a problem, contrary to the high praise that die-hard fans often give it.  This story is confusing for no particular reason, and the writers are totally lost in terms of how they want to tell their tale.  I like the characters--tell me what happens to them.  No?  Okay--then I'm saving the world.  So why do I care about this schmo's childhood trauma?  The total effect was that when I got to the end of the game, I felt incredibly shortchanged in terms of story fulfillment, since the characters' significance pretty much takes a nose dive on the third disk.  The story is needlessly complex at points and the major inconsistencies aren't dealt with particularly well (I do not consider a tube of goo an effective address to a plot hole).  While the plot is innovative and epic, it is also confused and meandering, and you may have to play through it twice to figure out what's going on.\nAgain, though, I should stress that these problems aren't going to be too big if you don't want them to be.  These are things that you can ignore very easily while you play through the game.  The gameplay itself ranks among the best balanced ever, with random monster encounters (a BAD idea, but one that every game without Grandia or Chrono in the title seems to stick with) well tailored to the characters' levels and the game remaining appealing and challenging throughout.  This one will appeal to just about anybody, and it should be in any RPG fan's library.","summary":"A wearing classic","unixReviewTime":1012780800,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

When it comes to how they look for 3D I would say \"good\" but for realism (during game play)I dunno. They(Characters and people and things) look...not so good. However, the graphics during battles are very good (also during cut scenes\/movies)\nMusic: 4 stars:Really very good music. I espicially like the battle music and the ancient city\/city of the ancients music. Oh, and the chocobo battle music.\nStory line: 5 stars: very good story line, alot of different things other than Shinra and Sepheroth.\nCharacters:4 stars: I like most of the characters, except for Yuffie. Here is a hint, don't look for her if you get this game.\nOverall: 5 stars: Only problems are: random battles can get anoying, you can't skip cutscenes(I guess that's not too bad but the movie at the begining I wish you could skip atleast),takes too long after birth or breeding for a chocobo to be able to breed again.\nYou play(well you actually play several characters)Cloud Strife, an ex-member of Soldier(kind of an army police sort of thing working for Shinra) who has joined with a team Avalanche who are against Shinra...a corporation that is draining mako energy out of the planet with reactors (without mako energy the planet will die). But what starts out as a mission against Shinra becomes a struggle to save the world. It's more than that, though, so I will leave you to find out for yourself. There are alot of side quests too. Like chocobo breeding(Oh yeah,You gotta try that) or the gold saucer which is like a big arcade.\nDisregard all negative reviews about this game(they don't know what there talking about).

This takes away from the strategy of battles.  The only things that make your characters different is their limit breaks and what materia you have equipped to that character, and what weapon each uses.

This is the game that made me want a PlayStation in the first place.  The story....jeez, it's better than most books.  It has so much, so many twists, and lots of unexpected surprises, that once you finish this great game, you'll feel proud of yourself, and you'll go to everyone and say \"I JUST BEAT FINAL FANTASY 7! YES!\"  It's that good. The FMV is excellent, I wouldn't expect anything else for Sqaresoft, and the music fits the mood.  The in-game graphics could use some work.  They have blocks for hands and have no mouths, but it's the graphics are not THAT important.  With battle, don't expect this to be a shooter or anything, the battle system is called Turned based.  That means that each character has a meeter, and when it fills up, they can attack, cast magic, summon a monster, or whatever.  One annoying thing about battles, is that when you walk around, there are too many random battles.  One fun thing to do is equiping weapons, armor, and materia.  Materia is the magic get to use.  It's also the summons.  The game world is HUGE.  It is.  And there is so much to do, that the list is nameless, and it's just like a real world.  There is also a place where you can breed chocobos, they are giant birds.  Doing this takes a long time, but it's very rewarding.  THat's just one of the things you can do.

It's the reason I became the gamer I am today!\nFinal Fantasy VII puts you in the shoes of a young man by the name of Cloud Strife. Starting off, you're simply a mercenary hired by a resistance force called Avalanche, whom are fighting against the earth-dominating orginization, Shinra. Progressing through the story, however, you find it goes much deeper than that. Throughout his adventure, Cloud strives to find the link between him and his arch enemy (but once friend) Sephiroth, what Shinra is planning for the world, and struggles to find where his emotions lie in a deep love triangle between his long-time friend Tifa, and the kind-hearted flower girl, Aeris. Of course, along the game there are many other characters and sub-missions that lead to different stories, but either way this game promises to leave a lasting impression.\nThe gameplay, much like the story, is simply amazing! As you progress through the game, you will find new Accesories (items such as rings, ear rings, ribbons, etc.), Armor, and Weapons. Depending on each items power, your overall strength for attacks, defense against attacks, magic effectiveness, and magic defense will increase; however, the true depth comes in the junction system. Each item you equip to yourself will give you junction blocks. These blocks are used to equip magic that you buy or find along your journey. Magic comes in many forms:Some increase stats, some heal, some are attacks, some are devastating monsters (called 'Summons') that unleash devastating attacks on all enemies, and some help you attain more items (such as the ability to 'Steal'). Junctioning magic can also lower stats, bringing more strategy into the game. Junction too much magic, and your character's overall hp (or 'health points', which decrease with each hit) will be minimized in the next battle. Junction to little, and your character will be to weak to inflict any useful damage on the enemy.\nMy final great aspect in this epic edition of this great series, is the music. The music in the game effects your overall emotions as you play, making the game look and feel even more amazing. I guarantee that after playing this game, you'll find yourself humming at least two of its tracks!\nSo in conclusion, this game is FLAWLESS! If you want something that will satisfy your gaming pleasure for many a day, this is it. Final Fantasy VII is quite possibly the best game ever made, and in my opinion is still unrivaled.","summary":"In the land of Gaming...Final Fantasy is king.","unixReviewTime":987724800,"vote":"48","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Final Fantasy VII is no different, with the perfect amount of Playstation flair to compliment, not overtake the strong story and game system that are the series' hallmarks.\nWhile old-school gamers may prefer pre-defined roles for each character, the Materia system is still meritorious on its own, allowing uncomplicated customization of characters and adding great depth to gameplay.  Character development proceeds well, with nearly every battle in the game having purpose (unlike some RPGs where hours are spent \"leveling up\" to get characters past an obstacle), and the in-game pointers help clarify locations whenever the lush graphics are unclear.  The soundtrack is otherworldly, with several haunting, beautiful songs that are simply unforgettable.\nBut Final Fantasy's core has always been its great storylines, and this installment has one of the best.  Characters develop and mature realistically, and you get to know each one intimately, almost feeling kinship with some of them.  The plot is suitably but not comically epic, and the main struggle plays out better than most Hollywood movies.  Nearly everyone will laugh and cry at various parts of the game, a feat precious few video games have ever accomplished.  From a storyteller's perspective the shocking twist at the game's midpoint is perhaps too easy a way to draw emotion from the player, but there is no denying its effectiveness, as it is one of the most memorable scenes in video game history.\nSquare has released many RPGs on Playstation, some of them terrific on their own, but none have topped their first, a must-purchase for all Playstation owners.  If you like incredible stories but don't own a Playstation, it's worth buying one just for Final Fantasy VII.","summary":"Playstation Final Fantasy Debut Shines on All Levels","unixReviewTime":986774400,"vote":"7","style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

From the moment you pop the first CD in, you are nothing but impressed. I wish all games started out the way this one does--with a BANG! You are Cloud, a selfish newcomer to a resistance group known as AVALANCHE. You don't care about the planet. No way. As soon as this job is done, you want to get your cut and split. The dialogue is truly something else. And the storyline, WOW! The whole idea of a city on a \"plate\" was really original and appealing. Great movie-sequences. I could go on and on praising this game. Even after playing Final Fantasy 9 I can't help but go back and play this great game. Yeah, it is more science fiction than fantasy, but it is science fiction done RIGHT. Although the game is only three CD's long, the game lasts anywhere from 40 to 80 hours. In the first CD, you spend 6 hours in the huge city of Midgar alone. Then you go on for another 10 hours or so, before going to disc 2. This game has great music, especially the ending boss music. That song is called \"One-Winged Angel\". By the way, Sephiroth is pronounced, \"Sea-fee-roth\". At least that's how they pronounce it in the song. Speaking of Sephiroth, he's really cool. Definitely the best villian I've ever seen. Overall, this is either the first or second best RPG I've ever played. First place might go to Final Fantasy 6. Sure, the graphics are way outdated on that game, but the storyline more than made up for it.

It's well-paced, the plot twists arising out of the characters and situations as presented, and nothing really shows up as a deus ex machina (except for the bit with the blasted snake ...)\nThe characters are generally well-developed;  while the three main characters get most of the development, each of the other characters, including the optional ones, get a few scenes with insight into their actions or their pasts.  These characters also have reasons to be working together, rather than just thrown together haphazardly. The female characters are excellent, though Aeris is just a bit TOO perky.\nThe villain is excellent, well-handled and well-developed.  The lesser villains and some of the other NPCs also get a bit of character development (the optional quest in Wutai with the Turks has to be one of my favorite bits in the game), And the villains' actions make sense within the context.\nThe materia system is complicated.  Expect to spend some time fussing with it to understand how it works.  This is not necessarily a negative, mind.\nThe music is great.  From what I understand, it's a distinct departure from the earlier games, but I haven't played them.  There are a few mediocre pieces, such as Honeybee Manor, but the truly excellent pieces, such as the Turks' Theme, Nightmare's Beginning (Vincent's Theme), and One-Winged Angel (final battle music), more than make up for them, and there are no truly annoying God-don't-play-this-song-again pieces in it.\nThe only real problem I have with this game, is that the FMVs can't be skipped (there's only so many times you can watch the thing with the gondola ...) and that the last battle, especially if you've done the optional quests, is too easy.","summary":"Wonderful","unixReviewTime":973728000,"vote":null,"style":{"Format:":" Video Game"},"image":null}

Boy, was I WRONG!\nThe gameplay matches that of Final Fantasy VI (FFIII in the US), but the controller for the playstation adds a new stability element to control.  The battle system is very simple any [person] can win random battles with the clean interface.  Also, the Materia System (magic system) is very user freindly and gives the character's powers that you can almost feel you now posess yourself.\nTo add to this interactive realism is the greatest graphics before Resident Evil 2.  The pre-rendered backgrounds are more artistic than most entire games are, the battles are cool with cool monsters and amazing spell effects, and the Cinematics, ..., well, just WOW!\nTo continue this interacive movie\/addition to life itself is yet another great soundtrack composed by gamemusic god Nobuo Uematsu (bigger than any other composer name).  The music arranges from mysical to energetic, from simple to epic, and from peaceful to apacalyptic.  \"Aeris\", \"Cid\", \"The World\", \"Jenova\" and \"The One Winged Angel\" (the last battle theme) are the best tracks in the game, and some of the finest tracks ever devised.\nTo complete this circle, Squaresoft gave this game a storyline of true epic preportions.  While I did tear several times in earlier Final Fantasy titles, I never really CRIED, but when the big plot twist at the end of CD 1 occurs, I still ball my eyes out.  Never before has emotion and narrative been combined so well into one epic.  When done with the game (and watching the stunning ending that's beyond description), I felt like I just finished a novel, one in which was beyond the puny use of words could elaborate.

The instruction book isn't as clear as it  could be on how it works. Your best bet to understanding it is either  listen to what the people in the game tell you about materia or, even  better, mess around with it. I learned most of the tricks to materia by  going into battle, using my materia, and then changing it and finding  another battle. This not only helps you learn how the materia works but  gives you experience as well.\nAnother thing about this game is that you  MUST pay attention to the story. I don't know how many times my brother  distracted me and I missed an important part of the story. And because the  plot is so complicated, going for a long time without playing is not  recommended because you tend to forget small things that end up becoming  big things later in the story.\nWell, if you were going to by one game for  Playstation, make it this one.

I say that because the type of person who'd enjoy this game most likely already owns it. If, however, you're looking to see what the Dreamcast version has to offer, or you're trying to break into the genre, read on.\nFirst and foremost, fans of strictly 3D fighters (a la Tekken, Soul Calibur, or Dead or Alive) need not apply. This game is 2D only, and if you've grown accustomed to the slower pacing of most 3D fighters, the transition can be a bit of a shock. You should know what it is, exactly, that you're buying before you order. Also, this game isn't the best looking 2D fighter you can buy. While it certaintly looks nice, it doesn't look really any better than the arcade version as far as character animation and such goes.\nSo why the 5 star rating? Simple. The gameplay. This game has it in droves, and this isn't the instant pick-it-up-and-master-it-in-10-minutes kind of gameplay. The multiple single player missions, character saves, three different \"isms\", and the overall deep build of the game make it seem more like an extremely high speed game of chess than a $20 fighter. A good player can soundly trounce those with less experience, and it's very rare that a new player can sometimes one-up a veteran through luck and button mashing. Tekken has this problem, though some don't consider it a problem. I, however, prefer a system that rewards those with the patience to master it. To each his own.\nThis game can, and will, teach you if you're willing to learn, however. A very good single player element lets you build up your characters in a quasi-RPGish manner. The better you fight, the more points you have to spend on making your character more powerful. You newly beefed character can either be left to complete the single player missions on his own (which are very creative and fun with set objectives like \"beat 5 characters at once\" or \"use only super moves\") or can be exported to the arcade or vs. modes. For added fun, find a friend with a character he's made, and pit your two characters against each other. Or, just play it in regular old arcade mode, which is perfectly translated and looks just perfect on the Dreamcast. If you thought the PSX version looked nice, wait till you see this. It won't turn any heads who are used to 3D, but as far as  2D goes, it looks mighty good considering the age of the game.\nAll in all, an excellent choice if you consider yourself old-school fighting gamer and have the patience to learn. For those who prefer quick, painless, flashy, and shallow, look elsewhere.\nFor those in the know, this is Capcom in top form.","summary":"A modern fighting classic","unixReviewTime":996364800,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

How many games can you say that about without being unrealistically optimistic? Soul Calibur for Dreamcast has highly fluid game play, taking the very best elements of other fighting games of the time and turning them into something beautiful. If you have a Dreamcast, this title is essential. With unlockable characters and story mode, replay value is extremely high. If you have a \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality, the story mode will keep you busy for a very long time.

{"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"04 25, 2012","reviewerID":"A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","asin":"B00000K125","reviewerName":"Tsanche","reviewText":"In 1996 Namco released a game called Soul Blaade in North America (known as Soul Edge in Japan) and it was a game that focused on weapons based combat and centered on several characters going after a sword called Soul Edge.  Either to destroy it or attain it for their own means.  When Namco began talking about a sequel one of the first things they knew they wanted to incorporate was the use of the entire arena instead of just characters moving on one line.  This eventually lead the creation of 8 way run.  Where one could--literally--walk circles around their opponent.  But was it right to simply call it Soul Blade 2?  Project Soul thought not.  Instead they called their new creative and innovative fighter: Soul Calibur.\n\nThough not having a fantastic run in Arcades, the game was ported to the Dreamcast in 1999 and launched with the system.  When it was released it was such a smashing success and offered so much for players that we had a new champion of fighters.  It was simple enough for newcomers but had enough depth for experts.  But more than that, 8 way run and the detail the game had was, at the time, just unheard of.  Looking at it now, it's hard to believe the game was originally made in 1998.  It was not only well ahead of its time, but the only game that really seemed to give it any competition was the release of Soul Calibur II years later.  Since it's release the original Soul Calibur has gone on to be recognized as one of the greatest and most innovative games ever made.  And to this day, the only game that is really like Soul Calibur are the other Soul Calibur games.\n\nMany fighting games are not much for their stories.  A lot of them can tell a story but they're primarily about the fighting.  The original Soul Calibur is the same way, but there is actually an emphasis on characters and the relationships that these characters feel they have with other characters.  Every character has their own unique ending to Arcade Mode and every character has a biography that you can read to learn about them.  There's definitely a story and a narrative at work here.  As you read about the characters you'll learn as to why each of them are going after Soul Edge.  Their stories are tragic but interesting.  It's even more fun for those who played the original Soul Blade.  Things hadn't become quite convoluted with the story yet.  And when you read about all these characters some of them you're bound to find intriguing in their own way.  You may even find yourself having a favorite.  Not just because of how they fight... but because of who they are as a person.  They've got personality here and it shows not only in their exchanges in combat, their endings in Arcade and their biographies, but also in just how well they fight.\n\nSoul Calibur has a simple way of fighting.  You've got horizontal, vertical and kick attacks.  You can also guard and, of course, move all around the ring.  You can also combine attacks by pressing two buttons simultaneously for different attacks.  The implimentation of 8 way run really increases the number of moves which can be done.  It's simple to pick up Soul Calibur but the game itself is fairly difficult to master.  Unlike other games, there is actually qutie an emphasis on pokes, precise strikes and quick moves rather than emphasising the need to learn tons of special moves and combos.  It certainly doesn't hurt to learn these things, but no one will feel powerless when playing Soul Calibur.  But it does have a few complex moves and combos none the less.  Some characters have slide input movements while others may have attacks that require much more precise timing.  Anyone can pick up the game and utilize pokes, but a true master will actually have to sit down and train with some of their favorite characters.\n\nIt's also to no surprise that Soul Calibur does put a huge emphasis on the player's ability to move all over the arena instead of just in a straight line where they my have moves that step to the side.  This is emphasized by the fact that any character can also attack while circling another.  Or they can use this to side step opponents.  This wasn't just some gimmick thrown in, this was pretty much what Soul Calibur was all about.  To put more emphasis on this, Soul Calibur allows players to knock one another out of the ring.  If there was anything that stood out in Soul Calibur as a real flaw it MIGHT be this little tidbit.  Unlike future games in the series, the first game made knocking someone out of the ring a fairly simple thing to do.  Characters went out of the ring far more easily than otherwise.  And while it's great to snatch a victory through ring out, it can be a pain when you suffered a ring out just because a very small portion went over the ring.\n\nAside from that, Soul Calibur was a nearly flawless game.  It managed to do this by offering players what the Arcade couldn't.  Before Soul Calibur came out in 1999 if you wanted the best graphics and best experience with fighting games you typically went to Arcade to have it.  Soul Calibur was one of the games that helped to change this, in part because of the Dreamcast.  The Dreamcast version of the game looked and sounded better than the Arcade version.  The stages were more detailed.  The backgrounds, rather than being pre-rendered, were actually in 3D.  The game was the prettiest thing on the market in 1999.  And the characters were also detailed.  The console version of the game also offered different modes.  You had the typical Arcade mode, but the game also gave you a survival mode and things to keep you busy such as the game's Mission Mode.  Where you went to various stages to partake in missions.  These missions earned you points, which you could exchange in the Art Gallery.  Sometimes when you bought art in the gallery you unlocked other missions, stages or character exhibition theaters.  There was a lot to unlock in Soul Calibur.  It was an experience you simply couldn't have in the Arcade.\n\nAs a result, Soul Calibur has also managed to age well, in part because it was so far ahead of its time.  In fact, its sequels can only seem to do worse because aside from tweaking characters and adding moves, there isn't really much you can do to improve the experience of Soul Calibur.  A franchise that achieves this much critical and commercial success right out of the gate doesn't really have anywhere to go but down.  And indeed, the Soul Calibur series has often been criticized that not much has been done to the basic formula as the years have gone by.  But when you play the first game it becomes apparent that it's really hard to build on that particular foundation.  We're talking about a game that was hailed by critics and consumers as one of the greatest games of all time when it first dropped onto the Dreamcast in 1999 (and is one of the few games on Amazon that still retains a five star rating years later).  Where exactly do you go from \"Greatest,\" exactly?  No where, really.  But it seems to be a testament as to how powerful and impactful Soul Calibur really ended up being.  The original still manages to be a strong game even by todays standards.\n\nThe Soul continues to burn bright and those who still have their Dreamcast should own this game.  It is not just one of the best games you can find on the system, but still remains as one of the greatest games ever made.","summary":"\"Welcome Back to the Stage of History...\"","unixReviewTime":1335312000,"vote":"2","style":null,"image":null}
{"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"05 2, 2011","reviewerID":"A1YVM25R9R9ENG","asin":"B00000K125","reviewerName":"Joel McGee","reviewText":"The Dreamcast certainly had an abundance of fighting games. You could easily fill your shelves with Capcom's fighters alone. But one title stands as not only the best game on the system, but the one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nSoul Calibur was a launch title for the DC but you wouldn't be able to tell by the level of refinement, both in asthetics and gameplay.\n\nFirst, the graphics are phenomenal for their day. Nothing looked this good back in 1999 on the consoles. The character models were heads and tails above anything gamers had ever saw; they were clean, smooth, detailed, featured flawless animation, with fantastic effects like clothes and hair waving in the wind. The backgrounds are amazing too, various settings from underground caves, deteriorating castles, and Japanese style training grounds.\n\nIt also rus in progessive scan with a framerate that never falters no matter how intense battles get. Not only that it looks better than the arcade version, quite possibly the first game to accomplish this feat.\n\nSound is excellent too, even today, the voice work sounds great (although it is in Japanese, so I can't understand it). Sound effects are equally impressive, the clash of swords and other weapons sound great, nothing is overdone, or repetivive. The music is wonderful, it's great to hear it has aged so well, even after all these years. Namco could have easily thown togther some bland 80's rock styled music, but it wouldn't have done the game justice. The sweeping classical tunes work rather well with the fast paced, yet tactical gameplay.\n\nAs far as the gameplay itself, it's perfectly paced, not too fast, not too slow. It is a game that is easy to learn hard to master. In my opinion, Soul Calibur is the most balanced of any 3D fighter. Even a beginner can pick up a controller, understand the basic concepts of the game and have some success just feeling out the game. However, it's not like Tekken (Namco's other 3D fighter) that allows button mashers to cheat their way to victory, if a person bothers to learn a characters moves, he can easily devistate a beginner. There are tons of advanced moves beyond just learing a command list, there are techniques such as the advanced guard and the 8-way run to master that seperate the average player to the advanced one. Combine this with strategies that a factored into most 3D fighters like forcing the ring out and using the clock to your advanage and you have a fighter with a serious amount of depth.\n\nWhile soul caibur has tons of depth, it would have not have reached a perfect score had it not taken it to the next level, and by that I mean modes. That is the mistake that Virtua Fighter 3tb made. Namco saw fit to make Soul Calibur on the dreamcast the most ambitious 3D fighter to date, and they succeeded. They did a wonderful job of adding a fully featured versus mode, team battle, survival, and extra survival (one hit kill), modes, but they all pale in comparison to mission mode.\n\nMission mode is by far the greatest feature of Soul Calibur. Unlike Soul Blade where you had a handful of character specific missions that weren't very fun, Mission mode allows you to pick any character that you desire and progress at your own pace. Missions range from winning with a ring out, to survival matches, and later throw in more obsure challenges. While they are challenging, they are for the most part, fair. As you beat each of these mode you will acquire points to buy artwork; purchasing this artwork will unlock more missions, costumes, characters and stages. By the time you finish this mode not only will you be an accoplished swordsman, but you will have a robust amount of content to show for your efforts.\n\nThere is a reason Soul Calibur has the reputation that it doesn 12 years later. The game is simply stellar. It has aged rather gracefully and is the best game on the DC. The game is also available through Xbox live for $10 but omits the mission mode and has everything already unlocked. This is truly the version to get if you want to fully experience the games as it was intended by Namco. I highly reccomend this game as one of the greatest games ever made.","summary":"A Masterpiece 10 out of 10","unixReviewTime":1304294400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}
