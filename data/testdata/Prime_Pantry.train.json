Keefer","reviewText":"Want to put a little high fructose corn syrup on your meat?  Then buy this bbq sauce.  This is a sweet BBQ sauce. However, nutritionists and doctors recommend staying away from high fructose corn syrup and this sauce lists it as the first ingredient. Why is HFCS bad for you? Here's what a cardiologist says:\n\n\"High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a type of sugar that has been processed and combined with corn syrup to produce a cheap, easily dissolvable sweetener. But this sugar is quickly absorbed by the liver where it is converted into fat. Since your brain doesn't recognize HFCS as regular food, it never shuts off the appetite center -- so you keep eating. Blood sugar levels rise, massive amounts of insulin is recruited to metabolize it and then you crash and feel hungry again. It is found in soft drinks, fruit juices, salad dressings and baked goods. Read the food labels of products in your pantry and refrigerator and throw out all products that contain HFCS.\"\n\n A family member bought this brand without reading the label, so we'll be throwing it out. Too much corn syrup does nasty things to your body - there are BBQ Sauces which are healthier. This one lists it as a primary ingredient:\n\nHigh Fructose Corn Syrup, Distilled Vinegar, Tomato Paste, Modified Food Starch, contains less than 2% of: Salt, Pineapple Juice Concentrate, Natural Smoke Flavor, Spices, Caramel Color, Sodium Benzoate as a preservative, Molasses, Corn Syrup, Garlic,* Sugar, Tamarind, Natural Flavor.\n\nIf you only like sweet BBQ sauces, then they may be high in sugar and high fructose corn syrup. There are tangier sauces which contain no high fructose corn syrup and are lower in sugar.\n\nI personally like Stubbs BBQ which you can get on Amazon which doesn't have high fructose corn syrup.","summary":"Want to Put Some High Fructose Corn Syrup on Your Meat?","unixReviewTime":1424390400,"vote":2.0,"image":null,"style":null}

For some reason, he likes it.  But since this is MY review, and not his, I will tell you why I HATE THIS SOAP.\n\nIt's the most drying soap I have ever seen.  He has SEVERE dry skin on his hands and about a quarter of the way up his forearm - the area he washes when washing his hands.  And it's not just dry skin - it literally looks like he is growing a fine layer of soap in the crevices of his skin.  You feel his skin, and it has an odd...well...soapy feel.  This is just on the hands, but because he washes his hands often during the day (well, when need be...) this is what it causes.  He also uses this soap to bathe with, but since that's just once a day you don't notice a terrible effect.  However, I have run out of body wash a few times and been forced to use his soap before I could get to the store, and it LITERALLY leaves you feeling like you have a layer of soap scum on your skin.  Like you haven't rinsed, even when you have.  Like you need to scrape your skin down with a razor.  Really, it's bad.\n\nNow, onto something that bothers me even more - the literally scum this soap lives in the sink and shower.  It's the worst soap I have ever had to clean up after.  After two days of not cleaning the sink, there is a visible and DURABLE layer of soap scum throughout.  Same with the tub.  He also uses it in the kitchen, and it doesn't seem to have the same effect on the stainless steel, at least.  But this soap is extremely difficult to clean up - I often have to scrub my bathroom with SOS pads just to remove the soap scum - and it's not because I go for weeks without cleaning, it's because this soap is terrible.\n\nSmells great.","summary":"Dirtiest soap ever.","unixReviewTime":1437523200,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

Hart","reviewText":"Barbara's Bakery Cereal, Peanut Butter Puffins, 11 Oz. (312g), by Barbara's Bakery.\nThis cereal is designed for kids. The cereal's title may not sound appetizing, but it tastes reasonably good, although not great, and it may leave your stomach feeling a bit queasy. Maybe my box was a bit rancid, as after eating a bowl, it started me burping, even though the Best By date was still in the future at: 07 June 2015.\nThis is a puffed cereal, and the internal plastic bag is difficult to open. I am definitely not a weakling, but I had to use a pair of scissors to cut open the bag. After opening the bag, I noticed the smell of peanut butter, and after trying a piece of it, I decided that it tasted like corn and peanut butter. This cereal stands up to milk quite well without becoming soggy.\nI gave this cereal one star due to a strange aftertaste, too much peanut butter, the hard to open bag, my unsettled and burping stomach, and the high amount of salt used in making it. (Too much salt can cause high blood pressure and water retention. Processed foods in general contain far too much sugar and salt.) One bowl was enough. I dumped the remainder of the box into the galvanized metal bird seed barrel that I keep on the side porch for over-filling the bird feeder (the doves need to feed on the ground).\nAt this point, it was too late to return it to the supermarket for a refund.\nThe Nutrition Facts and Ingredients, as listed on the box:\n\nNutrition Facts:\nServing size  Cup (30g), Servings Per Container About 10.\nAmount Per Serving:\nCalories 110 (Calories from Fat 20).\nTotal Fat 2g (Saturated Fat 0.5g, Trans Fat 0g, Polyunsaturated Fat 0g, Monounsaturated Fat 0g).\nCholesterol 0mg.\nSodium 230mg.\nPotassium 105mg\nTotal Carbohydrate 23g (Dietary Fiber 2g, Sugars 6g).\nProtein 3g.\n\nIngredients:\nNon-GMO Corn, Cane Sugar, Peanut Butter (Ground Peanuts, Salt), Whole Oats, Rice, Sea Salt, Tocopherols (antioxidants to maintain freshness), baking soda.\n\nContains peanut butter.

Hardly any veg, except for tons of nice cheap carrots, how do I know carrots are cheap, because that's what this is a can of carrots. There is not even much rice in it. Worst of all the flavor is gone, no more amazing herby greatness, just kind of a watered down version of it's former self.\n\nIt went from being an amazing product to being substandard, It's not even on the same level as Campbell's or Progresso anymore.

I've added a few drops to any number of dishes that I wanted to \"kick up\" a notch and used it regularly in a Bloody\/Virgin Mary.\n\nI'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently.\n\nAfter purchasing and taste testing over 40 different hot sauces (everyone needs a hobby), writing up notes, test tasting them blind again - writing up new notes and then comparing my old versus new notes  ----- I have to say Tabasco's original blend turns out to be one of the worse hot sauces I have tested.\n\nTabasco's original has only two tastes: hot peppers combined with a very heavy dose of vinegar. The bitter vinegar after-taste, so typical in Tabasco's original, is not an inherent quality of a good hot sauce.\n\nI could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco's original but here are just a few that are widely available: I encourage you to try any or all of them. I'm very certain you will be pleasantly surprised.\n\n1) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (as potent as Tabasco) but with far less vinegar with a hint of sugar and garlic. Available in most supermarkets. Praised in many reviews and rightly so. Look for a large bottle with a rooster on the label.\n\n2) Cholula Hot Sauce (milder and less vinegar) - often highly rated by professional reviewers and available in most supermarkets. Look for the wooden top.\n\n3) Tabasco's own Chipotle blend (much milder - rich tasting) featuring the chipotle smoked pepper -less vinegar - widely available\n\nI hope I've encouraged you to try a few other hot sauces.\n\nPS: Once you get away from Tabasco's (original) hot sauce and what I find to be its excessive vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are so many superior hot sauces available that it is almost hard to comprehend. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market. While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original blend ---- that is not a \"plus\" in my view but rather a \"minus\" - a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw (a lot of vinegar) is an attribute. BTW: Less anyone think I have an axe to grind with Tabasco - see my review of Tabasco's Chipotle hot sauce which I rated as excellent!\n\nWhat more can I say - experiment - I sincerely doubt you will stick with Tabasco's original hot sauce.\n\nUPDATE (August 2013): While my review was written over a year before - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS, TESTED HOT SAUCES.\n\n What sauce came in very LAST?\n Tabasco!\n\n What was first?\n Huy Fong Sriracha.\n\nI'll admit it is nice to have a professional tasting panel come to the very same conclusions I arrived at a year earlier.\n\nTastes vary of course","summary":"Well know but Far from the best.

The cereal's title may not sound appetizing, but it tastes reasonably good, although not great, and it may leave your stomach feeling a bit queasy. Maybe my box was a bit rancid, as after eating a bowl, it started me burping, even though the Best By date was still in the future at: 07 June 2015.\nThis is a puffed cereal, and the internal plastic bag is difficult to open. I am definitely not a weakling, but I had to use a pair of scissors to cut open the bag. After opening the bag, I noticed the smell of peanut butter, and after trying a piece of it, I decided that it tasted like corn and peanut butter. This cereal stands up to milk quite well without becoming soggy.\nI gave this cereal one star due to a strange aftertaste, too much peanut butter, the hard to open bag, my unsettled and burping stomach, and the high amount of salt used in making it. (Too much salt can cause high blood pressure and water retention. Processed foods in general contain far too much sugar and salt.) One bowl was enough.

The bitter vinegar after-taste, so typical in Tabasco's original, is not an inherent quality of a good hot sauce.\n\nI could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco's original but here are just a few that are widely available: I encourage you to try any or all of them. I'm very certain you will be pleasantly surprised.\n\n1) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (as potent as Tabasco) but with far less vinegar with a hint of sugar and garlic. Available in most supermarkets. Praised in many reviews and rightly so. Look for a large bottle with a rooster on the label.\n\n2) Cholula Hot Sauce (milder and less vinegar) - often highly rated by professional reviewers and available in most supermarkets. Look for the wooden top.\n\n3) Tabasco's own Chipotle blend (much milder - rich tasting) featuring the chipotle smoked pepper -less vinegar - widely available\n\nI hope I've encouraged you to try a few other hot sauces.\n\nPS: Once you get away from Tabasco's (original) hot sauce and what I find to be its excessive vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are so many superior hot sauces available that it is almost hard to comprehend. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market. While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original blend ---- that is not a \"plus\" in my view but rather a \"minus\" - a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw (a lot of vinegar) is an attribute. BTW: Less anyone think I have an axe to grind with Tabasco - see my review of Tabasco's Chipotle hot sauce which I rated as excellent!\n\nWhat more can I say - experiment - I sincerely doubt you will stick with Tabasco's original hot sauce.\n\nUPDATE (August 2013): While my review was written over a year before - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS, TESTED HOT SAUCES.\n\n What sauce came in very LAST?\n Tabasco!\n\n What was first?\n Huy Fong Sriracha.\n\nI'll admit it is nice to have a professional tasting panel come to the very same conclusions I arrived at a year earlier.\n\nTastes vary of course","summary":"Well know but Far from the best.

Our dentist and his dental hygienist strongly recommend this brand and I got a good explanation why during my last cleaning, so we checked Amazon for the unflavored variety.  According to our dentist's office, this actually traps more food than waxed floss because of being made from Gore-tex.  Initially, I was quite happy at a large quantity at a good price, and an easy source.\n\nBut something in the back of my mind triggered an internet search on Glide and Gore-tex.  Immediately I found the long list of articles claiming I was going to die from all kinds of different cancers, get brain damage, etc., because of the chemicals used to make Gore-tex and Glide floss.\n\nFrankly, I'm more than a little sick of all the horror stories on the internet about almost any subject one can find.  Everything is going to make us die horrible deaths, if the internet is to be believed.  Yet it's important to know that in our family we now use as few chemicals as reasonably possible.  We don't use chemicals in our garden, and have the best crops of veggies ever this year.  And yes, we use Black Berkey water filters for our supposedly high quality tap water, drinking or cooking nothing out of the tap unless it's first gone through our Berkey filter. (Note: don't buy Berkey filters on Amazon - Berkey doesn't warrant them because of the practices of some of the after-market companies.)  We use various other products that area as natural as we can get, and eat a lot of organic foods, drink raw milk, etc.  Sound like some healthfood whackos? Maybe - yet remember, I was initially skeptical about the massive number of warning articles about the perfluoro- compounds in Glide floss.  Why?  I want reasonable proof of things.\n\nAnd I kept looking, and looking, and can find almost nothing substantiating the safety of these compounds, or even that they supposedly no longer persist in the finished product - just that they're used in creating it (that was the argument with them in creating Teflon).  And I spent considerable time searching the P&G web site, searched all of their FAQs for this product, and even attempted to find a product safety data sheet on this product - they don't list one despite having such sheets for other products - they don't even have an \"ingredients\" sheet for Glide floss.\n\nSo my bottom line is that I'm out the money spent on this product because it's past the Amazon return period.  Fine - not Amazon's fault, they're just a retailer, or the vehicle retailers use.  But out of what now seems more like reasonable caution, rather than a \"just in case\" caution, I am discontinuing the use of this product, and going back to my previous unflavored, waxed regular dental floss.  Do your own research - your mileage may vary....","summary":"I was thrilled to find this product here, and it came highly recommended by our dentist and hygienist - then we did research!","unixReviewTime":1498694400,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

To create foam, manufacturers add sodium laurel sulfate, which may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, a probable carcinogen.

We looked and looked and finally found bits of plastic stuck in the drain at the bottom of the machine and even in the holes in the washer arms. I couldn't figure out where it could have come from. Well today I washed my dishes again with one of these tablets. It didn't dissolve completely. The plastic that was left stuck in the cup looked exactly like what I had found clogging the machine. I'm done with these for sure now even though I hate throwing out this expensive product. It would be much more expensive if it totally clogged the motor.\n\nUPDATE The reason the dishes didn't get clean was because the dishwasher packet didn't dissolve. I dried the dishwasher holder thoroughly. I hope that the whole box off cleaners isn't ruined. I put them in a dry place. I wrote the company and they gave me the \"you're water's probably not hot enough\". Not true. I also used the water heater boost on my dishwasher. I can see the other tablets are appearing to break down. I have them stored in  dry place and I make sure the holder in the dishwasher is perfectly dry and my hands are dry when I touch the tablets. These might work ok someplace where there is no humidity.\n\nI have only used this once, but it works better than the other type of one piece dishwasher detergent. I've used two of the other name brands and I left my dishes dirtier than normal when I used this one and it cleaned better than the others.\n\nUPDATE The  second time I used these I didn't scrape all the food residue from my dishes. The directions said it wasn't necessary. I will probably need to soak and clean the dishes then re-wash them. This didn't work as well as prior products I've used. The first load I washed I had already made sure there was no remaining food. The food this left on seems like it shouldn't have been that hard to get off.

I take oral medications, and while my numbers aren't perfect, I do run an A1C of 6.1 (give or take .1 - .3).\n\nI've heard the so-called benefits of Coconut Sugar, and have been focusing on low-glycemic meals for some time, so giving Coconut Palm Sugar a whirl seemed like a no-brainer to me.\n\nI ordered a package set up a very informal test to gauge its efficacy, and now am sitting down to write my review.\n\nSo?\n\nFirst: My Test Construct\n\nTo test this product, and compare it to other products, I used the following:\n1. For food, I had 1 cup of plain cooked steel-cut oatmeal\n2. For beverages I used 16 oz of home-brewed unsweetned ice tea\n\nI ran each test on different days (e.g. Day 1 - Coconut Sugar in Oatmeal; Day 2 Coconut Sugar in Ice Tea; Day 3 Equal in Oatmeal, and so forth) and tried the tests at the same time of day.\n\nObservations:\n\nA. Flavor - I found a slight flavor profile shift and an unappetizing colorization (to the yellowish-brown spectrum). This was the first negative for me.\n\nB. Sweetness - in the oatmeal test, I used 1 tsp of the product (the recommended serving size) in my oatmeal\n  - I could discern no appreciable sweetening of the oatmeal\n  - Glycemic Load - I found no real significant difference between this product, Equal, or plain oatmeal (unsweetened) on my pre- and post- blood sugar levels\n  Test:  I tested my blood sugar prior to consuming, then 30 minutes after consuming, then 1 hour after consuming.\n\n (NOTE: Comparison to brown sugar:  I detected a hint of sweetness, but saw 30 point spike in my blood sugar at 30-minutes).\n\nIn Beverages:\n  The Test:  Again to test this, I used 1 16oz glass of Ice Tea with no additional ingredients (just loose leaf black tea I brew)\n  The Product:  I added 2 tsp of the Coconut Sugar (2x the suggested serving amount) to my ice tea\n  Results:  Much the same as above.  I found a slight color shift to brown, and no appreciable sweetening effect of the tea (it tasted no sweeter than just plain ice tea, minus the flavor profile shift of the Coconut Sugar).\n\n  Comparison:  My comparison was (same as above) to check my blood sugar immediately prior to consuming and then 30 minutes after consuming and again 1 hour after consuming.  I found my blood sugar spiked slightly (15 points) with the Coconut Sugar as opposed to plain ice tea or ice tea (sweetened with 1 packet of equal (1g of weight).\n\n  I did not test with sugar at this time, as I felt my results between the oatmeal test and Ice Tea test already indicated a sufficient trend.\n\nC.  Nutritional Value - The claim is the low glycemic and minerals and nutrients.  According to the package's Nutritional information panel, the highest mineral concentration is Potassium (36 mg) followed by Sodium (5 mg) and rounding off the bottom:  Total Carbohydrate (4g) and Sugars (4g).\n  (NOTE: To Compare, 1 average sized banana contains approximately 422mg of Potassium (13% of the DRA for an adult).\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nFor me, I find no significant value in using this product in neither management of glycemic tolerance nor sweetening of food and beverage.  While an argument can be made for Nutritional benefit, this benefit, in my opinion, is negligible.\n\nBasically, I find this product to be a non-functional \"sweetener\" with an unappetizing food colorization and slight flavor profile shift that provided no discernible sweetness. As to nutritional value, I find this product worst of all) near-negligible nutritional value.\n\nI don't find it a better option than just a balanced, nutritious diet.  I don't find it has significant benefit to diabetes management, and I STRONGLY URGE any diabetic to discuss the concerns of relying on this product to aid in diabetes care management with a licensed professional nutritionist\/endocrinologist.\n\nThe only benefit I did find, is it was less taxing on my insulin\/blood sugar levels than equal amounts of refined sugar.\n\nIn closing, these results are only self-observed.  However, the results did show me that, for me anyway, the keys to proper weight control\/diabetes management is sensibility and moderation.","summary":"Never has the phrase \"caveat emptor\" been more applicable than with this product.","unixReviewTime":1403481600,"vote":34.0,"image":null,"style":null}

Could it be my beloved Cottonelle wipes?  So I Googled Cottonelle wipes and itching and BOOM, there it was.  Pages upon pages of stories and consumer reports of anal itching caused by the wipes.  Stories of people that have used these puppies for YEARS without problems.  Or they went through hell for years and never related the issue to the wipes!  Apparently it's narrowed down to one ingredient in the mix called MCI (methylchloroisothiazolinone) and is used as a preservative.  Well, Google that and this is what you are putting ON a mucus membrane!!  You may as well just pop it in your mouth.  No bueno.  Stay away.  I think other brands also use this same preservative.","summary":"Anal itching anyone?","unixReviewTime":1441065600,"vote":4.0,"image":null,"style":null}

This package actually contains 9 sets of plain Pringles, 6 Sour Cream and 3 Cheese.  The way they are stacked, and by use of the window cut (so you can see in the package), would have you believe there are 6 of each, very deceptive, and just plain unethical.  The manufacturer will probably reply, 'The counts of each type of chip are written on the side.'  Yeah, but your use of a window-cut display deters anyone from reading the side, and you know it.  Why would anyone read the side to know what's in the box if you think you're already looking at the contents of the box?  It's classic bait and switch.  This is clearly meant to deceive, people don't buy variety packs to get overwhelmingly plain chips, and you know it.\n\nThis makes me not trust you in general, and people need high trust in food manufacturers since we put their products into our bodies.\n\nSo good job, you got my sale this one time, but you've just cost yourselves dozens (or more) future Pringles purchases from me, and I am going to tell a lot of people about this, probably for decades, each time I see Pringles or if they come up in conversation, or anytime someone talks about unethical and deceptive business practices.  Send this review (and the other negative reviews on this site for this product) on to the 'hotshot' that thought deceiving customers to get a one-time purchase was a good idea, and please also send this to their boss.  You've bought so much ill-will from me and cost yourselves so many future Pringles purchases, and you did it so needlessly, all over saving yourselves a few cents... on just one sale!

Within two hours my eyes were irritated, but I stupidly gave myself a little time and few flushes to see if it was only an initial blast of harsh chemicals. Nope-the entire bathroom and EVERYTHING in it STINK now, a mere half day into its supposed week.\n\nImagine a massively concentrated industrial toilet cleaner-or a mix of Irish Spring soap and Lysol bowl cleaner-and ponder whether you want it absolutely permeating every millimeter of some items... Shower curtain-not the end of the world. The actual sink&bath tub-I suppose showering is fine-washing the tub TWICE to soak seems a waste. How about toilet paper? We know where that goes-starting to get uncomfortable now. Feminine hygiene? Great, just the fragrance I always wanted there-toilet bowl disinfectant... Let's not forget the towels, ALL of them. Want to dry off with something smelling like that? What about washing and drying your face with stinky cloth? Your fancy soap now needs a rinse before using, sustainable, eh? Oh, what's that? My Q-tips&makeup brushes&sponges that while not used often aren't cheap...pity that pressed powder and blush isn't in an airtight container, too.\n\nWhat REALLY drew my attention to how pervasive and bad the smell had become in so little time was my CAT. I have massive 54\" tall body towels that I toss over her cat bed. They're naturally stored in the bathroom closet with all my bath-kitchen-hand towels and my cat howled-a TERRIFYING sound-and refused to lie on the towel despite initial happiness.

My bottles of shampoo&the like, my cotton pads, my medical tape&gauze, and again the absorbent items that touch my most delicate skin, from Kleenex to Kotex so to speak, reek! There's a LOT of laundry to do now, CLEAN laundry that I can't put so near my face with it stinking of hospital bathrooms--it's not so unlike that steri-clean soft-n-sure soap that hateful clinics use, the ones that want everyone to smell like they were made in a toxic chemistry lab to make nursing homes smell that special kind of bad stench!\nI'll stick with the smell that leaves with the second flush.

Im not sure how it got so many good reviews but everyone has different taste what taste good to some people might not taste good to others.\nThis bag wasn't big either in my opinion its very small to be party size compared to other brand of chips. I was only able to take a bite out of one chip and ended up throwing the rest away.\n\nI didn't taste the garlic or parmesan or any flavor it claims to have. THERE IS NO TASTE!  Also the texture of this chip is very and I mean VERY HARD. I had a hard time chewing it that's how hard it is. Its annoying because normally I don't buy brands of chips I never had before but looking for stuff on amazon is a hassle, time consuming and ANNOYING. I\n didn't see all the other choices until after I placed my order and it was too late. I really think amazon needs to do better with setting up the pantry to make it easier to buy and find items. Bottom line is I will NOT buy this brand EVER again, they are so hard to eat im going to throw the rest of the bag in the trash. They have nerves to sell these chips at 5 dollars, Im not sure how much I paid but this is definitely not worth 5 dollars.

This peanut butter was also used by the Khmer Rouge to really make people feel as though there is no way out of the work camps. A food crate was busted open in Kenya during one of the last famine periods only to remain untouched as people would rather starve that ingest this foul substance. This Jif Natural Peanut Butter Spread and Honey, 16 oz should be tried in Nuremberg because its taste is a war crime.\n\nSomething about the sickly sweet taste makes it unsuitable for toasted bread. This Peanut Butter spread also makes bad bedfellows with jelly due to its foul taste blocking out all enjoyment that the jelly might have provided. I must believe that those who bought this product with the Smuckers squeeze bottle jelly are so tweaked out on methamphetamine that the taste buds are failing them. One suggestion I missed with this product was to try it on a vegetable; I couldn't bear the thought of having a farmer work so hard on growing celery only to see it ravaged by this terrible product.\n\nWould not eat this product again unless being force fed in a Seven style force feeding.","summary":"A food crate was busted open in Kenya during one of the last famine periods only to remain untouched as people would rather star","unixReviewTime":1445904000,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

The box is the first clue as blue and a bit smaller.  But I really noticed the change when opening and trying a couple of crackers.  The consistency of this graham cracker is crisper and harder. Its taste is chalky, sweeter and missing most of the graham flavor.  It crumbled like sawdust in my mouth and i realized immediately something cheap had replaced the familiar ingredients and the recipe had changed. I went online searching for word of a recent change in the product as i had missed seeing any announcement.  What I found was a consumer affairs website with hundreds of complaints and comments about various Nabisco crackers including the Honey Made grahams.  Seems Nabisco has shifted making them to a plant and company in Mexico and people are filing complaints about the content, taste and some noted contamination examples in the products.  No one had realized they were buying anything different from the product(s) they had been used to when purchasing for years before and felt people should be made aware the products were not as they were and consumers depended on them to be.  Complaints included Premium saltines...which many of us had purchased for years, now crumbly, flaking off and tasting different... the Honey Maid grahams and Ritz crackers.  A number of consumers complained that the 'Ritz' they received smelled like motor oil and were inedible and smelled up their kitchen so tossed out immediately.  There were comments suggesting that was due to using rancid oil in making the Ritz.  All I know is my grahams were inferior, gave me a bad stomach ache i have had since yesterday and I called Amazon to complain feeling consumers should be given info the products are no longer the same and not from Nabisco in the US but now coming from Mendelez Int'; and made in Mexico.  I tossed the Honey Maid grahams and will never purchase any 'so called' Nabisco brand again ever.  Too bad but life is too short to mess with unknown edibles or odd tastes from what you felt secure with.  Not when buying in the US.

I'll admit, I'm a bit of a mascara snob.  My go to mascara's are Lancme Definicils and Younique 3D but, I recently tried a very cheap Elf mascara because the price was great and I was completely impressed so I thought maybe drugstore mascaras had improved.  After all, I've been using Lancme for over 10 years and makeup has come a long way.  So, I got this, also at a great price, with high hopes.  Turns out it was a complete waste of money...I'm just glad it wasn't much.\n\nThe applicator is really big, almost oversized but has short, sparse, hard little bristles that offer no chance for creating volume.  The wand picks up way more mascara than the brush and is hard to use without making a mess.  The mascara goes on clumpy and actually, unbelievably,  makes my lashes look thinner.  It doesn't harden well.  The color is awful.  It's supposed to be black\/brown which, in my experience is usually pretty dark.  This is brown, not dark at all.  The one positive thing I can say about this is that it is indeed waterproof...took forever to remove.  I totally understand now why Amazon was offering a $3.00 coupon and $5.93 mascara.  Unfortunately, it's not worth the difference.  If you want a decent cheap volumizing mascara, try the e.l.f. Volume Plumping mascara.  It has its faults but at less than $3.00, it's far superior than this and it does make my lashes look thicker and fuller.","summary":"The applicator is awful and the color is just as bad.","unixReviewTime":1463270400,"vote":2.0,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71e36qLN1yL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71ipV27mD4L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71ql6mZKgOL._SY88.jpg"],"style":null}

The flavor is absolutely delicious, and one might find themselves devouring the entire bag at one sitting.\n\nNow for the bad - The parent company is Frito Lay. This is a corporation who is guilty of poisoning its customers daily through using GMO (Genetically Engineered) corn in their products. When I first decided to purchase this popcorn, I bought it because on the bag it specifically states No Artificial Colors, Flavors, or Preservatives.\n\nWhat I didn't notice until later, was a line on the bag that says - Partially Produced with Genetic Engineering\n\nSo basically, my take on this product is that instead of calling this Frito Lay Popcorn, they disguise it by calling it \"Smartfood delight\" - making us think that this is a healthier alternative by claiming that it has No artificial colors, Flavors, or preservatives...but if the popcorn itself is GMO (Genetically engineered) Corn, does anything else really matter?  There is nothing healthy about GMO foods. Furthermore the companies who try to feed them to us through deceptive marketing and advertising should be punished or at the very least called out publicly and shamed for their unethical behavior.\n\nThe reason I decided to give this product a 1 star rating is because I want people to read my review, and I don't feel as if a 2 or 3 star review would get looked at, as much as a 1 star review.\n\nI also want to reiterate that the product does taste delicious,  so if you are the type of person who doesn't care about whether or not you were eating genetically engineered foods, then this product is a popcorn that you would buy based on taste alone. As for the rest of us, I feel like I just got bamboozled because I didn't read the bag close enough when making the original purchase.\n\nI have included two pics from a bag of their White Chedder flavor to help illustrate my points.","summary":"GMO Frito-Lay popcorn disguised as a health-food","unixReviewTime":1471824000,"vote":3.0,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/715aW6RcTlL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71UB0I7K9zL._SY88.jpg"],"style":null}

Instead they were held in a two-space, divided plastic container that was enclosed in a wrapping similar to that used for candy bars.  Because Kashi products are low in fat and have few ingredients that bind the others together, they do not remain intact during shipping.\n\nI ended up using the crumbled Kashi Cookies Oatmeal Raisin Flax as cereal.

In fact, its flavoring, is quite subtle. The blend has a lot of salt, MSG, etc and can turn out somewhat watery unless you make adjustments.\n\nWhat I found most annoying was the relatively long prep time. First, you really need a LARGE skillet WITH a cover. No - you should not use a pot. Rice-A-Roni specifies a large skillet WITH COVER and for good reason. They want you to brown the rice and that takes a skillet. Then the skillet must be covered. That may or may not be the type of cookware you own.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: First you must get your skillet up to heat and then brown the rice for about 3 minutes using butter or margarine. You can't walk away from this step - it requires constant stirring. Next: add water, the flavor packet and bring it to a full boil. Finally put a cover over your skillet and reduce the heat to a simmer and wait about 20 minutes while you simmer it COVERED.\n\nThe result, at this point, was a rather watery mixture that required even more simmering (uncovered) for yet another 4 minutes. The final result was a rather bland wild rice mixture, heavily laden with salt and a bit of the typical burn of MSG.\n\nIn the end, this wasn't a terrible blend - rather tasteless but hardly worth the effort.\n\nUsing far less effort, I can purchase the equivalent Lipton\/Knorr rice mixture - throw it in a pot and I'm done in about 6 minutes.\n\nI find it difficult to recommend this product.","summary":"Mediocre taste and a fairly long prep time.

It doesn't taste good because it's made from cheap stuff. The taste is pasty rather than rich and savory. When I make my own clam chowder, I use flour and a considerable amount of butter and milk or cream, not soybean oil. Notice in the ingredients list below that cream and butter is less than 1% of this product, which is why this product tastes chalky and bland. It's got the right color, but the wrong taste. The texture is monotonous because it's just the diced potatoes in here that I can taste. Some celery pieces would've given the soup some textural variety. The clam pieces are very few and I don't taste them at all. I don't taste any of the other seafood powder flavorings, so I wonder why Progresso even bothered with them. There's also artificial color in here (white?) and DATEM, which is an emulsifier (keeps the oil from separating out).\n\nIngredients: Clam Broth, Potatoes, Clams, Soybean Oil, Water, Modified Food Starch, Onions. Contains Less than 1% of: Soy Protein Concentrate, Sugar, Salt, Cream, Butter, Sodium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Artificial Color, DATEM, Lobster Powder, Natural Flavor, Shrimp, Crab Powder, Parsley (Dried), Celery (Dried), Fish Powder, Tuna Extract, Spice, Yeast Extract, Corn Protein (Hydrolyzed), Whey.\n\n1 can is 2 servings. Each serving is 180 calories (80 from fat) and 890 mg of sodium (37% of your daily intake). Who eats just half a can of soup?\n\nWalgreens consistently has this on sale for about half the price, so there's no reason to order it from here unless you cannot find this locally and are desperate for bad clam chowder in a can. It's basically just a bland, can of diced potatoes in a white starchy goo, so I don't recommend it at all. There's very little nutrition in here (1g fiber, calcium 2%, iron 4%) and it's mostly just empty calories.

Being a genetic chocoholic (my entire family as far back as we know) I knew I'd try it as soon as it hit the shelves in spite of not being truly satisfied with *any* chocolate flavored cereal - ever - even as a kid.\n\nI purchased a box of each variety and tried the \"plain\" one first. Of course the first thing I had to do was bite one in half to see the chocolate center.  I had to really look to see the very small, thin strip of chocolate on one side of the inside of the hollow pillow.  Nothing like the box photo which seems to show a full chocolate center (could that be considered false advertising?).  I ate a few dry.  They were \"just OK\".  The outer shell is somewhat bland but the chocolate seemed to come through a bit, however nothing as strong or full as I'd expected.  Considering the size of the strip I wasn't totally surprised at this result.  So out comes the milk for a bowl full.  It works OK with milk but has a very odd mouth feel.  Somewhat grainy but the chocolate stood out more and presented a more chocolate flavor than when eaten dry.  It's not a *great* chocolate, tasting much like a chocolate syrup mixed with a chocolate spread, but acceptable for a breakfast cereal having a bit more chocolate flavor than most.  Then the side effects hit.  The chocolate didn't really melt as much as it combined with the shell turning into a paste that stuck to my teeth much like a gummy snack.  Bummer.  Then, after only a few spoonfuls, the shell began to get soggy.  The mouth feel was a bit better when soggy (not as grainy) but the gummy effect seemed to intensify.  I was very disappointed with the cereal and couldn't wait for the box to empty so I could move on to something better.  The sad part is I still have a box of the chocolate outer shell variety that I just can't bring myself to open.\n\nI *did* cut the product coupon off the box just in case the chocolate outer shell version is better than the \"plain\" version.  I have a strong feeling that coupon will expire.","summary":"Another chocolate disappointment","unixReviewTime":1329955200,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

I've heard \"bad things\" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.\n\nBut regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.\n\nDid I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called \"erythritol\" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and\/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol \"shouldn't\" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it \"supposedly\" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.\n\nIf aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the \"bad\" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.","summary":"The taste certainly lacks & it gave me gas and bloating...","unixReviewTime":1302048000,"vote":4.0,"image":null,"style":null}

Kellogg's Cocoa Krispies has been a long time favorite of mine but contains High Fructose Corn Syrup, most likely made from GMO corn. I thought this would be a great substitute.

Bought 4 of these, and have opened 3 so far. The cans are probably 90%+ Peanuts and Almonds. My wife likes Brazil nuts most, and in the first container there was only 2 of them. The second container had ZERO. The third container had 3 and 1\/2 of them. Extremely disappointing. For Pecans there have been an average of 8-10 halves per can. Cashews have a bit more, maybe around 20 of them per can.\n\nOverall the nuts have a good flavor. A lot of the almonds are toasted well, and the flavor really comes through. Just don't buy these cans unless you are fine getting mostly Peanuts and Almonds. Picking out a Cashew or Pecan is a pleasant surprise, not a regular occurrence.

I've heard \"bad things\" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.\n\nBut regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.\n\nDid I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called \"erythritol\" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and\/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol \"shouldn't\" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it \"supposedly\" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.\n\nIf aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the \"bad\" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.","summary":"The taste certainly lacks & it gave me gas and bloating...","unixReviewTime":1302048000,"vote":4.0,"image":null,"style":null}

I am not sure what changes were made to the product but  I have given up using this product completely now. I didn't notice anymore breaking or dryness from it.

From Wen to most recently Tresemme curl hydration. What I always seem to run into is, products that are difficult to wash out. I tried Herbal Essence Hello Hydrantion. I was skeptical about seeing improvements after one shampoo. It sounded too good to be true.\nBoy was I ever surprised, when it turned out to be true!\n\nBest of all it washes out easier then any product  I have ever used. I was very, very impressed by this.

My son was sick, couldn't make it into Costco (where I normally buy paper towels).  Then the AC died, and we had repair dudes in, who were awesome, but in the stress of making sure our son didn't make it out the front door I forgot to put paper towels on the list.  Twice.  And I didn't want to keep sending my husband back out, so I ordered these.  And I've got to say, I'm probably never going to do it again, but I can survive it until they are all used up.\n\nFirst thing you notice when you pull these out of the box is that they are much fuzzier then most brands of paper towels.  I have attached a picture.  It's kind of like felt.  So, this is not desirable, from my perspective, if you are microwaving anything that you would use the paper towel over and don't want fibers stuck to it.  Or drying off an apple that you washed and again, don't want fibers stuck to it.\n\nNext thing is that they tear super, super easy.  Not just when wet.  It tore two holes in the first roll I used just sliding it on our paper towel holder (it brushed up against the shorter bar of it), and this is not normally a problem I have, not with any other brand I've used.  It also comes apart easier when you are wiping up spills, which also isn't something I personally find desirable.  I need my paper towels to hold up to a lot because I am swimming in a constant sea of messes over here.  I have a very naughty kitty who's decided peeing and pooping outside of the litterbox is the world's best form of protest, his sometimes equally naughty feline sidekick, and a son who is a joy but loves to play in the sink and spill things all over pretty much everything.  So my paper towels need to not fall apart, because I use them a lot...and some of it, I don't want my fingers to come into contact with.  It's not quite as bad as toilet paper when it gets wet, but honestly, that's what it reminded me most of the way it started to come apart and turn to mush.\n\nSo, heads up. This was my experience with these in our household.","summary":"Tear easy, very fuzzy, doesn't hold up well to being wet","unixReviewTime":1500336000,"vote":10.0,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61d+gkRaejL._SY88.jpg"],"style":null}

It is time consuming to eat.  It is boring, without much taste, only a little better than eating brown corrugated cardboard.  I mixed it with other cereals like Rice Krispies and Special K to make it more interesting. A normal cereal serving size is 1 cup.  This cereal has a serving size listed as  cup, as one cup of this cereal might be more than you want to deal with.  Sorry, Kellogg's, there just isn't much nice to be said for this cereal. Eat a banana for your Potassium instead.  Kellogg's is playing with the numbers, as a normal one cup serving would yield a high calorie rating of 160mg, a high sodium rating of 160mg, a very high Carbohydrate rating of 46g, and a very high Potassium rating of 700mg.

These were once good tissues but are now just expensive snot rags. These are not the old Kleenex and when they say things like Rely on durable, 2-ply thickness paper tissue sheets & Absorbent, disposable facial tissues lock in moisture its time for a reality check. The old 2-plys were much thicker & more absorbent and you could blow your nose, stick it in a pocket and itd be good to go for another use. One good blow into these and its a wet ball that stays wet while soaking pretty much the whole tissue. Im an average guy about 63 and 210-pounds and when my nose runs these are often good only for a single use but with a few blows they most often have to be tossed. Stick one in my pocket and itll be a solid wad when I pull it out. Ive even had to wash my hands because Im all wet with a single use. My wife is petite and has the same issues with these. I don't have any serious allergies or sinus problems but some mornings itll take 3-tissues to start breathing normally. If you're over 40 you know what I mean about the quality and thickness. Is it healthy to carry around a used tissue... probably not, but I don't care based on what these now cost. I find a paper towel just purchased a case of Sparkle to be much more effective and practical for me they're harsher but I get a lot of mileage for less expense. I think these are now about the equivalent of using the 1000-sheet Scott bathroom tissue on your nose so, perhaps, tissue now defines both products equally and you don't need to call them facial or bathroom. Since many used tissues likely go down the toilet we burn ours they have probably been thinned down to be more sewer system friendly. After complaining about them I will say they are much better than the off brands in the stores that have more per box and more economical than many of the brand names that offer fewer tissues per box. However, the deal of the day at the grocery store will be the way to go because paying a premium for these is just a waste on money. I went with 3-stars because the downsizing and thinning of products is growing tiresome like a 9-ounce potato chip bag that is labeled Family Size so end of rant.","summary":"Caution you can blow through these easily.","unixReviewTime":1485043200,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

This is only diabetic friendly because it is so tiny I can eat a full sized Clif bar and only double the carbs. Yes, calories skyrocket, but lets be honest here...most diabetics don't care much about calories since the carb reduction tends to take care of that for you.\n\nSo, since I see that the carbs are sky-high for such a tiny little thing, I expected nice and real flavor. Instead I get chalky and nasty, like most diabetic food. So We gained only in a small 80 calories. We taste a nasty snack. We get MORE carbs than a larger and tastier fun sized snickers bar (9grams).\n\nYes, you read that correctly. It has MORE THAN DOUBLE the carbs of the larger, better tasting, non-diabetic snack! Heck, a full size snickers, about 6 - 8 of these little things, has only 28grams! Where am I benefiting?\n\nDo not buy.

It's heavy and awkward, plus the sides seem to have baked in food that only a brillo pad removes. So enter these bags, the perfect solution. I ordered several boxes of these with a pantry order. Our kitchen has been torn apart for major remodeling since November and my crock pot has seen heavy use.\nUnfortunately, I've averaged a 25% success rate with these. The other 75% have leaked before the meal was even done. You'd think this was no big deal but it makes the initial problem worse. The layer of liquid and juices from the food is very thin and burns down to a sticky, awful, burnt film very quickly. Removing the leaking liner is a huge mess. I have to have my husband hold the crock pot over the triple lined trash can so I can quickly remove the soggy mess and not leave a drip trail. This is before I've even served any food. Scrubbing that film off is worse than what I've had to scrub off without the liner.\nI gave this two stars because the 1 time in 4 this thing works it's great. The concept is the solution to a nagging problem and I think the product could one day be excellent and a regularly purchased item for me, but not in its current incarnation.

And, although I do not want anything too heavily scented, this product is too lightly fragranced although I do like this particular variety which has a clean, rather than perfume scent. It seemed like a good addition to my prime pantry box.\n\nThe lid twists open but refuses to stay in place, it slips back down to the base. So to prop it open I cut a wooden kitchen skewer into a short length and poked it into the gel extending out a 1\/4 inch or so which prevents the lid from closing. This is a problem I never encountered with any other solid air freshener.

After I had the box completely filled I simply checked out as usual and a few days later it showed up at my house\n\nOverall these items where great and I will be ordering again in the future.

My main dislike is that it was soooooo dusty.  Pouring it in the litter box and scooping the clumps out kicks up so much dust that I will not repurchase it.  I also think the smell of the litter was pleasant for me but possibly a turn off for one of my cats who chose to urinate in front of the box on the mat.

If it's crunchy, I'm sure to have tried it and probably loved it. If you look at my review for Corn Chex, you'll see that I'm a huge fan of the Chex cereals. And Chex Muddy Buddies (soooo gooood). Chex Mix has all the right components- start with an awesome cereal base, add in the right combo of crunchy accessory ingredients, and BAM - you have yourself a perfect snack! But there's something about Chex Mix that leaves my body feeling horrible after I eat too much of it. MSG (Monosodium glutamate) is not listed as an ingredient...but it does have disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate, which are used in conjuction to replace MSG in products. Some believe these two ingredients have a similar effect as MSG on the body - headaches, irritability, discomfort - and that's been my experience as well. Maybe I'm just sensitive, but for that reason I stay away from Chex Mix. I love the crunch...but I hate the unnecessary ingredients.\n\nSome quick facts about the product:\n- The bag arrived a little man-handled - it looked like a bag that would be at the front of the display in the grocery store.

Hill","reviewText":"A convenience food, this instant grits cheese lovers variety is fast and easy comfort food, but the chemical additives, artificial colors and flavors and crazy high sodium level are hard to ignore. I try to avoid monosodium glutamate and failed to notice its inclusion in two of the varieties.\n\nEven if ignoring the ingredient list, the primary flavor is salt. The product is simply too salty. The sodium level in one small packet of any of the three flavors is high  420, 460 or 480 mg  approximately 20 percent of the daily value.\n\nPreparation is easy. Cooking a minute or a minute and fifteen seconds in a microwave with one-half cup water or milk. I tried it with both liquids and the difference in taste and texture was not significant.\n\nI understand snack food having high levels of sodium and including lots of chemical additives, but it just seems a natural grain product should avoid these inclusions as much as possible. In the future I will stick to plain grits and control what is added into the bowl. The best if used before date on the package is four months in the future.","summary":"Quaker Instant Grits Cheese Lovers Selections","unixReviewTime":1468195200,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

But I decided to hold off and try it first.\nGlad I did!\n\nFirst of all, this is a great item to take camping or hiking. If you have a cat, these are about the same size as a can of Fancy Feast.\nThey are small, compact and pop-top.  They are great for putting into your prepping supplies as well - good source of protein.\nI like tuna and thought this would be a great thing for me to also keep upstairs for lunches (mobility problems restrict my access to the kitchen).\n\nWell, I have to be honest. It isn't very good.\nThe tuna is really mushy. The texture is close to unpleasant, in fact. Think if you opened a regular can of tuna and ran it through the food processor, water and all. That's what you'd have. Sort of like tuna paste!  The taste wasn't all that either. I tried adding a little mayo, but that didn't help either. So, I have 23 more cans of tuna paste!  Better than starving, great for camping, and that's about all I can say for it.\n\nOh yeah - great packaging.\nI expected a box with 24 cans in it, like cat food.

Small children could be convinced that it is astronaut food and would enjoy it with one of those little mylar pouches of fruit punch that has a short, pointed straw stuck to the side.\n\nThe tuna salad does not have large chunks of tuna and noticeable bits of celery as shown in the photograph on the box.  It is moist and has a smooth texture except for some bits of cooked celery and water chestnut.  It is not at all fishy but surprisingly sweet and bland, with just a hint of rosemary.  It tastes like it has sweet relish in it, but does not.  It does not taste particularly salty and the garlic is undetectable.  It would benefit from some black pepper.\n\nThere is plenty of tuna salad for each cracker.  The crackers have a mild flavor and are slightly crisp, like a generic Ritz cracker.\n\nThe snack contains 21 g of fat, 7 g of protein, and 20 g of carbohydrates, as well as 445 mg of sodium and 300 calories.","summary":"Junior astronaut food","unixReviewTime":1475625600,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

They were giving away tiny paper cups of it. I suspect I was pretty hungry at the time.

We stock up on a number of items like this to have food on hand for \"emergency\" purposes when forgetting to go to the grocery store. Plus it's an item that might be useful on camping trips.\n\nThe clam chowder is OK, but I wouldn't rank it among the better ones i've had. It's rather pasty, somewhat tasteless and the clams seem rather sparse. It will work in an emergency, and that's how we treat it. I'd say the sodium content is much too high and the protein content is not high enough. It's just not the best soup. Well our other use was for camping. After a long day of hiking, etc., it's real easy to prepare and, man, it can taste mighty good out in the open air. Well, I have mixed feelings about this product.

It is almost like drinking seawater. This soup is not for anyone on a low salt diet, like anyone with high blood pressure or water retention problems.

There is another ingredient I sometimes add and that is a bacon bits.  Real bacon adds that extra flavor to make the chowder to give it that real chowder taste. Fortunately there is a manufacturer that has real bacon bits. Just add a teaspoon along with the extra clams while the chowder is simmering on low heat.

I was excited to try it, because I like to make chili myself, but sometimes it is just convenient to open up a can.  My favorite is Van Camp's which I grew up eating, but I can't always find it anymore.  I was disappointed to find out that Hormel made this, because I do not like their regular chili at all.  This one is, at least, better quality in appearance than their regular chili.  The meat looked like meat, and these beans were cooked just right.\nTo me, this is a very tomato based chili, with a good mixture of beans to meat, and a bit light on the onion.  I find it a bit watery to use on hot dogs and chili cheese fries, which are my main reasons for opening up a can of chili.\nI probably won't order it again, but I didn't dislike it.

I didn't have any other strong cooking orders going on at the time.\nToday the scent was very pleasant. Identifiably Basmati.  I heated a bowl with some Siraracha and a sprinkle of parm cheese and other than the rice being slightly underdone and a bit al dente it was pretty good. The flavor had time to develop overnight (I guess) and it was pretty good.\nIt didn't have that cardboardy taste this afternoon,  So I'm thinking I need to increase the amount of water slightly and see what that does.\nI just wished it tasted like it did today last night.\n\nWe eat a lot of rice in our household, many types from Black rice to off the shelf cheapy stuff.\nThis Lundberg Basmati rice had a lot of green rice and some husks, it was clean though, there was no clouding of the water as I was washing it.\nI used the recommended amount of water and a bit of butter in my rice cooker. An old style Zoji.\nThe rice smelled like brown rice as it cooked,  It didn't have the nice scent of Basmati at all.\nWhen it was done, the rice had stuck to the bottom of the rice pot. Something that rarely happens here.\nThe rice tasted like cardboard. Not even a hint of basmati flavor that I could discern.\nEven my husband commented that the rice tasted odd.\noh well.  This product is off my list.

There may be less expensive vendors available on Amazon, and it may be even less expensive than that in the supermarkets.\n\nThis very good unsweetened dark green tea has a heavy taste, and it would benefit from adding some ice water or ice to it in a glass to thin it out a bit, like some bottled black teas. The heavy concentration of tea also adds to its acidity. It does have a bit of a grassy taste, common in many green teas, but especially so in dark green teas. There is also a bit of Matcha  tea powder grittiness, which takes away the smoothness of the green tea.  Processed foods in general contain far too much sugar and salt, but this product does not contain any sugar, making it a healthier beverage to drink.\nThis dark green tea is an acquired taste. It contains powdered tea leaf residue, similar to Matcha tea, and has a slightly gritty mouth feel to it due to the presence of the leaf residue. It also contains 30mg of Sodium (salt) per serving, or 60mg of salt for the whole bottle, something that does not improve the taste of any tea. I am not sure if the salt is added as a preservative, but if it is, it should be reduced to 10mg or even 5mg, the way bottled teas used to be sold.\n\nOn the plus side, it does not contain any sweeteners, food coloring, or flavoring. The only additives are Sodium and Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). Matcha tea lovers will probably give this tea a higher rating, but overall, this is not quite my cup of tea, and I can only give it three Amazon stars.\n\nThe Nutrition Facts, and Ingredients, as listed on the container:\n\nNutrition Facts:\nServing Size 8 fl. oz.

Something about the flavor immediately rubs me the wrong way.  Every few years I attempt them again due to their popularity and the fact people in my family love eating them so there's always a box sitting around, but for me personally I prefer other Nabisco products.  Not sure if others out there feel the same way.  It's not like Nabisco is doing something wrong since most of their products are amazing.  I usually like wheat flavored foods too.  This is going to go down as one of those unexplainable mysterious things I suppose, haha.  Oh well, with so much cracker variety on the market there's no point in getting caught up with my dislike of Nabisco Wheat Thins.  I guess we all have foods we hate that other love.  Another would be jelly beans.  I can't stand them but others love them.  I especially dislike the black ones and yet people I know think the black ones are the best so I don't know guys.

So then the question becomes, are its prices and offerings of comparable value?  Answer for most common things, is 'yes'.  So here, you have essentially two TUNA choices, Bumble Bee or Chicken of the Sea.  So I got both.  And of the two, you have chunk light, and albacore, the latter allgedly being better and more expensive.  So I got both.\n\nNO DIFFERENCE between them that I can taste.  NO DIFFERENCE between the two albacores, that I can see.  Scant difference in calories per 2 oz serving, with Chicken of the Sea a tad lower.\n\nSo the only difference, is price.  I see no justification for the Bumble Bee 'gold', which is about 20% higher in price, versus Bumble Bee albacore regular, which is of the same price as Chicken of the Sea albacore.  They all look and taste the same.  Surprisingly, there's no difference in taste (but a difference in looks) with the chunk light tuna.  But no difference, between the brands or within the brands.  The 12 oz is a better buy in price.\n\nThey are all tasteless canned tuna.  Fresh tuna tastes like heaven.  So canned tuna is what you use to get protein, for a sandwich (mackerel is far better, even for that or just on its own).  Duke's Mayo is far superior (more eggy), compared to the more popular brands, and is not sold in Prime Pantry, pity.  That's the only way I know of to drown out the dry blah canned tuna taste.  Or, mix in a tsp of Hoosier Hill's cheese powder (any flavor).\n\nIn short, canned tuna is bleh.  All tasting the same so get the cheapest, unless you're making a salad others will see, in which case spring for the albacore.","summary":"Same price same product as competitors","unixReviewTime":1418774400,"vote":2.0,"image":null,"style":null}

It left no smell behind, but I usually prefer that my clothes smell of my perfume not fabric softener, so that's a plus for me. I would describe the scent straight from the bottle of lavender, with a stale hint. I did not noticed any static while using it and clothes were easy to iron.\nI really appreciate this being a product that's better for the environment, but other similar products are better in terms of softening.\nThe description says two capfuls per rinse cycle, but on the bottle it says `fill to middle of ridge` for regular loads.

I don't remember ever remarking on the consistency of the raisins in my cereal before, so this was a first.\n\nThe only times I've had raisins this chewy were when they'd been sitting out for a while and gone stale. This box was freshly opened, so freshness was not the problem. Without exaggeration, the raisins are almost as dense and tough as pencil erasers. (I squeezed both with my fingers to compare.) The flakes are good and satisfyingly crunchy, but the raisins will give your jaws a good workout.\n\nAs for the health benefits of this cereal, I have no doubts. Health professionals recommend getting 25-35g of fiber a day for an average adult, so the 11g per serving in here goes a long way towards the total (28%).

And the number of servings and the number of calories per servings is always included in the nutritional information on the container.  However I have noticed on Amazon that this is not the case.  When the nutritional information is shown it's \"ONE\" serving, in this case 18 grams.  How unhelpful is that?  They make it a process to find out how many calories are in this bag of mangoes, for example.  They tell you how many calories are in 18 grams; I personally think it's an attempt at deception or misleading if you want to be kind by the vendor.  In any case, there are 204 calories in one bag.  one ounce = 28.349 grams; 2.2 ounces per bag X 28.349 = 62.368 grams; 62.368 grams\/18 = 3.465 servings per bag.  3.465 X 59 calories per 18 grams = 204.428 calories.  I'm going to ask Amazon to ask the vendors that when they say they are including the information on the product in the description that they provide all of it and part of this is the number of servings contained.  I believe that the vendors are required by law to provide the number of servings on the container but I'm not sure about online.  This is conveniently left out; plus, who the heck deals with servings in grams?  When is the last time you measured out a serving in grams?

While I don't want my kids eating cereal every day, I feel that at least this is a decent option for breakfast when needed in a hurry.\n\nThat said, this cereal has a meh taste.  It's basically the Gorilla Munch cereal with some cinnamon on it, but if the cereal sits in the milk, rice milk, etc. for more than a minute the flavoring comes off & it is very plain.  If you don't mind something plain with a mild cinnamon hint to it after adding it to milk, you'll probably like this.  But if you want your cereal to maintain the yummy flavor filled taste even when milk is added, like their Peanut Butter Panda Puffs (YUMMMMM!!!), you may be disappointed.  This started out at $2.75 a box via S&S but quickly went up to $4.25 a box the next month.  I am not ordering any more & cancelled my subscription.\n\nI gave it 3 stars for being a great company with great products & coming out with a new flavor of cereal.  I took off 2 stars because the cereal lacks cinnamon flavor once milk is added... and since that is typically how cereal is eaten, with milk, I don't think taking away 2 stars is unreasonable, for the flavor basically disappearing when wet.

The cheddar flavoring is intense in these; they are quite delicious.  I once found them to be a healthy and relatively low-caloric snack.  I miss them.\n\nI would give this product, and all Nut Thin flavors, a five-star rating because of the great taste but I cannot.  I know many of  you will be mad at me for rating this product as I have and will thereby consider my review unhelpful, but... so be it.  I have principles that I must remain true to.  Here is why I downgraded the rating from five to three stars:\n\nWhen I buy a food product, I want to have confidence in the company which manufacturers that food.  Unfortunately, that is no longer the case with Blue Diamond's products.\n\nIt has recently come to my attention that Blue Diamond Growers (makes of Nut Thins) has joined in the campaign to stop GMO labeling, by supporting and contributing to Monsanto's and other mega-agricultural interests' efforts to prevent people, that is---you and me, from being given label-information that will inform us to what we are eating and help us make smart and healthy food choices.  Those of us who actually read labels, that is.\n\nIt's unfortunate that this company is not supporting GMO-labeling.  I would probably buy these crackers even if the label stated, \"may contain GMOs,\" but I feel I have the right to know, as do you.  Health food and organic companies have included responsible labeling for a long time, and there is no reason why these other major food manufacturers shouldn't follow suit.  They change their packaging, including their labeling, all the time, so they cannot say it would be a heavy financial burden to do this.  Blue Diamond should support and respect the intelligence of its customer base.  It apparently doesn't.  By trying to quash efforts to pass laws requiring GMO-labeling, and in many cases, attempting to reverse the laws that some states have recently passed requiring GMO labeling, Blue Diamond is showing that it cares more about its own interests rather than the public's interest which it serves.\n\nFor that reason, solely for that reason, I cannot recommend these Nut Thins and will no longer be purchasing them.","summary":"Will No Longer Buy These (Alas, because they are tasty!).","unixReviewTime":1406764800,"vote":19.0,"image":null,"style":null}

I first tried one tablet in a very lightly soiled dishwasher load with the \"Heavy\" setting and there were a few ceramic plates that did not come out \"spotless\", but clean enough to just rinse and wipe off. I then later tried 2 of the Ecover tablets in a more soiled Dishwasher load on the \"Heavy\" setting and had considerably more dishes that were still dirty. My other Cascade Platinum tablets (not just the \"Complete\", but the \"Platinum\" type, there IS a difference) seem to handle quite a bit more than these tablets do. Even though these tablets are a \"Naturally Derived\" product and are considerably cheaper, the use of water needed to clean the dishes with more than one cycle, or pre\/post rinse negates any ecological and cost savings benefits, in my opinion. These might be great for simply washing cups or cereal bowls, perhaps lightly soiled silverware too, but I wouldn't use these to try and remove anything like melted cheese, microwaved sauce drops or anything of that nature.","summary":"Meh.

The placement of the cutting blade is awkward...you have to hold the entire thing on a very awkward angle to physically see what you are doing. Further (as others have noted), you really need to pull HARD at a strong upward angle to get it to cut...doing this sometimes results in the piece you are cutting stretching, and then  wrinkling up as it snaps back after being cut, which can render the piece you just cut useless unless you want to attempt to untangle what just happened. Finally, the design sometimes results in the roll itself accumulating a small amount of wrap on the outer edge of the roll, eventually resulting in you needing to remove the roll from the box, and remove this accumulation. The cutting system is probably like this for safety purposes, but I find it makes using Cling Wrap much more frustrating than other products I have used.\n\nWith this kind of product that you frequently interact with, the delivery system is just as important as the product given you are interacting with it all of the time, and this is the make or break of convenience. I like Glad's wrap more than the Kirkland wrap I use, but the Kirkland has a much easier delivery system. As I use clear wrap like 3+ times a day, the additional time & effort to use Glad's Cling Wrap over others adds up...and so as much as I like the wrap, this is not a product I will be purchasing in the future. Glad is making a great quality wrap, but I hope that in the near future they change the packaging.","summary":"Great quality wrap...terrible delivery system - compared to others brands, usage is more difficult\/frustrating","unixReviewTime":1409529600,"vote":2.0,"image":null,"style":null}

The only downside to this is the portion ratio of the variety of nuts in this can, see in the one I received its mainly peanuts and almonds and I am sure this is portion ratio used in every can, I see a few cashews and I hardly see any pecans. From what I see the portions ration could be 50% peanuts, 40% almond, cashews 5%, pecans 1 to 2%, and a mixture of the remaining Brazil and hazelnuts. This is a good price but I honestly do not see myself buying this again as it mostly contain peanuts and almonds.

This box was freshly opened, so freshness was not the problem. Without exaggeration, the raisins are almost as dense and tough as pencil erasers. (I squeezed both with my fingers to compare.) The flakes are good and satisfyingly crunchy, but the raisins will give your jaws a good workout.\n\nAs for the health benefits of this cereal, I have no doubts. Health professionals recommend getting 25-35g of fiber a day for an average adult, so the 11g per serving in here goes a long way towards the total (28%).

And the number of servings and the number of calories per servings is always included in the nutritional information on the container.  However I have noticed on Amazon that this is not the case.  When the nutritional information is shown it's \"ONE\" serving, in this case 18 grams.  How unhelpful is that?  They make it a process to find out how many calories are in this bag of mangoes, for example.  They tell you how many calories are in 18 grams; I personally think it's an attempt at deception or misleading if you want to be kind by the vendor.  In any case, there are 204 calories in one bag.  one ounce = 28.349 grams; 2.2 ounces per bag X 28.349 = 62.368 grams; 62.368 grams\/18 = 3.465 servings per bag.  3.465 X 59 calories per 18 grams = 204.428 calories.  I'm going to ask Amazon to ask the vendors that when they say they are including the information on the product in the description that they provide all of it and part of this is the number of servings contained.  I believe that the vendors are required by law to provide the number of servings on the container but I'm not sure about online.

While I don't want my kids eating cereal every day, I feel that at least this is a decent option for breakfast when needed in a hurry.\n\nThat said, this cereal has a meh taste.  It's basically the Gorilla Munch cereal with some cinnamon on it, but if the cereal sits in the milk, rice milk, etc. for more than a minute the flavoring comes off & it is very plain.  If you don't mind something plain with a mild cinnamon hint to it after adding it to milk, you'll probably like this.  But if you want your cereal to maintain the yummy flavor filled taste even when milk is added, like their Peanut Butter Panda Puffs (YUMMMMM!!!), you may be disappointed.

I believe it is the weakest out of the other cereals I have tried like Gorilla Munch or Panda Puffs.\n\nUltimately the box design changed they did not even care to mention the \"New design same taste\" disclaimer.

The cheddar flavoring is intense in these; they are quite delicious.  I once found them to be a healthy and relatively low-caloric snack.  I miss them.\n\nI would give this product, and all Nut Thin flavors, a five-star rating because of the great taste but I cannot.  I know many of  you will be mad at me for rating this product as I have and will thereby consider my review unhelpful, but... so be it.  I have principles that I must remain true to.  Here is why I downgraded the rating from five to three stars:\n\nWhen I buy a food product, I want to have confidence in the company which manufacturers that food.  Unfortunately, that is no longer the case with Blue Diamond's products.\n\nIt has recently come to my attention that Blue Diamond Growers (makes of Nut Thins) has joined in the campaign to stop GMO labeling, by supporting and contributing to Monsanto's and other mega-agricultural interests' efforts to prevent people, that is---you and me, from being given label-information that will inform us to what we are eating and help us make smart and healthy food choices.  Those of us who actually read labels, that is.\n\nIt's unfortunate that this company is not supporting GMO-labeling.  I would probably buy these crackers even if the label stated, \"may contain GMOs,\" but I feel I have the right to know, as do you.  Health food and organic companies have included responsible labeling for a long time, and there is no reason why these other major food manufacturers shouldn't follow suit.  They change their packaging, including their labeling, all the time, so they cannot say it would be a heavy financial burden to do this.  Blue Diamond should support and respect the intelligence of its customer base.  It apparently doesn't.  By trying to quash efforts to pass laws requiring GMO-labeling, and in many cases, attempting to reverse the laws that some states have recently passed requiring GMO labeling, Blue Diamond is showing that it cares more about its own interests rather than the public's interest which it serves.\n\nFor that reason, solely for that reason, I cannot recommend these Nut Thins and will no longer be purchasing them.","summary":"Will No Longer Buy These (Alas, because they are tasty!).","unixReviewTime":1406764800,"vote":19.0,"image":null,"style":null}

My guess is that particles are settling out of the sauce and hardening on the bottom.  If so, there's really no danger to it, but it's not very appealing to me.\n\nIf you get a fresh batch and go through it fairly quickly, or don't mind clumps settling out of it, then I think it's a good deal.

I then later tried 2 of the Ecover tablets in a more soiled Dishwasher load on the \"Heavy\" setting and had considerably more dishes that were still dirty. My other Cascade Platinum tablets (not just the \"Complete\", but the \"Platinum\" type, there IS a difference) seem to handle quite a bit more than these tablets do. Even though these tablets are a \"Naturally Derived\" product and are considerably cheaper, the use of water needed to clean the dishes with more than one cycle, or pre\/post rinse negates any ecological and cost savings benefits, in my opinion.

On that quest in shopping Amazon Pantry, I came across Wolfgang Puck's Organic Chicken with Wild Rice soup. I thought to myself, it's Wolfgang Puck, so it's got to be delicious, right? Not exactly.\n\nFirst off, I was disappointed when I got the shipment. The can was MUCH smaller than I expected. Think Campbell's small soup can. I figured for the price, it would be a bigger can. BUT, I will admit, this was entirely my fault, as I did not pay attention to the ounces in the can before ordering.\n\nThat being said, I popped open the can to prepare lunch, expecting at least a FEW pieces of chicken and vegetables mixed in with the broth and rice. Not so. I would guestimate at least 80% of the soup is broth and rice. I counted 2 small chicken chunks. After trying it, the flavor was lack-luster. I can't even describe it, it was just very bland.

The placement of the cutting blade is awkward...you have to hold the entire thing on a very awkward angle to physically see what you are doing. Further (as others have noted), you really need to pull HARD at a strong upward angle to get it to cut...doing this sometimes results in the piece you are cutting stretching, and then  wrinkling up as it snaps back after being cut, which can render the piece you just cut useless unless you want to attempt to untangle what just happened. Finally, the design sometimes results in the roll itself accumulating a small amount of wrap on the outer edge of the roll, eventually resulting in you needing to remove the roll from the box, and remove this accumulation. The cutting system is probably like this for safety purposes, but I find it makes using Cling Wrap much more frustrating than other products I have used.\n\nWith this kind of product that you frequently interact with, the delivery system is just as important as the product given you are interacting with it all of the time, and this is the make or break of convenience. I like Glad's wrap more than the Kirkland wrap I use, but the Kirkland has a much easier delivery system. As I use clear wrap like 3+ times a day, the additional time & effort to use Glad's Cling Wrap over others adds up...and so as much as I like the wrap, this is not a product I will be purchasing in the future. Glad is making a great quality wrap, but I hope that in the near future they change the packaging.","summary":"Great quality wrap...terrible delivery system - compared to others brands, usage is more difficult\/frustrating","unixReviewTime":1409529600,"vote":2.0,"image":null,"style":null}

I give this product 5 stars in regards to the price and fast delivery, the price is a bargain compared to a regular size can of Planters mixed nuts. The only downside to this is the portion ratio of the variety of nuts in this can, see in the one I received its mainly peanuts and almonds and I am sure this is portion ratio used in every can, I see a few cashews and I hardly see any pecans. From what I see the portions ration could be 50% peanuts, 40% almond, cashews 5%, pecans 1 to 2%, and a mixture of the remaining Brazil and hazelnuts. This is a good price but I honestly do not see myself buying this again as it mostly contain peanuts and almonds.

Amazon's price was as cheap as my local store so I bought a few cans.\nThe best thing I can say about it is, well, it's convenient and relatively inexpensive.\nTaste? What there is of it is mildly fishy. Not in a bad 'old' fishy way, just a bit fishy. It might be called Chicken of the Sea, but there is no mistaking it for anything but tuna fish from a can.\n\nAfter getting the American tuna, this is pretty bad, but this is a fraction of the cost. My cans had an even mix of chunks and flakes. Better than the no name store brands. Another good thing is the long shelf life. It seems like the dates on tuna cans are always later than other canned goods like vegetables or soups.\n\nIf you really like tuna, the American one is a nice splurge once in a while, but this is an ok everyday tuna for casseroles and tuna melts.","summary":"Everyday  Tuna","unixReviewTime":1423526400,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

I guess it is the protein....anyway, the tuna is good, though I couldn't really discern rosemary, garlic or sea salt as dominating flavors, so if you are looking for a big flavor explosion, you won't get that.  What you will get is a nicely flavored tuna salad, much like you would make at home, not just a can of dry, flavored tuna.  My one drawback on this one was a small one.  Not enough crackers.  I had to really heap the tuna on the crackers-I believe there were 6 to use most of it and still ended up eating some out of the container, so a few more crackers would be good.  The crackers are Ritz like and go well with the tuna.  Other than not enough of them, they went well with the kit.\n\nOverall, I would purchase this in this flavor or others to keep as a quick pack to take on a hike, eat as an emergency lunch or to just have on hand.

They are a good sized soft cookie and you can break them off in smaller bits and not have them crumble.  Just sweet enough, but not so sugar sweet as many store-bought cookies.  You can also definitely feel the chew of the oatmeal and the chocolate doesn't have that cheap taste.  I honestly enjoyed them, enough that I had trouble just stopping with one.\n\nYes, these cookies are soft, but if you want them to stay that way you have to seal them back up again if possible once you open the package.  An old fashioned cookie tin would be just the thing, or even a sealable bag.\n\nI wouldn't say these are the absolute best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie I've ever had--that remains in the realm of home-made cookies, specifically a \"secret\" recipe taught to me by a relative--but if you aren't into spending an afternoon baking cookies and need to grab a box of more than decent cookies to take with, then this might be the one for you.

It tastes wonderful, nothing like many other boxed macaroni and cheese mixes. The white cheddar makes all the difference here. It almost tastes homemade. It is creamy and quite hard to resist. Which is a problem because it is high in calories and fat and pretty low in any sort of real nutrition. It has a lot of junk ingredients too but man, oh, man, now and then it is worth the extra calories to dig in and enjoy this cheap and easy side dish. I always look for things that are healthy and low in fat and this really is neither but life isn't black or white. Now and then, I want some good macaroni and cheese and I don't want to spend time making it from scratch. I don't eat this often but I totally enjoy it when I do. Then I diet for two days after! I do use 2% milk instead of whole milk and it tastes just as good so I save on calories and fat a bit doing that. Skim milk waters down the taste.

This is 150 calories per serving, and I prefer the calories to be closer to 100. Of course this isn't advertised as a light soup either. My wife recently tried combining a can of this with a can of the Light Chicken and Dumpling. The result was a pleasing lunch at an average of only 115 calories per bowl.\n\nThere is no question that this is a good tasting soup. We used to be strictly Campbell's customers, but discovered many Progresso soups earlier this year as we explored alternatives which would complement our new style of eating (losing weight instead of gaining weight! LOL). To our delight we found, on average, Progresso soups seem to be lower calorie, lower sodium, and better flavored than Campbells. There are a couple of Campbell's that we still like better (New England Clam Chowder, for example) but other than just a few exceptions Progresso has the bulk of our soup business now.\n\nSadly, Amazon has recently raised their prices on all Progresso soups. Last summer and fall they were considerably more cost effective to buy 12 at a time on Amazon. Now the Amazon prices are quite similar to the prices at the upscale super-market we patronize. Even the Subscribe and Save prices are not currently much of a deal compared to buying locally, and locally we don't have to buy a case at a time. Be sure to compare your local prices to these prices before you order here. Also, make sure you are getting free shipping or you will pay more. Finally, be very wary of buying food products from Amazon Resellers. Their prices are normally extremely high compared to local markets, plus they will always have shipping added.","summary":"Good soup, but the calories are a bit high","unixReviewTime":1326585600,"vote":6.0,"image":null,"style":null}

My family eats a lot of rice and the more I read about arsenic levels in rice the more concerned I became and I was happy to find out that there is rice available from areas that are fairly reliable when it comes to lower arsenic levels, but I remain concerned about the levels in all brown rices.  Lundberg brown basmati rice has always been very tasty and aromatic but we will eat less of it, while I wait for more research to come out about the harmful effects of higher arsenic levels vs the benefits of brown over white rice. Lundberg more than any other rice grower has responded with concern and is doing their own research into lowering arsenic levels in the rice, which I appreciate as a consumer.  I'm still giving this 4 stars because it is superior over other brands.\n\nEdit:  I should mention that according to consumer reports Lundberg's brown rice has lower levels of arsenic than many other brands of white rice.","summary":"Aromatic and tasty brown rice, but we will eat less brown rice in general due to arsenic level concerns","unixReviewTime":1456185600,"vote":6.0,"image":null,"style":null}

Keefer","reviewText":"If you want to add variety to your diet, this unsweetened blue diamond almond breeze is a healthy substitute to milk.  I use it on oatmeal and in my coffee.  There is zero sugar in this milk, and only 30 calories.  Only 1g of protein.  But it is rich in calcium, vitamin D and vitamin E.  25% Vitamin D, 45% Calcium, Vitamin 50%.  You can sweeten it with natural, no-calorie stevia.\n\nI use it to make iced coffee mocha: one cup cold coffee, one cup almond milk, one cup low fat milk, 1 tsp. cocoa, stevia to taste and 8-10 ice cubes.  Blend in the blender and it makes 3+ cups of delicious drink for less than 200 calories.  Yum!  And it's all healthy for you.\n\nIngredients for this almond include:  ALMOND MILK (FILTERED WATER, ALMONDS), CALCIUM CARBONATE, SEA SALT, POTASSIUM CITRATE, CARRAGEENAN, SUNFLOWER LECITHIN, NATURAL FLAVOR, VITAMIN A PALMITATE, VITAMIN D2 AND D-ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL (NATURAL VITAMIN E).\n\nAm looking for pure almond milk, if it exists, but in the meantime like this brand of almond milk.","summary":"Low Calorie ~ Great to Make Iced Coffee Mochas","unixReviewTime":1426896000,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

I was looking to add a little bit of fiber to my diet without breaking the bank (in terms of calories, that is).  I wanted to feel like I was getting a lot to eat, which is something popcorn always does for me.\n\nI find this basically pretty good.  It is not the most delicious microwave popcorn I've ever had, but it is certainly acceptable for a reduced fat product.  It's salty without being overly salty, though there is a fair amount of sodium if you look at the nutrition facts label -- about 10% of your daily recommended maximum.  (You can see the full nutrition facts panel if you zoom in on the product images.)\n\nI did not have many unpopped kernels.  There were a few.  However, I did overcook this the first time...  I can't say how long you should let it pop because that will vary based on your microwave.  (For me, the ideal time was around two minutes.)  I would strongly recommend staying in the room so you can hear the rate of popping, though.  There was a fair amount that got stuck in my teeth, so if you have problems with that, you may want some floss or a toothpick or something similar handy.\n\nA lot of the \"butter\" flavor stuck to the bottom of the package.  I suppose that cuts down on the number of calories and amount of salt that I consumed, though I *may* have run my finger over that part of the package a few times to get a taste of that stuff.  I would like it if more of that ended up on the popcorn, although the flavor was OK as is.\n\nIn the end, this provided a filling snack and was a reasonable compromise between flavor and calorie content, so I can't complain.  I would buy this again.","summary":"reasonable compromise between flavor and calorie content","unixReviewTime":1470873600,"vote":3.0,"image":null,"style":null}

They don't leak. They do fine in the microwave. They do great in the dishwasher. They also cost about 6 times what these cost. I am budget conscious, and those were a gift. I lose lids. I bring dishes somewhere and then forget them. These storage containers are prefect for me because they are cheap and get the job done. Do they leak? Sure, sometimes. Do they work well in the microwave? Not particularly--they will heat in the microwave but doing so for too long seems to badly warp them. I am guessing it can also melt them. They work in the freezer. They can go into the dishwasher. Eventually the lids warp, but it's not a big ordeal for what I use these for (mostly storing fruits and vegetables for my kid to bring to school). You get what you pay for, and these are great for the budget conscious.","summary":"They do fine in the microwave","unixReviewTime":1457308800,"vote":3.0,"image":null,"style":null}

The oats are always fine, a reliable brand, and the price was average.  I can't rate the quality of this particular one though.  I made the mistake of ordering a couple of boxed food items with some other supplies in Prime Pantry.  I usually don't do that but I have always been happy with Amazon packing and shipping.  Unfortunately there simply wasn't enough packing material to keep items from tipping over and shifting around and glass cleaner tipped over onto the oats and leaked.  And I don't understand why the oats weren't placed in the other side of the divider with the other box of food which suffered no damage.  Personally I don't think Amazon should allow us to order chemicals and cleaning supplies together in the same box as food items.  I know I won't do it again and take partial responsibility.  I did file a packing complaint and I threw out the contaminated oats.","summary":"Good product, poor packing.","unixReviewTime":1516492800,"vote":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71rPERksc4L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51QtPbw3tjL._SY88.jpg"],"style":null}

I haven't eaten oatmeal in years but I  like it well enough. I bought this container because I don't like the packets with all the extra sugar and fake flavors and I am pleased with the taste and how easy it is to prepare. But the container is super small. I didn't realize how few servings an 18 ounce container would be. I would have to buy this every week or more just for myself and my husband who occasionally has some. But I guess that was my bad. I didn't really look at the servings per container. We always had these big containers of oatmeal when I was a kid and they lasted a long time. I am almost done with this container and it's only been a short while. Walmart has the 42 ounce canisters for just $1.00 more I will buy my oatmeal there from now on.\n\nBut that aside, the taste is great, the small amount of fat is poly and mono which are both good fats with just a touch of saturated which isn't. In all, a very healthy and versatile product. I will be buying the the big container though because the large container is a better deal and I won't have to buy it as often.","summary":"Taste great and is healthy but the container is way smaller than I thought it would be.

At some point some genius said why not pack it in water. Tuna in a can has never been quite the same since. I bought this type in oil to feed a high protein treat to my cats on an occasion. My fussy kitties though seem to prefer the tuna in water version better. While this version is less expensive, the oil has to be drained off first before serving it, which is a messy, smelly process. With the tuna in water the cats also love to lick-up the water broth. No need to drain it. The water version tastes so good to me that it's almost too good to waste on cats. But I think in the future I will pay the extra cost for the packed in water version.

Then we started noticing that light tuna seemed to be dark and the taste was strong. So we switched to the Solid White Albacore and found that  most BUT not all cans we actually did receive white tuna. I don't understand why some cans in the same package have such different kinds of meat int eh can. Then what ticked us of even moire was noticing the diminishing size of the cans. Now the same cans are getting so small that if you make a tuna salad it will probably only be enough to serve tow people instead of four. Then to make matters worse the prices have increased in the past few years to where tuna is now becoming a gourmet item at the table.

It smells like lavender essential oil. That being said, if you don't actually like lavender essential oil, this is NOT the product for you. It seems to do a good job keeping clothes fluffy, and I like that it's very concentrated. You only use about a tablespoon for a normal size load. I do NOT like the cap. The cap has the normal screw portion, plus a piece that goes down deep inside the neck of the bottle. I'm guessing this is to prevent extra product from leaking through the threads and spilling. I've seen other brands with similar caps, but this one uses twice the plastic and makes measuring the product odd. The full load measuring line is half of the capacity of the weird lid (i.e.: at the threads, where the weird neck portion SHOULD stop). I couldn't figure out why we were using it so quickly (we don't have THAT much laundry). Eventually I figured out that my S.O. had been filling the full lid and literally using twice the amount recommended.

The first thing I noticed was the salt...a bit too salty for me.

It had a good salmon taste and smell.  My blind kitty headed right for the smell as I opened the packet...she likes it too.  Pretty expensive for kitty food but nothing but the best for her, she ate the little I gave her, then my other kitty came in to clean up the rest.  I would have rated this higher if it wasn't so salty.  It's convenient and easy to use and for just me eating it, I like the packets better than a can, I just roll the top down and put it in the refrigerator for tomorrow's lunch.\n\nConclusion: I will use this more for a salmon salad as opposed to eating it straight, the saltiness will be better handled with mayo to calm the saltiness.

Most common brands add soy and a lot of the supposed organic brands do as well - this is entirely unnecessary, soy is considered one of the top eight most serious food allergies, like milk and shellfish. So far, Peter Pan has been reliably safe for me to eat and tastes great, but I am glad to find this Skippy Natural is soy free and provides another option.\n\nMy initial impression is very good. The peanut butter is creamy and smells good as soon as the jar is opened and there's no oily skin on the surface. It spreads easily on a slice of bread like it should. The flavor is good - peanutty with a little sweetness, but no burned or scorched aftertaste. It makes a perfectly fine sandwich with grape jelly.\n\nThe ingredients comparison between this Skippy and Peter Pan are pretty simple as well. Personally, I could care less about the type of oil because the absence of soy is a life threatening issue. Though the use of palm oil is absolutely not ecologically friendly and is the number one reason for destruction of the Asian rain forests.\n\nSkippy: Roasted Peanuts, sugar, Palm oil, salt.\nPeter Pan: Roasted Peanuts, sugar, less than 2%hydrogenated oils (rapeseed and cottonseed), salt.","summary":"Soy free for the allergic!!

Among the basic go-to brands, we agree that Jif Natural has a more robust roasted peanut taste. This Skippy seems a little bland by comparison, although it has that same classic Skippy taste, meaning we detected no real difference taste-wise between this natural version and the regular (hydrogenated oils) version. Per a two tablespoon serving, Skippy Natural has 3.5 grams of saturated fat (other brands have 2.5 or 3 roughly), and 3 grams of sugar. We found that the Skippy Natural with Honey (5 grams of sugar) tastes better all around.\n\nSkippy Natural may never be our absolute favorite peanut butter brand, though it does offer a recognizably pleasing peanut taste, no hydrogenated oils, and a good value compared to more boutique natural brands. If your family is thinking about going \"natural,\" at least with peanut butter, Skippy is worth a shot.","summary":"No hydrogenated oils, good peanut taste","unixReviewTime":1472860800,"vote":4.0,"image":null,"style":null}

However, the fact that there is no need to stir means that it has been homogenized, and that is hardly a natural process. It is a chemical process that involves fusing and changing molecular structure (in a nutshell), and these types of changes are not \"natural.\"\nAlso, the palm oil in this peanut butter may or may not be ok. I am happy that it is not canola oil. However, there is nothing stating that it is expeller or cold pressed, and that does make a huge difference. Oils heated to high heat become rancid, resulting in the release of free radicals in the body. The beneficial properties are lost, and these types of oils can cause various types of disease. Generally, when the oils are cold and expeller pressed, the product would state such.\nBut this is probably one of the best compromises between taste, texture, and still being somewhat natural. So if you like the convenience of not having to stir the separated peanut butter and oil, and want something pretty natural and great tasting, this is a wonderful choice.\nI paid full price for this item.

He prefers this particular Old Spice fragrance over some of the other Old Spice offerings in that it is not as overwhelming scent wise.  Hey Old Spice, if it wasn't broke, why did you mess with the scent?  Old Spice used to offer a body wash that smelled like their eons old original Old Spice after shave but if it is still produced it apparently is not available in our area.  Still, he likes the Old Spice better than some of those gosh awful smells of others such as e.g., Axe or those that emit a musk odor.  Ugh.

However, within a couple of weeks, the thing smells absolutely raunchy. I've taken to using the sponge to wipe down my counters with undiluted bleach at the end of the night to kill off any critters that are living in there, then rinse it off under hot water to remove the bleach, then put it in a hanging grate so that it doesn't sit in its own liquid. This seems to extend its life to about a month or so. For the cost, it's worth having a few of these little scrubbers lying around.","summary":"Cleans but gets gross","unixReviewTime":1401840000,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

I am old enough that frosting mixes were introduced while a child, and readymade frosting was not available until I was well into my adolesence.  Thus, I learned how to whip up a cake frosting with little trouble or effort.  However, now days, even that little bit of effort is more than I have in me.  For those occassions, I rely on a can of this.  It is also good to use to make what we called quickie sandwich cookies back in my college days:  a graham cracker split in half filled with a generous dollop of this frosting.

Everything you need to know is on the back of the box. You don't have to measure anything. All it takes is 1 stick of butter, 1 egg, and a splash of vanilla extract. And you can actually go without the vanilla if you don't have any handy. With a bit of quick kitchen maneuvering (preheat the oven and get cookie sheets ready before you mix the dough), you can have the first batch of gluten free cookies in 15 minutes. That's not bad considering it will take at least 15 minutes to go pick up a box at the local store (if you have one down the street) when a craving hits and there is absolutely nothing to snack on in the house.\nThe taste is not completely homemade. Maybe it's mental, but I think all boxed stuff has a \"BOXED\" taste. But it is warm and freshly baked and you get that nice sweet aroma in the house. I don't recommend eating the cookies directly out of the oven because the GF dough needs to cool and set a bit longer than regular wheat dough. Instructions on the box indicate that a 2 minute cooling period is required. I think it's wise to follow those orders. I let mine sit a little longer.\nThe raw dough doesn't taste as good as regular cookie dough. The rice\/potato flour mix is quite grainy and the dough itself is crumbly. I would not attempt to add it to my ice cream.\nThe recipe calls for butter. You CAN substitute with margarine but butter tastes a lot better.\nI just made a box this afternoon. I followed the directions. I made 24 (3-inch) cookies and baked them for 10 minutes because I like my cookies brown and toasty with crispy edges. You don't have to brown them as much. The recipe say 8-10 minutes. I let them cool for 5 minutes then ate 3 with milk.

This cereal is good, and makes an interesting snack as well, but like a lot of processed foods, it contains more salt and sugar than what is good for us, with 180mg of Sodium (Salt) and 8g of Sugars. The Fructose and the Canola Oil don't get my votes either. I hate the taste of Canola Oil, and it makes me nauseous. Thankfully, the amount used in this product is minimal. I guess my body is trying to tell me something, -that Canola Oil is not good for me. I get the same feeling after eating anything containing synthetic sugars like aspartame and saccharin.

These are organic and have a few less ingredients.\n\nFLAVOR:\nWith three flavors of \"bunnies\" you get a medley that is kind of nice.  However, only the chocolate ones have enough flavor to even compare to a Teddy Graham.  The chocolate chip has a very, very mild chocolate flavor, but isn't too bad.  The honey flavor is pretty bland.  Honey Teddy Grahams have more flavor, so I'd choose them over plain honey bunnies.\n\nTEXTURE:\nThese bunnies get stale very fast.  Seal them up well, or you'll have bad tasting bunnies.  Fresh, they're crispy and crunchy and a great size for on-the-go snacking or sitting at your computer with a cup of coffee and these little cookies.\n\nOVERALL OPINION\nI do like the organic factor.  However, they're generally a little more money than their competing Teddies, and I like Teddy flavor better.  It's up to you and your taste buds, but I would at least recommend trying the bunnies.  I buy them when they're on sale for cheaper than Teddies.","summary":"Teddy Graham's Competition","unixReviewTime":1336348800,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

At many stores, and other locations where one might procure beans, specifically in a can, they tend to be closer to the $1 range.\nHowever, if you have the tendency to stay at home, forget things at grocery lists, want to stay lazy for a bit, but still want your can o' beans, then these beans are here for you, just as they once were there for me.\nIt is nice to see the large organic label on the front of the can, though to claim that beans are vegetarian seems a bit excessive; I would be concerned if my beans were made of meat. This may be to avoid confusion with beans that are sometimes mixed with meat in the same can, but these are usually clearly labeled, and often have so little meat that it's practically vegetarian anyway.\nRegardless, these beans served their purpose well.\nBlack beans work especially well in chili mixes (or any bean other than refried\/mashed, but I prefer the black bean), and a vast array of other concoctions. As some people mention, they weren't mush, which is good, and all the beans were thoroughly cooked. Of course, I expected both of these things; if I ate an uncooked canned bean, this would be getting a 1-star review.","summary":"Magical Fruit","unixReviewTime":1502928000,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

It's cutting bar cuts the wrap smoothly and the end of the wrap is easy to remove from the roll, doesn't get all sticky and impossible to remove like on some other brands.  Some of the comments mention that Saran Wrap does not cling, but I have never had this problem when using this wrap at room temperature, in the refrigerator, or in the microwave.\n\nKeeps food stuffs fresh and wonderful to use to separate layers of freshly baked cookies and brownies stored in containers in the freezer.  I also use this to tightly wrap partially used fruits and vegetable like apples and avocadoes.  Saran Wrap excels at keeping these partially used fruits and vegetables fresh with no browning.  Another great Amazon Prime Pantry value.","summary":"The Best Plastic Wrap for your Cooking, Baking, and Food Storage Needs","unixReviewTime":1435017600,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

Additionally, some reviews are for the smaller pop top type cans that come in a multi-pack.  I quit buying chunk light tuna several years ago because of the decline to mushy texture and stronger fishy smell.  Full disclosure, I was buying Starkist, not Chicken of the Sea, but the Starkist chunk light tuna I grew up on had evolved into a product more like cat food than I cared to eat.  My only reason for trying this brand was BECAUSE it is labeled as Solid White Albacore, the price was better than my grocery store, and I had some room in my pantry box so this product popped up as a recommendation.  Had I come to the page and looked at the reviews or the photographs, I would absolutely positively passed on buying it.  The rusty cans shown at the top of the product page are disgusting.

If you want wonderful creamy oatmeal, then use milk instead of water.  For one portion bring one cup of milk to a boil.  Add  cup of hole oats.  Return to a boil.

Along with egg whites and spinach.  I use xylitol crystals to sweeten it, but you could use anything if you are not counting macros.  lol  It goes wonderfully with a bit of butter and pure maple syrup as well! Since this is the old fashioned type of oat, it's a lot thicker and holds up well in my weekly food preps.  I also add some golden flax seed, primarily on the suggestion of my nutritionist.  I don't love the taste of flax, though.  But you do what you have to do to get the results you want, right?\n\nI can NOT think of a more economical food, that is a perfect fuel, you can eat every day and the cost is pennies a serving.  It doesn't hurt that studies show that oatmeal scrubs a bit of plaque out of the old arteries as well.  Seriously, this is the most affordable superfood that tastes great and you can build from there - berries, syrup, cream - great vehicle for other lovely stuff.","summary":"Every. Single. Morning.

As you know, it's a great source of fiber and lowers cholesterol. Most Americans don't get nearly as much fiber as they should, so incorporating oatmeal into your morning routine has health benefits. My parents, for example, are in their 60's and 70's and they eat a bowl of oatmeal every day at breakfast. For heavy users such as them, this is the most economical way to buy Quaker Oats. At the time of writing, if you use Subscribe & Save, it's less than $7! One box has 91 servings, if you make it according to the suggested portion size. That's a fantastic bargain, especially if you have a large family. A single 42 oz canister costs nearly $5 where I live. This box is 8 lbs of the stuff!\n\nWe prefer the Old Fashioned over the Minute version. You are probably very experienced with cooking oats, but in case you are not: The Old Fashioned needs to be brought to a boil on the stove and cooked for several minutes until desired tenderness, but the extra work is worth it because it has better chewiness than the quick oats. I tend to make mine less watery so I can transport it to work and eat it there. That way it stays nice and firm, and the oats will reabsorb some of the water over time and improve texture. It is better to undercook than overcook because undercooking can be fixed later in a microwave. If overcooked, there's not much you can do with the mush. I like my oatmeal cold. It shrinks the oats and gives them a better mouthfeel, but everyone has his\/her own preference.\n\nTo cut down on calories and sugar, I only use a spoon of strawberry preserve or some other kind of jam. For texture, I add chopped walnuts. (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Kirkland-Signature-Walnuts-3-Pounds\/dp\/B000XBCBW6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kirkland Signature Walnuts, 3 Pounds<\/a>&nbsp;are excellent). You can add bananas, berries, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup or any other sweetener. You can also make granola bars or oatmeal cookies with oatmeal, of course.\n\nNote: the pictured canister is not included. This is simply a very large bulk box of oatmeal. Inside are two plain 4 lb plastic bags. I recommend saving your empty canisters to put the oats in, for daily use. The rest, you can put back in the box and store until you need to refill the canister. This will make it easier to handle the oats, versus a big clumsy bag.","summary":"A fantastic value for oats eaters","unixReviewTime":1495238400,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

The open-tab opens vertically which doesn't make much sense as you get disoriented from turning it to the side and having the text in the wrong position and may spill on occasion if you are not self aware.

I liked the New York Cheddar but found them a bit sickening after a while then my interest was sparked again with their Salt and Pepper flavor and now Ive been working my way through the newer flavors. The Roasted Garlic is my current favorite.\n\nIts a good thing for me to have intensely flavored potato chips (as long as the ingredients are identifiable as real food) as Ill eat fewer of them compared to your more everyday plain potato chips. The only caveat is that if you eat too many Roasted Garlic chips late at night on an empty stomach, you may end up lying awake for hours, being chased around your bedroom by a huge garlic bulb (OK, perhaps I was dreaming). The Red Curry is also well worth trying; the Dill Pickle and Backyard BBQ were interesting at first but not outstanding for me.\n\nIm giving Kettle Foods 5\/5 green stars for social and environmental impact. They use 100% green energy (either on-site solar and wind or through credits); convert all of their waste oil to biodiesel; had the first LEED gold certified (i.e. sustainable) manufacturing plant in the U.S.; support various causes from wetland conservation to hunger relief.\n\nThe last frontier that Kettle needs to reach is sustainable packaging. Im tempted to give them only 4\/5 green stars because their packaging is non-recyclable and non-compostable. After all, Sun Chips (a subsidiary of PepsiCo, for goodness sake!) introduced a compostable bag back in 2009. The bag turned out to be hilariously loud but they improved the packaging to make it quieter in 2011. Boulder Canyon, who make really tasty chips, introduced a better compostable bag made from wood pulp. Recently, Oceans Halo began selling seaweed chips (which are interesting) in nice compostable bags, also made from wood pulp. So why cant you, Kettle? Hmm? Until you do, Im tempted to curb my cravings for fried potato by making them at home  slice, par boil for 10 min, pan fry in olive oil for 5 min, season. Hey presto!\n\nUntil Kettle come up with a compostable bag (please do this soon!) there is another option  you can recycle your chip bags by collecting a bunch and sending them to Terracycle (postage paid by them).","summary":"Intense flavors in a crunchy chip from a sustainable company (5\/5 green stars)","unixReviewTime":1440201600,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

Crunchy, flavorful, all-natural ingredients, light - they almost taste home-made. The texture and crunch of these chips are amazing. And the taste is just perfect.

Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.\n\nSome people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: \"Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag\"\n\nSome have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: \"At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and\/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are \"trans fat free\" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.\"  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.\n\nYou will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.

Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.\n\nI also recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Kettle-Chips-Honey-Dijon\/dp\/B000G6MBV4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Kettle-Chips-Spicy-Thai\/dp\/B000G6Q4GM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai<\/a>.\n\nAnnette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"","summary":"One bite and you'll become a \"chippoisseur\"","unixReviewTime":1229385600,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

It is every bit as gentle as they say it is--no burning sensation in my eyes when I use this to wash my hair. This bottle is a bit larger than other sized bottles of the shampoo which, of course, means it will last you a bit longer and that's great.

Here's what it is . . .\n\nThe box for a single serving (250 calories) is about the size of a couple of decks of cards.  Contains a small round can (about 2.5\" x 1\") of the tuna product, and a sealed foil package of a half dozen round buttery (Ritz type) crackers.  A little spreading spoon is also enclosed.  3.35 ounces in all.  No refrigeration required.  The tuna opens easily with a pull open tab.  So, what did I find inside?\n\nTo be honest, with the name, \"Cheesy Tuna Melt\", my hopes were not high.  I expected some bland tuna goo in a bland cheese sauce bath.  What I actually discovered was a totally pleasant surprise . . . . This is what I would have called a very, very good tuna salad.  Well seasoned with a pleasant tartness an identifiable morsels of tuna, celery, cheese, water chestnuts and so forth.  Very tasty.  I piled it high on each of the six crackers and still had a little left over (which I finished off using the little spoon).  This served as my lunch - I always prefer a very light lunch and this was just perfect for me.\n\nSome variations -- I ate mine at room temperature, but I think it would have been even better a bit chilled.  For my taste preferences, if it's handy I might do a shake of black pepper on it next time.\n\nI received one serving of this snack at no charge as part of a promotional program in exchange for doing an honest product review.  If I don't like it, I'm free to say so and I always do as appropriate.  But this one is a great discovery for me.  I'd buy this.  I WILL buy this.  I'll also snoop around and see if Bumble Bee is offering anything else in this line.

I am in my mid-twenties and bought these as a quick snack to include in the lunch I make for work. Usually, I actually can't stand any of the snack \"jello\" bowls but I thought I would give these a try and I love them. The peaches and the Strawberry Gel taste great together and when I say great I don't just mean like kind of good. I mean great! I am not a huge fan of food coloration. . . but honestly if they were clear I probably would be kind of \"weirded out\" so in this case I think it works. I would definitely recommend that other people try them at least once (because of how much I like them). I will definitely keep on buying them.","summary":"Super Tasty!","unixReviewTime":1463961600,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

The reason I like this brand (kashi) and flavor (oatmeal dark chocolate) of cookie is because they are not too sweet but they satisfy the need for a chocolatey\/sweet treat in a healthier way. They only have eight grams of sugar per cookie and each one has 2 grams of protein and a healthy amount of fiber. The cookies are large, so one cookie is sufficient, just take your time to enjoy it! The chocolate tastes good. You should know that they are a little dry. They aren't crunchy dry, and it's not a negative comment either, it's just a good idea to have your favorite beverage nearby to wash them down with! It is a cookie with some body to it - it's a hearty treat. Everyone I have shared these cookies with - family and coworkers - all gave them a thumbs up.","summary":"A Delicious Cookie.

These oatmeal dark chocolate bars are a delicious alternative.  They have dark chocolate chips and dark chocolate is good to have every day in small amounts.  They are only 130 calories per cookie and have 12 whole grains or 14% of your fiber.  They are low in sugar with only 8 g.  Also low in salt at 3% of your daily amount, no transfat or cholesterol. Naturally Sweetened: rolled oats and wildflower honey for a touch of natural sweetness.\n\nAs far as taste, they are grainy with oats and the bursts of dark chocolate flavor.

I often turn this side dish into a main dish by adding shrimp, canned tuna, or chicken breast and some diced vegetables (tomato, asparagus, broccoli, peas, corn), whatever is handy at the time.  It works well when you have a small serving of vegetables left over from the night before which wouldn't be enough for two people, but is too much to throw out (we are empty nesters).  It is easily changed from it's basic flavor to a more robust one by the addition of your favorite spice or herbs.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, my only criticism would be the decision to list the nutrition info based on 2.5 servings.  Seriously?  How is that helpful for anyone other than maybe a couple with one young child who would eat that half serving?  I don't understand why they don't just list it as two servings and adjust the nutrition accordingly so I don't have to do mental math.","summary":"Good Stuff But Buy Two If You Have a Family to Feed","unixReviewTime":1471392000,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}
