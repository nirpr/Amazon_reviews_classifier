The ginger flavor is weak with no zing, and seems almost watered down. Additionally, the inclusion of sucralose (Splenda) in a non-diet labeled soda is an unwelcome discovery. And, rightly or wrongly, I feel a lingering annoyance at the lack of forthrightness.\n\nStating 25% less calories on the box does not automatically indicate the use of an artificial sweetener. Seagrams shares the name with a line of liquor so I hoped the soda would simply be a little less syrupy sweet, with a flavor perhaps a bit more grown-up -- but not diet.\n\nUsually the packaging boldly states Diet or Ten or some other indication of an artificially sweetened product. It is common for people to have sensitivities to sucralose or simply wish to avoid it so what is the reasoning for mentioning its inclusion only in the ingredient listing?\n\nReading the ingredient label searching for diet ingredients in non-diet soda is not normally a part of a soft drink purchase but I guess Ill be checking from now on. So, between the diluted taste and the buried Splenda, Ill stick with Canada Dry or TJs in the future.

The flimsy cardboard packaging used for Band-Aids these days was squashed absolutely flat.\n\nI stopped laughing when I used the first Band-Aid. I don't know what the people who wrote all the glowing reviews were using, but the ones I got functioned nothing like the ones they describe.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer, these Band-Aids have a \"unique adhesive\" and \"stay in place.\" I don't think so.\n\nThey stop sticking to the skin when wet, but they stick so well to themselves that when you try to remove them, they stretch and tear rather than come off all at once (as any sane bandage does). I've ended up with many small, stretched and torn-away fragments trying to get one of these things off. Is this what's known as \"unique adhesive\"?\n\nIn between removing the bandage's wrapper and getting the thing positioned correctly, if the sticky part happens to accidentally double back on itself, you can forget about getting it loose. All it will do is stretch and tear. I have to throw these in the trash.\n\nOnce, when one of the torn-off fragments landed on my carpet -- sticky side down --  it wouldn't budge. I had to cut it from the carpet using scissors.\n\nI've always loved the Band-Aid brand, but not anymore. I'm unable to recommend this product. Even Dollar Store bandages are better (and cheaper). I'm quite disappointed in Johnson & Johnson.","summary":"Not recommended","unixReviewTime":1507334400,"vote":5.0,"image":null,"style":null}

Next day, the Maxwell House pods again brewed very slowly.  The next day, my pot would not brew at all.  Nothing would get it to brew.  Eventually (after finding coffee elsewhere) I did all the cleaning things, especially the upper needle.  I ran plain water (no pod) and got a cup loaded with very fine coffee grounds. I ran this cleaning a few times.  I used other pods for a while, and all was fine in my world.  But in the interest of science, I ran plain water after each cup - no fine grounds. So, now I tried another MH pod - and the problem instantly came back.  After the very slow brew, I ran a plain water through, and again had a cup loaded with fine grounds.  I know the coffee is probably fine, but the pods are defective, and dangerous to my pot - which has been a loyal and dependable machine until now.

Munching along, my hand turning a color reminiscent of Halloween fake blood when I made the mistake of reaching into the bag (do pour freeze dried fruit into a bowl\/onto a plate, ideally in a space you can clean any dust up as there will be dust\/seeds no matter how much care is taken to dry the fruit delicately!)... the simple process of grab, bite, smile, and swallow had steps 3+4 replaced by cringe+spit. That unforgettable taste of fruit gone bad was present in far too many berries. I blame this on poor quality control,and I blame poor QC on #2:\n\n2) Sourced from all over the place... No thanks. There are plenty of berries right here in North America where their facilities operate (where they bag them and sell them at horribly inflated prices for fruit from all over the place with cheaper than dirt cheap labor and zero oversight in the end of the crops)...\n\n3) Beyond the mold, probably again thanks to #2, the flavor varied wildly. That would be fine were this a wild-growing, foraged sort of crop... It is an agribusiness, though, and some were really tart, some bland, some fine, some bleh. Dust will happen regardless of the brand\/farm, and seeds will definitely be loose (you should definitely eat them-they are the healthiest part of strawberries!)... but there should be some sampling done to ensure they aren't selling fruit that was picked too early or late-either is unacceptable.\n\n4, well 3.5) There is a perfectly good, slightly less expensive (no fancy packaging or importing costs), very CONSISTENT alternative and it is a brand\/place I honestly almost never recommend: Trader Joe's. Yeah, that place. The place I literally only go to grab avocados and bananas and occasionally repackaged cheese I recognize or repackaged buttery thin almond sliver cookies from Belgium before my doc told me to cut gluten out because my immune system was PO'ed at the stuff... It is now a place for avocados, bananas, very occasionally their whole milk strawberry Greek yogurt (partly because they have forks and spoons in two bags at the check out-smart people!-and I am often there around 2pm and haven't yet paused for lunch but my beloved nearby family hole in the wall restaurant closes from 2-5)... Now add dried fruit to that list, specifically strawberries and sometimes mangos; maybe blue\/raspberries or even pineapple(prob not the pineapple as it hasn't been my favorite thing freeze dried-its liquid is its charm). Anyway, if you DO have access to a TJ's, a place I wouldn't pay a dime for 90% of the offerings of, well, I can honestly recommend you go, rip open a bag of theirs, see if the tartness level is okay by your standards, and depending on whether you can get there any time or it is a bit of a trek, get a few bags or enough for an apocalyptic scenario. Ah, and if you don't have a dish, have a vinyl or nitrile glove when you dive in unless you want to accidentally dust-paint anything your hand touches a rosy hue -the glove removal is easier than washing hands without touching anything between my eating spots and sink, I have found, though I usually stick to the tiny bowl method and have a couple alcohol or other hand wipes wherever I am, ready for immediate use once I am done with this messy snack choice.\n\nAh, I see people mentioning (in questions) things like smoothies... Not recommended: go for frozen or fresh if that is your goal-these are a tad powdery and entirely dry and lighter than a corn flake so their density isn't suited for rehydration in any means except perhaps w\/cereal, the brief hydration of cereal, or maybe mayyybe yogurt though I would do fresh for that or even go for jam before freeze dried since the wafer texture would to me be off putting (just my 2; do your thing, whatever it is, so long as it is not harmful to others or ideally yourself!)\n\nNatierra's folks, if you are reading this, consider local, easy to control quality-wise, produce. Berries are abundant in the US-all year, even, though summer is when they taste like berries should and cost normal amounts... My understanding is that you are like the gift wrapping department of JC Penney... Making the item's presentation more frilly isn't what we want w\/food; if you are really confident, try clear bags... Charging $2 more (yeah, yeah, I know half goes to the store, but we are talking about pretty small amounts of fruit-fruit supposedly certified organic but much like cheap-o apple juice, who knows what the conditions are when they come here from three or four countries, a few CONTINENTS, even-without so much as a silica packet in the bag to prevent the boat's varying humidity from ruining the goods... Charging a couple bucks more, MORE AT ALL in fact, for imported berries than the US-berries from TJ's is pretty elitist and unrealistic, don't you think? You get cheap crops from people making less than a dollar every two days of sunrise tp sunset labor but charge more than people paid 20x that even when NOT totally abiding by labor laws? Importing tropical fruit is, pineapple aside since Hawaii has entire areas devoted to nothing but pineapple, okay...berries? Not okay. I am not the only one who prefers my food to be from a bit closer than Africa, Poland, etc (there were a lot of oddball places I don't remember all of but berries=US; otherwise you are wrecking the environment for massive profit when you can do like the others and contract w\/US farms or at least US+Mexico if quantity is truly somehow an issue which seems false given how easily they can, w\/a written contract, replace less profitable fruit w\/berries for you as they did for TJ's)... Oh, maybe consider consistency for mangos, too... Would be nice if all of them were the FEW mm thick when dry, not one mm thick like the last couple bags I bought. Honestly, I hesitate to spend $5+ again for unpleasantly hard slivers thinner than almond slivers... The flavor is awfully hard to enjoy when crunching something harder than most ice.","summary":"Mold in about half a dozen pieces=nope, not buying these again...","unixReviewTime":1505865600,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

It is why I only rarely rate things with 1 star. Let me just put that out there before I begin.\n\nI did not buy this product anticipating restaurant quality pad thai. That being said, there were so many shortfalls that could have easily been corrected. The sauce provided is incredibly thin, and if you've made pad thai before you know that the sauce should have a consistency reminiscent of hoisin sauce or slightly thinner. This sauce had the consistency of water at best. Maybe even oily water. Then on top of that they have you add 2 tablespoons of water. Which I did, although I was skeptical but for the sake of giving the product a chance I listened.\n\nI was expecting a salty yet edible dish perhaps on the same scale as instant ramen from cup of noodles or something. The noodles come in what appears a vacuum sealed pound and retain their shape until you slightly massage them apart. They're somewhat uncomfortably slimy (for lack of a better word). They're a starchy mushy mess even after heating. The vegetables add absolutely nothing. Even if I were to fry up an egg I don't think it would have saved this. The best part about it was the small pack of peanuts that had a consistency and taste in line with what I know to be peanuts. Everything else, however failed to even slightly resemble anything that could potentially pass as Pad Thai.\n\nJust don't do it. Seriously, I'm not that picky and I won't even try again.

Then someone comes a long and dehydrates your vomit, and compresses them into chip form and packages them up to sell to you.\n\nTo me, that's how it tastes! It has a slight sour taste combined with a very strong whitecastle(And ketchup) flavor. It was so bad, that I almost threw up. My stomach kept going into convulsions and I couldn't eat anymore.\n\nTo be fair, I gave the rest of the tube to my cousin, and he seemed to love them...So, judging by that, and most of the reviews here on Amazon, I am very much in the minority I guess.

In the form of a bad stomach ache.  It's not unusual for me to get a stomach ache after eating heavily colored breakfast cereals and I should have realized this would produce the same unpleasant symptoms.  I wasn't thinking about that, I was just thinking about my previous love of Twizzlers and my desire to have a fruity snack on hand for the summer.

Since it is made from rather thin pasta, but is then rolled, it is hard to get it cooked to exactly the right degree of doneness.  You have to cook it long enough to get the rolled part cooked, but then the edges are often overcooked.

It is not pleasant though. First, the salt crystals are too large. I have used others in which the salt was similar to large sand. These are like 1\/2 carat diamonds, very difficult to use effectively, like rubbing a handful of small rocks on the skin. Worse than the grit size is the smell. I had read the ingredients before I purchased and knew there was grapefruit, but the grapefruit smell was so strong and chemical smelling it's offensive. I have to completely wash the oil away with soap when finished and still am left with an unpleasant chemical smell on my skin. I would compare it to the orange scented stuff used to remove grease from mechanics' hands, except that product doesn't burn my nose like this salt scrub.

It was a nice size for a snack.  That being said, why the 2 star was:\n\nTaste.  It was cloying to me.  Not of sweet but the over all taste of what they termed cheesecake and salted caramel.  It just wasn't good. I had the desire to rinse my mouth and brush my teeth to get rid of the taste.  I've eaten good cheesecake and bad cheesecake and this wasn't cheesecake it was like some illegitimate version of a cheesecake crossed with a cheese danish crossed with a piece of hardtack.  I felt like I had a film on my teeth and mouth when I was done eating it.\n\nTexture.  It was well... grainy and chalky.  I'm not sure how it managed both but that was the texture.\n\nIt's the first time a treat has taken me 45 minutes to eat.  And I need my head examined for doing that.  That was my stupidity.  But now I'm looking at 9 of them and wondering how in the devil I am going to pawn them off on some unsuspecting soul and if I should.\n\nI could have had an apple with 4.4 grams fiber and about 95 calories [med size] vs this for 150 calories and 5 grams of fiber.  And I hate apples.  That's telling you something if my first  thought after finishing it was \"I could have had an apple.  It would have tasted so much better.\"\n\nThat being said, you may love it and find the taste suits you.  Our tastebuds are different.  That's why we like different foods.  I'm just telling you what I found and suggesting you taste one before you buy a 10 package box.\n\n I foresee unless someone really likes them, this is going to have a LONG shelf life at my house.  Edited to add:  Hallelujah! My sister will take them [and the Brownies if it turns out I don't like them too.]  She loves them.

Some cleaning products are better than others and aerosols are right out.) The wipes are nicely wet with Lysol and they stay wet if you click the cover down carefully after use (some brands dry out quickly in the container and others arrive DOA--dry on arrival. Not good!)\n\nThe advantages:\n\n1. Sponges get dirty and spread germs around. These are use-once, toss away.\n2. You can wipe hard-to-reach spots like toilet handle, base, floor around the commode, door handles, light switches.\n3. You can keep them in a place where water is not conveniently available: your desk at work, car. You can buy these in travel packs but they are kind of pricey--only 9 per pack and prices range from two to four dollars a pack, which is a quarter to fifty cents a slam, not cheap.\n4. These make quick work of dirty sinks in the bathroom, saving time later on a really thorough cleaning.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1. Not as inexpensive as a paper towel and a spritz of cleaner.\\\n2. Non really \"disinfecting.\" Chlorine bleach solution 10pct or peroxide 3% and letting it sit disinfects more effectively than sprays or wipes.\n3. Can be harsh on your hands unless you wear gloves--you are in contact with the cleaning solution directly as you wipe.\n\nSummary:\n\nGreat for reducing bacteria on surfaces and convenient.","summary":"Convenient for cleaning--one advantage over sponges","unixReviewTime":1392163200,"vote":5.0,"image":null,"style":null}

This  \"scent\" isn't awful, but it's not very pleasant. He won't use it at all and we're back to square one. Also, the product folds out and is reminiscent of a baby wipe rather than a towelette.

I've always been a fan of St. Ives apricot scrub product but this is far different than what I remember about it. I understand that this is an acne scrub which is perfectly fine for me to use as I have an occasional breakout from from to time. Active ingredient salicylic acid is pretty much basic for major drug store style companies that make acne scrubs. I had been previously using Clearasil Daily Clear Refreshing Superfruit Scrub  which is also an acne scrub. Difference between the products is the active ingrident being less in the clearasil along with the beads used to scrub ones face. Clearsil uses micro beads which is quite effective to remove dead skin on one's face. St. Ives version, if I'm not mistaken is crushed walnut shell.  The texture is as expected from St. Ives however it feels extremely harsh on one's face. It's the equivalent of using sugar in the raw brand sugar as your exfoliant ( I have done so with a DIY scrub and found the course sugar to be very rough on the skin.) Overall, I will not be return to St. Ives as I'll be sticking to clearasil brand as it's much gentler on the skin and just as effective for dead skin removal and treatment of acne.","summary":"Far Too Harsh!!!","unixReviewTime":1452902400,"vote":null,"image":null,"style":null}

This brand also has less elastic type material than the Silhouettes which makes it harder for her to keep them up after only one or two pull downs\/ups. On a positive note, the padding in the crotch area, although a bit too short to offer excellent protection, is much thicker so protection is relatively good in the middle crotch area.

Years ago, I was able to get raw, hand pressed coconut oils from fresh coconuts from Mexico produced right here in US but due to popularity of VCOs, many producers have been creative in making money by misleading shoppers as well as many misleading reviews by shoppers certainly has hyped the business of VCO to another level. Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a lie since Extra Virgin applies only to olive oil and infact the VCO market has become so saturated that many producers are removing extra from their labeling and calling it virgin coconut oil, no more extra virgin. In Canada where the best VCOs are produced, it is illegal to even use the term, extra virgin for coconut oil but in US the laws are very relaxed. There is no Extra Virgin coconut oil, only virgin, there is no pure, no #1, no 100%, no premium liquid, or any of those terms used for coconut oils. There is no coconut oil especially produced for beauty product which is any different than for cooking or consumption either as a salad dressing or right out of the jar with a spoon. The higher the grade, the higher the nutrients, everything else are marketing tools to sell coconut oil for more money.\n\nREFINED or UNREFINED: The decision to choose between refined vs. unrefined is dependent upon the intention or use of the oil. Unrefined coconut oil has a smoke point of 280 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas, refined coconut oil's smoke point is 365 degrees Fahrenheit making it great for high heat cooking or saut&eacute;ing.\n\nGRADE A: Unfiltered, Fair Trade, Certified organic by the USDA, Canada Organic, BC Certified Organic, Ecocert, first pressed VCO and Kosher. Hand pressed and cold-pressed to produce raw oil from fresh coconuts in as little as two hours.\nGRADE B: Unfiltered, Fair Trade, Certified organic by the USDA, Kosher, cold-pressed from fresh coconuts. Unknown if first pressed, Not Ecocert, Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A.\nGRADE C: Unfiltered, Certified organic by the USDA, Kosher, cold-pressed from fresh coconuts. Unknown if first pressed, Not Fair Trade, Not Ecocert, Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A.\nGRADE D: Unfiltered, Certified organic by the USDA, Kosher, cold-pressing\/expeller pressing. Unknown if first pressed, Not Fair Trade, Not Ecocert, Not from fresh coconuts but from copra, Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A.\n\nThis is GRADE C VCO. I consume GRADE A and B with a spoon right out of the jar but for popcorn I go with GRADE C. I do not consume filtered or GRADE D. When heated, just like any food item, VCO loses its nutritional value. As a beauty product, I mix this VCO with CO since CO is one of my favorite oils for my skin and it keeps the VCO in liquid form instead of solid form regardless of the temperature.

This was my least favorite of the 4 varieties of Kind bar that Ive tried so far. Normally chocolate is a welcome addition, but in this case I think the cherry and chocolate combination is a little too sweet. Its a little bit like Ben and Jerrys Cherry Garcia, but just not as good in terms of flavors, and I don't really want to eat Cherry Garcia while hiking or as a meal replacement :) I prefer the non-chocolate Kind bars: Cranberry Almond is my fave so far  its a lot tastier and its also a little lower in sugar (27% by weight compared to about 35% for this cherry bar). I was expecting Kind bars to be great for the planet and society but thats not really the case  see below.\n\nBased on their marketing, you would think that Kind is the top choice from an ethical perspective. They donate $10,000 per month to various causes. But to put that into perspective, Kinds sales were close to $120 million in 2012 and $200 million in 2013. They donate $10,000 per month, so thats $120K per year, or 0.06% of their sales revenue for 2013 (probably about 0.02% of 2015 revenue). This is a small fraction of the amount donated by companies that have joined the 1% for the planet program. Clif have their own foundation and donate 1% of revenue (for Clif and Luna bars) to various social and environmental causes.\n\nDont get me wrong, I think that they are making an effort to do good things, but its good to put things into perspective. How about the social and environmental impact of the company itself? I could find nothing on the companys use of energy and materials, sourcing of ingredients, etc. These issues come first  corporate donations to charity (at a miniscule fraction of sales revenue in this case) should be an add-on after every effort is made in the material sourcing and manufacturing process to reduce social and environmental impact. Compare this to Clif, who have a lot to say about their use of green energy, sourcing of sustainable and organic ingredients, reduction of packaging waste, etc. Kinds lack of transparency is concerning and I feel that the goodwill they have built is entirely based on their relatively very small charitable donations  a great PR exercise but I feel that thats 90% of what it is.\n\nKind makes no statements about the ethics of their palm oil and cacao sources - does this mean that the Kind company is responsible for deforestation and child slavery? I would really like to see some information on the company and ingredients  all they have to say is that they use non-GMO ingredients. Compare to Clif, which uses 72% organic ingredients and has certified their cacao and palm oil. So, in the end Kind bars tasted better than I expected but their social and environmental impact did not meet my expectations. Hopefully they will release more data on their impact as a company but until then Id rather just eat some nuts or trail mix than buy a Kind bar. I think the choc-cherry-cashew bar deserves 3\/5 gold stars for quality and taste, and only 2\/5 green stars for social and environmental impact.","summary":"My least favorite Kind bar. Also, Kinds kindness is overrated (2\/5 green stars).","unixReviewTime":1434153600,"vote":3.0,"image":null,"style":null}

Has a nice light scent that dissipates from hair very quickly.  That said, I have naturally blonde, curly \"baby fine\" hair that has a tendency to frizz during high humidity days that we experience a lot of in our area year round.  This conditioner seems to add to the problem rather than help control it in that my hair seems to be much drier after use.  I've tried all kinds of conditioners but most that claim to help control the frizzies merely contain a wax base that does nothing other than weigh my hair down and cause it to feel a bit greasy a day or so after use  Am very disappointed since the Suave label has been around many years.  Just hadn't tried it until now and decided to do so as a result of their latest barrage of infomercials currently being aired.

I do love Smart Water Glaceau Smart Water, 33.82-Ounce (Pack of 12) for it's ultra clean taste but it is purified tap water.\n\nAs far as price goes, this seems reasonable considering they deliver it to your door.\nBut I also love my Zero Water Filter Pitcher ZeroWater ZD-023 23-Cup Water Dispenser and Filtration System and the clean water is produces from tap water.\nIt tastes even better. I can fill my plastic bottle made without hydrocarbons with\nmy Zero Water ice cubes and sip it all day, knowing that it is free of all metals and minerals. I like the little testing meter that came with Zero Water Filter Pitcher.\n\nFiji water tests at 132, Zero Water tests at 0. Which do you think is better tasting?\nTo come in at 132 for total dissolved solids makes it equal to some tap waters, without the chlorine.\nFiji tastes better to you than your tap water because most likely your tap water contains more than 200\nppm of dissolved solids.\n\nI and my family did a blind taste test of Zero Water and Fiji water. We filled cups with each of the two waters, did not label them except on the bottom, water A and water B,\nand each of the five of us tasted them without knowing which was which.\nZero Water beat Fiji for all five of us. I know this isn't scientific or representative\nof what others might find but this is our experience.\n\nWe know hydrocarbons can cause cancer.\nWe know we have a tremendous problem with plastic bottles in land dumps. I see them thrown everywhere here in Florida, in all parks and scenic natural areas.\nWe know that hydrocarbons leach out of these plastic bottles when they are in heat,\nsuch as when the un airconditioned UPS truck brings them to us. It bakes here in the Florida sun in the back of that truck, then I drink it.\n\nI do love Fiji as a bottled water. I don't love drinking hydrocarbons and have found a way to avoid them, as well as heavy metals like lead, arsenic, mercury, sodium, hydochorides, etc. that are in most bottled waters to some extent. It's great knowing I'm putting water into my body that is free of all traces of these elements. As bottled waters go this one is tops for taste.\n\nI like to keep some bottles of Fiji in my fridge along with some highly mineralized San Pellagrino San Pellegrino Limonata, 6 Pack - 11.15 Ounce Cans and some Smart Water. All of these are delicious in their own way.\nI use my Zero Water pitcher for quantities of pure water when I make tea of coffee.\n\nedit: I have read that this water is very alkaline and so I am mixing it with xylitol Health Garden Kosher Birch Xylitol 1 Lbs. Product of USA (Not From Corn)\nas a mouth rinse. The alkalinity counteracts the mouth's natural acid, which promotes decay of teeth, and the xylitol remineralizes them. Alkaline is a good thing in water and is prefered for health benefits.\n\nThe website for Fiji water states that the bottles are BPA free. It also says that the bottling plant sits on top of the water aquafer, where the water is drawn up from deep underground directly into the bottles, without any type of processing at all. The water is not polluted by twenty-first century air or touched by human hands, it is simply put into the bottles. There is lacking any type of analysis of exactly what minerals are in the water but I have found on other sites information that there are a small amount of beneficial minerals in it such as calcium and magnesium.\n\nUnfortunately, this water is not friendly to the global environment. It is estimated to take one quart of petroleum products simply to fly this from Fiji to it's final destination, for each bottle of water sold.\nThat's a huge toll on the environment. It's ridiculous actually if you stop and think about it.","summary":"Here is the deal with this water","unixReviewTime":1329523200,"vote":14.0,"image":null,"style":null}

But the pad part is good and doesn't get stuck to the wound.\nThe only downside I have found is that they don't hold up well when wet, and it is best to just change them if they get soggy.

Years ago, EVERY variety of De Cecco pasta was extruded through bronze dies.  Better quality pasta makers extrude their dough through bronze dies, which require more pressure but leave microstriations that capture the sauce when the pasta is seasoned. In other words, when pasta is extruded though bronze dies, THE SAUCE STICKS TO THE PASTA BETTER!\nDe Cecco now only makes a few varieties that are extruded though Bronze.\n\nIn Italy, pasta is graded in three quality levels. The designations for each level are the lower case letter \"i\" as in it, if etc\n (i.) Durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semola di grano duro), (ii.) Low grade durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semolato di grano duro) and (iii.) Durum wheat whole meal pasta (pasta di semola integrale di grano duro). Pastas made under this category must be made only with durum wheat semolina or durum wheat whole-meal semolina and water, with an allowance for up to 3% of soft-wheat flour as part of the durum flour.\n\nDe Cecco would be the equivalent of a (ii) grade.\n\nAmerican pastas like Ronzoni or Barilla (Yes, the Barilla pasta you buy in the United States IS made in the US and NOT in Italy. Call the up. I did}. are made from the exact same semolina AND white flour that Ronzoni is made from. In my opinion those are the two worst brands of pasta you can buy There are hundreds of good grade Pastas from Italy. Usually in cellophane bags that are at minimum a grade (ii). The higher end ones are grade (i) which is the highest grade semolina with NO flour and extruded through bronze dies so that they are porous to HOLD the sauce.  Any time you see the word \"FLOUR\" in the ingredients, skip it. Even the WORST pastas in Italy only allow 3% flour.\nOne of my favorite pastas is from Cucina Antica. That pasta is POROUS, made from the best quality Italian Semolina. You can SMELL the semolina when you serve it and it will HUG THE SAUCE. Another great pasts is Divella. But be certain to choose pasta's from their bronze extruded line of  pastas.\nSo, as far as grocery store pasta, De Cecco is still one of the best. I'm just dissatisfied that they are now doing away with the Bronze extrusion process.\nYou can get the same quality as De Cecco at a lower price by buying brands like Anna or any other brand that is made in Italy and ONLY contains Durham Semolina. Once you see things like Durham FLOUR or Semolina FLOUR, skip it. It will never cook to firm consistency. It goes from too hard to too soft. Nothing in between. If you want to go HIGH end, get Cucina Antica. It's the same as the pastas that go for over ten bucks per pound.","summary":"GOOD! but not the best","unixReviewTime":1405555200,"vote":7.0,"image":null,"style":null}

Not the best by any means, but pretty darn good.\n\nIn Italy pasta is graded with the letter \"i\" (lower case).\nIn the US, they can call almost ANYTHING Pasta. Major Brands like Ronzoni and Barilla (yes, Barilla sold in this county is MADE in this country with the same ingredients as Ronzoni) are usually half flour.\n\nIn Italy, even the WORST grade of Pasta is only allowed to have 3% or less flour.\nReal Pasts is 100% Durham Semolina and NO flour.\n\nThe Italian ratings for Pasta are as follows:\n\n Dried pasta with three subcategories \n\n(i.) Durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semola di grano duro),\n\n (ii.) Low grade durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semolato di grano duro) and\n\n(iii.) Durum wheat whole meal pasta (pasta di semola integrale di grano duro). Pastas made under this category must be made only with durum wheat semolina or durum wheat whole-meal semolina and water, with an allowance for up to 3% of soft-wheat flour as part of the durum flour. Dried pastas made under this category must be labeled according to the subcategory.\n\nSo, first make sure your pasta is 100% Durham Semolina. De Cecco is.\n\nYears ago, De Cecco used Bronze dies to extrude their pastas. that gives them a rougher texture to grab onto the sauce (gravy). They only do that now with a few of their varieties now. That's too bad.\n\nIf you want a real pasta that is made from the finest Durham Semolina AND that rough texture because of the dies used to make it, try Cucina Antica. Nice rough surface to hold the sauce and a very high grade of Semolina that you can smell the aroma of when cooking and serving. There are many other high end pastas that have that great semolina taste and aroma and rough surface to hold onto the sauce, but they can cost about ten bucks per pound.\n\nLike I said, De Cecco is a good brand of everyday pasta, but you can also get may other brands from Italy that are about equal to De Cecco (like Anna, Farrara and a bunch of others) for less money. Just check that they are from Italy and are 100% Durham Semolina and NO flour.","summary":"ONE OF THE BEST BRANDS","unixReviewTime":1392595200,"vote":52.0,"image":null,"style":null}

Also, oats are a nice change from corn all the time. This cereal has enough crunch for me to get excited about.  (Sometimes I am in the mood for more assertive eating, in which case casually swallowing pudding or yogurt will not do.)  Also, I am fond of the Quaker.  We've been together a long time.

There are certainly more peanuts in each bowl we pour out-about 65%-70%.\n\nFortunately, peanuts are extremely healthy and a good source of protein. But, the price should be adjusted downward for this high percentage of peanuts.\n\nAnd what 's so great about sea salt?  Was wondering about that- is it really better?  Enclosed in the Mayo Clinic's review and you can decide. It seems that  may just be a marketing ploy, too.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nWHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEA SALT AND TABLE SALT?\n\nAnswers from Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.\n\nThe most notable differences between sea salt and table salt are in their taste, texture and processing.\n\nSea salt is produced through evaporation of ocean water or water from saltwater lakes, usually with little processing. Depending on the water source, this leaves behind certain trace minerals and elements. The minerals add flavor and color to sea salt, which also comes in a variety of coarseness levels.\n\nTable salt is typically mined from underground salt deposits. Table salt is more heavily processed to eliminate minerals and usually contains an additive to prevent clumping. Most table salt also has added iodine, an essential nutrient that helps maintain a healthy thyroid.\n\nSea salt and table salt have the same basic nutritional value, despite the fact that sea salt is often promoted as being healthier. Sea salt and table salt contain comparable amounts of sodium by weight.\n\nWhichever type of salt you enjoy, do so in moderation. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium to less than 2,300 milligrams a day  or 1,500 milligrams if you're age 51 or older, or if you are black, or if you have high blood pressure, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.","summary":"ACTUALLY ABOUT 65% TO 70% PEANUTS AND WHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEA SALT AND TABLE SALT?","unixReviewTime":1452643200,"vote":5.0,"image":null,"style":null}

It is made by, and distributed by, Kellogg's Sales Company. And now on to the cereal itself. It consists of flakes of combined wheat, rice, and oats. It is crunchy and chewy, and stands up to milk quite well without becoming soggy. It has 100% PDV on many vitamins and minerals, but only a minimal or none PDV for Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium, and Vitamin D, so it is not a substitute for a daily vitamin pill with minerals. The sugar content is very high at 14g per serving, about twice what most other cereals contain, and the salt content is above average at 210mg per serving. The plusses are taste, vitamin content, and texture. The minuses are too much sugar and salt. Processed foods in general contain far too much sugar and salt. Sugar is addictive, and it leads unsuspecting children into developing hyperactivity, rotten teeth, and Diabetes. The excessive amount of salt contributes to developing high blood pressure.

Most of the time I end up using scissors to avoid shredding this wrap on the terrible cutter.","summary":"Great wrap, horrible cutting blade","unixReviewTime":1471651200,"vote":6.0,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71uph5nFqUL._SY88.jpg"],"style":null}

I am not thrilled about making plastic trash, but at least they are recyclable  They are absolutely perfect to put in a lunch box, and it is so important to increase the amount of fruits and vegetables my kids eat. They really like them and I know they eat them at school because they ask for them when they are at home too. Especially around 4'30 when dinner is not until 6;00. They are only 90 calories and have 1gm of fiber. This is one snack I am happy to give them, especially since they are packed in fruit juice.

The sweet and robust tomato soup is hearty with pasta and diced tomatoes and a touch of kale.  Add on top of that an Italian sausatge that has a slight bite.  Just enough spice to set off the sweet tomato base.  Good enough to be in an expensive Italian restaurant without the price tag and the need to dress up.  Plus, you can eat it as is, or top with a touch of mozzarella or Parmesan cheeses.  Sometimes I put both.  I am such a daredevil!  Seriously though, this is perfect for a cold night when you want a soup to stay with you, and not leave you hungry in a couple of hours.  The pasta and protein in the soup make sure of that!  It is so good that my local grocery store cannot keep it in stock.

I'm a fan of clam chowder and probably enjoy a can at least once a week.  I like the Progresson traditional version of this product as well.  There are several recipes out there using clam chowder as a main ingredient and in my review of Campbell's clam chowder I included their recipe for spaghetti clam chowder - so easy.\n\nI didn't think I was an artichoke fan until a friend ordered artichoke and ham on a pizza.  Seriously, I know that sounds horrible and it's something I never would have ordered myself.  But when I tried it I really liked it.  So if you're feeling sporty consider trying our this Progresso recipe for Clam Chowder with Artichokes.  It's really quick and easy. Two steps and 15 minutes is all that it takes.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 can (14 oz) Progresso artichoke hearts\n1 jar (4.5 oz) Green Giant sliced mushrooms\n2 cans (18.5 oz each) Progresso Traditional New England clam chowder\n1\/2 cup chopped red bell pepper\n1\/2 cup water\n  Dash salt\n  Dash pepper\n\nDirections\n\n1.  Drain and quarter artichokes. Drain mushrooms.\n2.  In 3-quart saucepan, mix all ingredients except salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thoroughly heated. Stir in salt and pepper to taste.\n\nBam!  That's it.  Very easy and I think it kicks this up a notch.  You can even get away with telling your friends its home made.  :-)","summary":"Clam Chowder with Artichokes","unixReviewTime":1426982400,"vote":2.0,"image":null,"style":null}
