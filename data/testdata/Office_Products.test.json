After verifying the purchase history, and confirmation that a replacement unit was on its way - about 18 days later we wondered where the replacement was and after asking where it was, were told the warehouse was out of stock.  When the stapler did ship, we received a completely different unit - the response was:  \"Your 7048201 is discontinued, the 48200 took its place.  You received the correct stapler.\"  So, this stapler doesn't  work for us because we mounted it on a wall in the warehouse and the new stapler has no method for mounting it on a surface that isn't flat and horizontal.  So, if you like this stapler, you better purchase now because it, according to Kathy over at Swingline, will (or is) no longer be sold  We purchased a new \"discontinued\" unit instead.","summary":"was highly Recommended - Until I needed Warranty","unixReviewTime":1384560000,"vote":null,"image":null}

The board itself seems OK, but the materials are not up to standard and the installation is overly complex.  After attaching clips to hold the upper portion of the whiteboard you have to install another set of sliding L brackets to the wall.  Then you put the whiteboard on the upper clips, slide the lower L bracket up to the bottom of the board, then you have to install two small screws into the metal edge of the whiteboard.  This edge is about one forth of an inch.  How do you install a screw that close to a wall?  My screwdriver would not go into the screw without putting it at an angle.\n\nThen the head snapped off the screw.  I have attached a photograph of the failed screw.  It is extremely close to the wall and I was unable to get it out without taking the whiteboard down and chucking the screw into a drill and running it backward.  It took four tries but I got it out.  Now I have a damaged whiteboard and a wall that is torn up as well.  After 30 minutes of work with screwdrivers, punches, pliers, and drills the board was still not up.  I tried again with self tapping sheet metal screws and managed to get the bottom brackets attached to the whiteboard.  Nonetheless, it still rattles when I use it.  The supplied brackets cannot get the whiteboard attached tightly to the wall because the bottom brackets have to be loose to slide and the top clips are loose as well.\n\nThe board itself works OK, about as well as the one I replaced after 5 years of use which was another brand.  It is coated melamine and nearly any board will work as well as another.  The tray is better than most.  It is all aluminum and attached firmly to the board - unlike the board to the wall.  The edges of this board are soft aluminum and should hold up.  If the mounting system was not so worthless I would have given it three stars, but the mounting system is terrible and that system is key to the use of the board.  What good is a board that, after you put it up, is loose and manages to harm the wall surface below the board.  I will now have to putty and paint the area below the board.  The screws supplied with the board are substandard.\n\nI am also worried that the board will not stay mounted.  As it rattles a bit during use I think it will fail after awhile and I will either have to remount it somehow or buy another one.  If I do buy another board I am going to pay close attention to the mounting system - which I never dreamed could be this bad.\n\nAD2","summary":"Worthless","unixReviewTime":1458086400,"vote":"2","image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61Ku9HJBX2L._SY88.jpg"]}

First thing I noticed was that the part that holds the staples absolutely would NOT push all the way back in.  So I thought, well maybe it's supposed to hang out a little like that.  So I plugged it in to give it a try.  The light came on (and I'm still wondering what in the heck the light is needed for?) and I tried my first sheet of paper.  It went through the stapling sound but no staple appeared.  That's when I pulled the staple holder all the way out and realized it comes with lots of staples in the storage area but none placed in the row for actual stapling.  Unhindered, I simply filled that row with staples, closed it back up (only partway, remember - it still wouldn't close all the way) and tried again.  Only this time the light would NOT come back on.  Since the stapling \"sound\" didn't happen either, I can only assume the light is there, if for no other reason, then to tell you that the stapler is indeed on.\n\nSince that initial try, the light has never turned on again.  Nor has the staple storage thing ever been able to recess all the way back in like I now know it SHOULD based on all the photos I looked up.\n\nThis is an absolutely horrible stapler.  I thought for sure I had gotten a \"lemon,\" but based on the number of 1-star reviews here, I can see that's not the case.  It's just a very poorly made stapler.  Which truly surprises me since let's face it, when you hear the name \"Bostitch,\" the FIRST thing that comes to most peoples' minds is staples, is it not?  So wouldn't you think these people would be putting out top of the line staplers??!\n\nVery disappointed in Bostitch and in the lack of quality in this stapler.

Now, if you whack the top of it before you insert the papers to be stapled, it will work fine.  Once.  If you have more than one set of papers to staple, you must whack it each time.  This defeats the purpose of having an electric stapler, if you ask me.

Even though the stapler does work, loading it with new staples is somewhat difficult, and a task that my wife requires me to handle because she said that it is too much of a hassle for her to do.\n\nAs another reviewer stated, it is very hard to get fully open so as to get the new staples loaded. It seems that the mechanism for opening and closing it was not quiet engineered or assembled properly.\n\nThat does not inspire too much confidence as to what the longevity of the item will be.

It's how they are. Don't assume they're counterfeits- I think that's just brand mythology, at least in real retail outlets in the US. However, if you are willing to give them another go at less than full cost, call Mont Blanc and they should be able to arrange something. If not, take them back to the store from which you got them.\n\nI'm a fountain pen guy, but everyone has to journey back to the dark side once and a while while filling out a form. For a long time, I'd just kept a Parker Jotter w\/ a Parker Gel refill in my bag just in case, and it was serviceable, though it did suffer  from running out very quickly as well as random dry outs that no amount of spit or hot water could bring it out of. That said, it worked- though you did end up wasting a bit of cash on the Parker brand. They make nice fountain pens, and made nicer ones in their hayday, but their Gel pens... meh. So, out looking for a new rollerball or gelpen to be my just-in-case pen I was convinced by a friend to try out a Mont Blanc. We went to a local pen shop and I tried out some of the higher end FPs- I'd only used some of the sub-$500 MB FPs; and in their world, that's cheap- as well as their ball pens. My friend spoke well of the MB rollerball refills- and the clerk, not surprisingly, raved about them. Neither actually used them, so I suspect a rather simple minded attachment to brand or image.\n\nMuch to the chagrin of the clerk, I decided to play it safe and just buy a pack of the MB refills, using some hackish engineering to shoe-horn the refill into a very secure screw-top Esterbrook that was quite nibless. At first, I was pretty pleased with myself- not only did I have what was supposed to be the finest writing refill on the planet (according to the clerk and MB), I managed to make it happen in a much classier pen than any modern MB could aspire to be.\n\nIn the end, the rollerball fared much worse than the medium-quality Parker Gel refills did. I don't know how often they run out- I never managed to get past 3 days before it dried out. The first one lasted two days, and in the second one I borrowed a friend's Starwalker Fineliner and had it go three days. To round out the experience, the refills suffered from chronic skipping that wasn't helped by all of the random suggestions I got.\n\nI'd read a bunch about \"counterfeit\" refills, and in the interest of science got a MB rep's phone number from the pen shop- they sent out a new pack of 2 refills for a small fee, which is pretty lame but understandable. With these, I managed only 3 days again, with each refill being split into being used in the Estie and the MB to see if there was a difference.\n\nIn the end, MB makes a lot of over-priced plastic doo-hickeys. I'm sure it's a good way to buy some cred around the country club, but as far as writing utensils go they're pretty third tier. I didn't expect much from a rollerball refill in general, but for refills that cost $5 each I expected something quite a bit better than the Parker or generics I usually use. In fact, I got worse.\n\nFor the $12.50 I spent on the original refills and the S\/H fee I paid later, I could've just bought a bottle of Noodler's Ink, or better yet, bought one of those fountain pen ink refillable rollerball pens and skipped over re-learning the lesson that \"Mont Blanc is nothing but jewelry for dandies, not serious pens for people who write.\" Live and learn!","summary":"Low end refill- the perfect picture of a rip-off!","unixReviewTime":1216598400,"vote":"38","image":null}

Monday AM (yesterday):  I post feedback at Databazar & ALSO order next day HP 11 Yellow ink from Amazon \/ Amazon Prime (Not databazaar this time)  DataBazaar calls- Says will rush me fresh ink, Will send me a label to ship back their $11 cartridge, Want me to remove my feedback.  They offer to call back tomorrow.  I say \"Please do not call.  I've spent far too much time on this ink cartridge.  Just get me working INK asap. That's all I ask.\"\n5. Tuesday PM:  My Amazon prime ink is HERE! (thanks amazon prime\/UPS!)  Data Bazaar calls again: \"Good news, your replacement ink will be shipping out this evening and get here in 2-3 days.\"\n6. Thursday: I get 2! replacement yellows from databazaar. UPS & USPS.  They promised they would be very fresh.  They both are without the proper dated HP cardboard.  So even though it may ruin them, I open the sealed metal colored pouch to find they are BOTH 3 years past expiration also.  2008.  Very bad practice.\n\n(So Amazon Prime took my new order & DELIVERED to my door, faster than DataBazaar can get a rush order out the door to solve a problem they caused.)\n\nThe details:\nThis is a yellow hp 11 print cartridge I ordered when my HP printer warned me I'd need ink soon (turned out to be 40 days later).  This item was received from Data Bazaar WITHOUT the HP DATED cardboard package. (Suspicious?) Just a metallic coated plastic cover, sealed, WITHOUT an expiration date.  Then after 40 days or so my printer demanded new yellow ink: the warning light changed from \"caution- low yellow\" to \"Yellow empty- HP 1200D will not print without a new yellow cartridge\".  So I open the aluminum wrapper, to find ink freshly received from DataBazaar that expired in early 2008- over 3 years past expiration. ??\n\nSo during an important project, I was stranded without being able to use my main high volume printer.  The old ink from DataBazaar had either dried up, or the HP printer will not allow operation with ink this old.  Removing & replacing the cartridge with old or new does not fool or reset the HP printer.  The new cartridge is heavy- but I hear no liquid when I shake it.\n\nTo me, this has been a very bad experience.","summary":"DATA BAZAAR!

When I began using the labels, however, they functioned, and this is an understatement, like the temporary and\/or removable labels sold. None of the labels stuck permanently, I am having to consistently press the labels back down to adhere to the file folder and have had to replace over 50 labels already as they were caught on other file folders and torn off. I was over the moon about the performance of the Office Depot brand labels and the Staples brand labels as I have had absolutely no problems.

This one says \"Wood Adjustable...\" and the picture is not at all clear about the shelves, but, that's where the trouble begins.  Unlike my other Safco sorters, these shelves are and look like, cheap thick cardboard that is ill-sized.  They do NOT sit permanently or even safely on their metal pegs the way they have in the past.  If your hand simply brushes up against one of the shelves, the whole thing loses its hold on the back pegs and falls down.  Also, one of the things that I recall is that in the past the shelves were sturdier and had a paper covered surface that looked like the grain of the rest of the organizer.  Secondly, this is not wood, but wood composite, and hitting the dowels into their holes made them chip out through the bottom of the cabinet, leaving a bunch of pieces of wood chips on the floor.  This is not as good as the Safco products were formerly made.  I haven't put it into place yet, but I'm frankly worried about it carrying the weight of the things I shall place on the organizer - the same things I put on the previous one, but fewer of them.  Maybe it will perform well, but I'm just not as happy with this Safco product as I have been with past products from the same company.  Disappointed.  I wouldn't say to not buy this, but do be aware that you're NOT getting a wood cabinet, but a wood particle product. ;-(  Well, now I have had this piece of junk in place for months, and all I can think of doing is getting rid of it, which I AM going to do.  I've already purchased a replacement from another company whose products I know better, and I can't wait until I throw this pile of &*() out.  Everything I've ever put into it ends up on the shelf below it or on the floor because of the incredible instability of the shelf \"system\".  Do NOT buy this.  It isn't worth the money, and you can't glue cardboard shelves to metal pegs unless you want to have sticky epoxy glue dripping down - even the 5-minute epoxy glue.

They should be ashamed. Next, the cardboard back has no guides to attempt to nail it to the back of the shelves, meaning it is a hit or miss. A simple \"line\" on the back would have resolved that. The instructions are horrible. The whole item is atrocious, and not worth a third of the price.

Any truth to this report on Amazon?\nThanks,\n\nAmazon Customer Post\nI purchased the PS20DL for $103.00 in December of 2004. I used it for weighing gift packages to determine postage that I then ship to family and friends for birthday's and other holidays. It was never used for commercial purposes. For 18 months, I was very pleased with the scale.\n\nIn July, 2006, just 18 months from the date of purchase, the unit failed. About 3 minutes after turning it on, the LCD display goes blank, then shows strange characters and a loud, high pitched whistle can be heard coming from the base of the unit. I'm unable to weigh anything and the only way to turn it off is to remove the battery. I tried a new battery, and it still fails.\n\nI contacted Pelouze customer support and Heidi Brannigan, of Pelouze Office Products, told me \"This unit will need to be repaired. The warranty is one year from original date of purchase. We do not repair these units out of warranty.\" Since the unit is out of warranty, I asked Heidi if she at least knew what the problem was and if she could recommend a repair facility. Here's her response: \"I am not sure what exactly is wrong with the unit. As I stated we do not repair this unit out of warranty nor do we know of any outside repair facilities.\"\n\nI'm not happy that this scale only lasted 18 months, and that Pelouze offers no means of repair or support after 1 year. To them, $103 is disposable. To me, $103 is a lot of money.\n\nPelouze Customer Support Response to my question\nResponse (Tech Temp 1)  05\/09\/2008 09:59 AM EDT\nDear\nUnfortunately the warranty is only 1 year from the date of purchase but most scales last much longer then 18 months. With all the recent changes in postal regulations I would suggest the Pelouze 10 lb. USB scale instead of the PS20DL. It comes with free software you can run from your computer giving you more rating options.\nTech Temp1\nPelouze Office Products\n\nCustomer  05\/09\/2008 12:16 PM EDT\nI appreciate the suggestion on a different scale, but the point of my question was missed.\nThe question was and is - after the warranty expires, will Pelouze repair, at the customers expense, a scale that is sent for repairs? The writer of the review that I sent with my original question indicated that Pelouze refused to repair the out of warrenty scale even though she was willing to pay for the repair. Pelouze also refused to tell her where she could take the scale to be repaired by someone else.  I find that lack of customer concern - well, concerning.\n\nResponse (Tech Temp 1)  05\/09\/2008 12:41 PM EDT\nDear\nUnfortunately we don't have a repair center at all. We will replace a scale if under warranty but after that we do not replace or fix scales. You can find a local place that repairs scales in general but as I previously stated I apologies if that is an inconvenience but that's the policy.\nTech Temp1\nPelouze Office Products\n\nCustomer  05\/09\/2008 01:36 PM EDT\nYour response verifies that Pelouze has to have one of the worst customer support policies I have ever encountered. Your company not only does not have repair capabilities, but you have not bothered to provide a system of repair stations for folks to go to after their warranty expires.\nNot your fault as a tech. support rep. but an obvious 'I don't give a damn about customers' on the part of management.\nI will purchase another brand.

Nowhere does this get more excessive and infuriating than with ink cartridges. I would not be surprised to learn that in Sharp's case, both the quality and the quantity of the ink are engineered to wring minimum performance out of the cartridges. Ka-ching! That's another $30, and another, and another.\n\nAs others have noted, Sharp's pricey-as-gold cartridges have a nasty habit of drying out in record time. The printhead on the cartridges is so prone to clogging as to constitute willful negligence (or worse) on the manufacturer's part. Soaking the printhead in warm water and slamming it onto a wet rag a couple of times may dislodge the ink clots, but the relief is likely to be just temporary. I'm done with Sharp.

I've never had equipment so tempermental.\n\n- Ink low messages.  Come on HP, it is obvious the cartidges are wired to start signalling low ink after about 30-50% use.  It's ridiculous and a nuisance.  When then low ink starts coming on, you  have to press enter to keep going.  Many times I have started a print job, left my desk expecting to come back to a finished document only to find it never started because a low ink message interrupted the job and I have to press enter to continue.  There is no point to the low ink messages at all.  You just have to print to depletion.\n\nOther dissatisfaction:\n\n- Noisy and shakes a lot.\n\n- Never been able to get a decent document scan.  I don't know if it is the machine or the software.\n\n- Does not collate print jobs.  That was a shock.  It seems from the instruction manual that some models may have the function, mine doesn't.

I began searching the Internet and low and behold I am not alone. Apparently a law firm in New Jersey has already filed a class action law suit against Panasonic for the entire KX-TG and KX-TC cordless phone lines. Search \"panasonic cordless phone class action\" on google. It will be the first hit. As an attorney myself (not in any way affiliated with or even previously aware of the firm that has filed the suit), I can tell you it takes a lot of consumer complaints before a law firm decides to invest its resources in a class action suit as they are very expensive and time consuming.\n\nSo, I've learned my lesson the hard way (although there wasn't anything I could've done differently at the time of purchase). Hopefully, my experience and research into this can prevent you from having to deal with it in the future. Panasonic was unjustly enriched in distributing such a defective product and not having the corporate decency to at least recall it and replace it with a functioning line or refunding our hard earned dollars. Very disappointing and I certainly will not be purchasing the Panasonic brand again.","summary":"KX-TG and KX-TC lines are defective!  Read on...","unixReviewTime":1132185600,"vote":"8","image":null}

Not a single person in my 10-person group likes it, because of sluggish performance, frequent need to soft-reset, and tons of problems syncing with Outlook 2000 and XP under Windows XP and 2000.\nAnyway, what's really ticking me off right now is a mysterious, random hard-reset problem.  It started around Thanksgiving, when one day I was on the subway and needed to check the address of my client, so I whipped out the 1945 and to my great horror, it performed a hard reset on its own, giving me the middle-finger salute with the ugly HP welcome screen that you only see after a hard reset.  I had just recharged the battery, and the unit wasn't even 3 months old, so I was totally horrified.\nThat was just the beginning of my problems.  Ever since then the unit would turn itself off without warning, and occasionally (to be fair, not all the time) it would just hard-reset on its own.  I don't think this kind of behavior is acceptable at all in a PDA.  You buy a PDA to store information and retrieve it whenever you need it, not to stare at a blank screen at your most critical moment.\nOther people in my group also have various problems with the 1945, from broke backlight on one unit to frequent syncing problems on another to inaccurate digitizer on yet another.  BTW I've always had syncing problems with IPAQs in the past, and still do these days: when I hook up my iPaq to my Win XP machine, it would take almost 5 minutes for the sync to start.  Every day, using the iPaq 1945 is a very frustrating experience, and sluggish performance (even in Calendar and Contacts) is only the least of it.\nStay away from these poor products.  It's your money and you deserve better.

I love the improved photo quality and quietness of the printer, but I did run into the issues below...\nAs for things folks should watch out for:\n1 - The Automatic Paper Feeder (APF) wasn't assembled correctly on my unit and I've been waiting 3 months for HP to send replacement parts (4 calls to TS so far).  So for now I can only manually scan ;(\n2 - The memory slot reader is nice, but it seems to have problems with large SD\/MMC cards (64mb & 128mb).  The transfer speed slows to a crawl so I end up using a USB card reader instead.\n3 - Printer cartridges ink level can be checked online, but it will keep printing a large spool file even if it should stop.  I ran out of color ink and wanted to switch to printing in greyscale mode (black ink only) and it wouldn't let me.  You have to have enough of both inks to start new jobs.\n4 - Don't stockpile ink cartridges.  HP has some kind of expiration date that the printer won't honor after their expiration date.  The cartridges that came with the printer are good for slighlty more than 1 year.  You can check your expiration dates on the status page.  I think they do this to prevent folks from refilling or buying re-manufactured cartridges.\n5 - Adobe Acrobat 6's \"Scan to PDF\" feature doesn't seem to work with this printer.  My guess is that since both products are new they weren't tested together.  I hope Adobe & HP can work together to get full Acrobat support for the 7130 in a future update from either company.\nHaven't used the fax feature so I can't comment.","summary":"Mixed bag","unixReviewTime":1061337600,"vote":"18","image":null}

We bought them because we knew we would get a sturdy product that would at least last an entire school year.  I am not sure if Avery is now using a different manufacturer, but the quality of these \"heavy duty\" 1.5 inch binders is not very good.  The binders came shipped in a cardboard box, each one laid in a different direction, none sealed, no padding in the shipping box.  The binders came with dents in the corners where the binders fold, one had a ripped corner, and the sturdiness factor wasn't quite there. All had a crinkled look on the spine as if to suggest that the glue that holds the plastic onto the paperboard had lifted and was permanently wrinkled. While the ease of opening the rings with the top and bottom tabs is simple and easy to do, the less than stellar construction takes away from the overall quality of the product.\n\nAs a side note, my daughter is using the 2 inch Avery binder for elementary school this year. One month in to using the binder, it is already separating at the seams, and she will be lucky to make it to Christmas break before it completely falls apart.  Whatever Avery needs to do to get back to being thought of as a manufacturer of quality products, they need to change quickly.  I am not willing to pay a premium for the Avery name if the quality isn't better than the generic ones I can buy at Walmart for far less money.  At $8.95 per binder, there is no way I would ever justify the cost.

Had the opportunity to prep it.  The bright color screen is beautiful, and using the built-in camera can't get any easier.  The screen feels a little slippery, and Graffiti 2, which still requires you to memorize some weird shorthands, takes some getting used to for people new to Graffiti and also old-time Palm users.\nOverall I'm still impressed with Palm's simplicity and speed.  And I appreciate the ability to sync with Outlook, using an included third-party app.\nBut I'm very disappointed in the way Palm implements multimedia functions.  In this area, the Pocket PC is way simpler.  Let me expound.\nTo play audio files (only MP3 and RealAudio are supported), you MUST purchase a secure digital expansion card.  Of course, given the Zire 71 only has 13MB of user memory, you wouldn't fit too many MP3 songs in the internal RAM anyway if you could.  But, still, it would have been nice to be able to carry two favorite songs with me without the SD memory.  And had Palm chosen to license Microsoft's WMA technology, we could get the same sound quality at half the file size as standard MP3.\nSo you need to purchase an SD card, and then install RealOne Player from the 2nd companion CD.  The choice of RealOne is not a blessing, because Real's software is totally invasive, even more so than Microsoft's.  And copying MP3 files from your Windows desktop to the Zire is a total pain: first you have to create a playlist in RealOne, then specify which files in RealOne to copy, and finally copy.  With Pocket PC, I just use Windows Explorer to go to the My Music directory on the Pocket PC, and then drag-and-drop MP3 and WMA files.  (On the Mac, you'd use Hotsync, which makes it easier than on Windows.  It puzzles me why Palm chose not to implement the same technique on Windows.)\nTo play video files, you'd need to install both the Kinoma Player and Quick Time.  Then, each time you want to copy a file to the Zire, you must use Kinoma to convert the source file (AVI, MPEG and MOV are supported), a time-consuming process.  This is true on both Windows and Mac.  If you have a fast P4 the process is not as painful, but still it's totally unnecessary.  Again, on the PPC, I just drop-and-drop video files into the My Documents folder (or a subfolder) and voila.\nSo if you are buying the Zire 71 for multimedia functionalities, hold off your purchase and wait until Palm improves this area.  If you are buying it for snapping pictures, go for it.","summary":"Sorely disappointed in multimedia functions","unixReviewTime":1059523200,"vote":"164","image":null}

It's caller ID-ready, has good noise reduction and has a speed dial function and mute button. In addition, Plantronics has one of the best warranties I've ever experienced. I simply called when my first phone stopped working and they sent a new one within a couple of days, no hassle, no paperwork. So why only two stars?\n\nFirst, the belt clip is inadequate (especially for those of us who never wear belts.) The clip is too weak to clip to jeans, so I always have to wear a shirt with a pocket in order to have a place to put the phone. This is a serious flaw, as I discovered the clip's weakness only after the phone fell off my pants and onto the floor the first few times I tried it.\n\nSecond, the number pad is frustratingly small. It is easy to misdial with keys the size of a pencil eraser.\n\nThird, and most important, the unit's phone jack seems to have a design flaw. I am on my second phone within one year and each one has, over several months, started crackling and cutting out. At first I thought it was the headset, since holding the cord a certain way would eliminate the crackling sound. On a hunch, I bought a new headset from another manufacturer, plugged it in, and immediately started getting the crackling noise. Now that my warranty has expired, I will not be buying a replacement phone, but looking for a new manufacturer altogether.

I use the 12C gold more often than the 12cP.\n\nMy biggest disappointment with the 12cP is its relatively slow processing SPEED vis-a-vis the predecessor 12C and its competition (the HP10B, TIBA2plus).\n\nThe 12cP is notably slower than the 12C especially when performing Time Value of Money (TVM) calculations.\n\nRunning both HP12s side-by-side with the same data input, my 12cP has been consistently slower by 50% as compared to my 12C.\n\nIf possible, I would suggest that potential users and buyers try this data set on both the 12C and 12cP before buying. Clear register. Find [i] after input [PMT]=-1458;[FV]=0,[n]=84,[PV]=103600. The HP12C would take 20 seconds \"running\" while the HP12cP would take about 30 seconds to give the same answer [i]=0.4059!\n\nThis apparent lack of speed is difficult to accept for a supposedly latest financial calculator upgrade from any manufacturer! It is a bad joke, considering that my 12 years old HP10B could perform the same TVM calculation in just 2 to 3 seconds!\n\nHowever,both HP12Cs are great value for money if the user consider the TOTAL solutions and free website support and training which is available from HP. In addition, there are lots of literature and solutions written by third party users over the still ongoing 20+ years production run of the 12C. IMHO,in addition to excellent user support, the PROGRAMMING capability of the HP12c is the other major face saving advantage which put both the 12Cs over its TI challengers for now.\n\nThe good people @ HP may like to know that 96% of my fellow students are now using their competitor's Texas Instrument TI-BAIIplus! The BAII-plus is chosen for its 50% lower price and much faster processing speed. The relative slower speed of the HP12c\/12cP does not pull the crowds from TI, especially when speed is much needed during stressful exams condition. A slower processing speed would also cancels off the advantage of learning RPN.\n\nAfter using the misnomer of a sucessor HP12cP, I personally feel that the 12C is still very much the industry standard. However, it would be better if HP would consider incorporating some useful improvements like a [BACKSPACE] key if it is technically feasible. Also, seasoned 12C users of the RPN would not miss the ALG mode on the 12cP especially when it HP doesn't have ( ) included. The HP12cP is an odd ball ALG calculator from this viewpoint. A suggestion to the dear good people at HP, please let future HP12C GOLD upgrades remain as an exclusively RPN machine.\n\nI would also be very glad if somebody from HP could highlight to me on which are the 10+ more (130+ total)improved functions on the 12cP as compared to the 12C (120+ functions) to help me justify the additional price of 28%+ paid for the 12cP in Singapore.\n\nBoth my 12C\/cP sets were \"Made in China\" by probably the same HP OEM to reasonably high HP quality. At a glance, the HP12C gold apparently has better cosmetic finishing than the 12cP. In addition, the keys on the 12C does feel very much better than those on the 12cP.\n\nIn a nutshell, the 12cP is more of \"an alternative to 12C with ALG mode\" than an upgrade or a sucessor of the 12C GOLD. When choosing between the 12C or 12cP, it is wiser to go for the 12C the \"good old\" 12C or 12C GOLD!\n\nSmart consumers who do not need extra memory for programming and the ALG mode, should go for GOLD, buy the 12C GOLD standard until HP could produce a real and wholehearted improvement of the 12C line.\n\nThank you for reading my personal user experience with the HP12c PLATINUM.","summary":"A half-hearted upgrade is BADDER than no upgrade at all","unixReviewTime":1089590400,"vote":"215","image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51JEX8xhEXL._SY88.gif","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/418VcFlMEGL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41mMhAmUDPL._SY88.jpg"]}

Unfortunately, despite having an almost identical name, this is a very different product.\n\nIt's a nice, sturdy set of dividers with large, colorful, plastic tabs that you can label, keeping your binder organized. However, if your binder has page protectors in it, these dividers will NOT stick out past the edge. You can't see them at all, which renders them useless. Some of the other reviews said the tabs do stick out past page protectors, while some reviews said they didn't. They were cheap enough that I was willing to take the chance and see for myself. Well, there's a reason I don't usually gamble. . . . I lost, and now I'm stuck with yet another set of dividers that I can't use.\n\nIf anyone knows of a set of non-pocketed dividers whose tabs extend past the edges of page protectors, please comment to let me know! I need them for several different binders, but I have yet to find any, and I can't keep randomly buying dividers, hoping one will work.\n\nIf you don't need the tabs to stick out past the edges of your page protectors, then these dividers might be okay for you. I'll give them two stars, just because they might be useful for someone else. But for me, they're worthless.","summary":"Dividers Are Too Short","unixReviewTime":1436659200,"vote":"6","image":null}

The clips on the compartments are plastic that is molded right with the rest of the clipboard.  Not nice hinge clip like other boards.  It's VERY hard to open either compartment, almost impossible with one hand.  You have to bend the plastic clip out and over the stub and it is very uncomfortable.\n2.

The process was sufficiently inconvenient that I often just labelled the discs with a marker instead (a Sharpie isn't elegant, but it's simple and quick).\n\nWhen I saw this Casio disc printer, I thought it would be the answer to my problems, so I bought it.  Here's a quick summary of the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nThe good:  The disc title printer works with your PC, which is convenient when you want to design a more complex label, add a logo to the label, etc.  It also works as a standalone disc labeler, using the built-in keyboard, which is convenient when you're away from your PC.  It takes up relatively little space (about 8x8 inches) and can run on batteries, so you don't have to carry around a power brick.\n\nThe bad:  When using the printer in standalone mode, the interface is confusing (the interface when using a PC is much more intuitive).  Also, if you want to print a two-part disc label (i.e., one that has text both above and below the spindle hole in the disc), you must remove the disc from the printer half-way through the print job and put it back in upside down so the printer can finish the bottom half of the label.  This is inconvenient, and requires that you be very careful about aligning the disc each time to avoid top and bottom labels that aren't lined up.  Finally, the printing is limited to a single color (you have a choice of black, blue, or red).\n\nThe ugly:  Unless you buy the special CDs recommended by Casio, the printer often skips letters of the title.  Apparently a regualar CD-R surface is not entirely compatible with the Casio's thermal print head.  Of the discs I've tried to label, roughly 1\/3 to 1\/2 of the time the printing is of such poor quality that I've had to throw the disc away.  Now, I label the discs before recording -- I still have to throw away bad discs, but at least I haven't wasted all the recording time when the label printer messes up.  Another weak point:  The printer consumes batteries at a frightening rate.  The eight AA batteries that were included lasted for only 40-50 disks.  That's a AA battery for every 5-6 discs.\n\nIn a nutshell, if you need small size or portability (a built-in keyboard, and battery power), this can be a handy disc labeler.

My first Palm device, an M130, also had its on-off switch fail after two years (before its main board failed). Palm needs to understand that I have other things to do with my money than to spend $200 every two years on a PDA because they didn't make the on-off switch robust enough.

My wife's Treo 700p had its speaker fail after 45 days, and occasionally the phone portion requires a reset.

Jeanclerc","reviewText":"When it was first introduced, the Palm Tungsten E was marketed as an affordable treasure trove of applications - Word, Excel, MP3, Acrobat, photos, movies, etc.  With a color display and a price tag under $200, it seemed to have it all.  It does delivery nicely on all of that promise.  Unfortunately, Palm handicapped the E with one inexplicable design flaw that outweighs all of its upside - they somehow failed to include the ironically-named \"universal connector\" for recharging and syncing the unit.  Instead, it comes with two separate jacks on its underside:  one mini-USB for data sync and one AC adapter plug, leaving you faced with an unnecessary clutter of cords crossing your desk.\n\nIn the beginning, I wanted to give the E every chance I could based on its functionality, and so I was lenient on this design oddity.  Still, the inconvenience eventually made me hate using it.  The plug design basically forces you into a choice between two very imperfect options - (a) threading the cords to the front of your desktop somehow so that you can have it right-side-up and still use it while plugged in, or (b) putting the cords behind the desk where they belong with the others and then suffering with an upside-down Palm.  With option (a), the relatively short cords and large jacks also put the unit at high risk of being knocked or dragged off of the desk.  With option (b), even syncing became a chore - the lack of a cradle button to trigger a sync means that you have to power up the unit and kick it off via on-screen icons, all while looking at it upside-down or else yanking a bunch of messy excess cord onto your desk.\n\nStill, I wanted to make the most of the E's robust bundle of applications, and for its low price, I knew not to expect that everything would come standard in the box.  So I went shopping for a proper charging cradle, only to find that no such accessory for the E exists.  In fact, Palm doesn't even sell replacements for its individual sync\/charging cables at all.  So, aside from all routine inconvenience while using it, this model also comes with the incredible risk that if either cord is every lost or damaged, you become the proud owner of a sleek-looking $200 paperweight.  It's possible by now that some third-party company has begun creating unlicensed cords that claim to be compatible, but that's hardly comforting in the face of Palm's obvious lack of support for its own product line.\n\nAnd given the weak battery that the E is equipped with (and it can't be upgraded), you'll have it connected to the charging cord quite a bit.  When I was using it religiously every workday, I needed to recharge it each night.  What a disappointment this setup is compared to, for example, the Tungsten T3 - it uses the universal connector to dock with a cradle that continuously charges it and syncs it on command while keeping it at an ideal ergonomic angle for use\/reference while sitting on your desktop.  And since its using the universal connector, you're able to accessorize it further, i.e. buy a separate docking cradle for the office, a charger for the road, etc.  The T3 setup makes perfect sense, the E setup is shamefully inadequate - it's as if Palm wants E owners to never forget that they purchased \"the cheap one\".\n\nIn conclusion, its advertised plusses are very real, but go for the Tungsten E at your own risk.  Its greatest failure is that there is no obvious reason why it couldn't have lived up to its potential as the ultimate PDA.  The more you live with its one Achilles' Heel, the more you'll wish you'd spent a little extra on the T3.\n\nPROS\nVersatility and quality of applications that it runs (MS Office, Acrobat, MP3, photos, movies, etc.)\nBrilliant color display\n\nCONS\nLack of universal connector makes everyday use\/charging\/syncing more and more irritating\nLack of Palm support for the E, as in no replacement cords available, makes it a risky option","summary":"Lack of \"Universal\" Connector Ruins an Otherwise Great PDA","unixReviewTime":1119312000,"vote":"18","image":null}

Revelle","reviewText":"I have owned top of the line graphing and scientific calculators from TI, HP, Casio, Sharp, etc. Back when I was a student, TI's were very cheaply made and often broke quite easily and similar HP products lasted almost forever. This machine, the HP33s, continues that HP tradition and is definitely put together very well. It is however very poorly implemented as a portable HP scientific calculator and to boot the keyboard is very poorly designed, oddly assembled in a characteristic V shape and overall just not very useful as a professional device for hand-held computations. The pros and cons as I see it are:\n\nPROS:\n\n1) It has many of the standard features that we have come to expect on such a machine with the exception of statistical regressions beyond those that are strictly in the \"linear\" approximation (See CON below). Matrix manipulations and a few others are totally missing however, so be careful and look at the available list of functions before buying this unit, just to be safe and not sorry later on.\n\n2) The machine itself operates reasonably fast (in some cases it is actually faster than the now revered successor, the HP35s even though they have the same mathematical processor inside!).\n\n3) It has a nice and quite modern, curved body design that sits very nicely both on a desk or on a table as well as in your hand, but I don't like the \"feel\" of its keyboard.\n\n4) Either the famous RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) and an algebraic Equation Operating System (EOS) are available to be chosen depending on the wishes of the user and on the problem to be tackled.\n\nCONS:\n\n1) This unit initially had a absolutely awful decimal point problem that was even so bad that it was partially fixed by HP on later production units (since it was almost impossible to see the embedded decimal point, especially for certain number combinations).\n\n2)Some functions that you would readily expect to be available with a single key press require instead at least two key presses, but usually with only a single shift key press first.\n\n3) The RPN learning curve is quite steep, although very well worth the considerable effort, but this will heavily deter some good students from learning the RPN skills that can be effectively used for your entire lifetime once they are successfully mastered.\n\n4) The HP33s requires two coin cell batteries which are usually much harder to find than traditional AA or AAA batteries, but as a result the unit is almost pocketable and is very light.\n\n5) HP should have already added into the ROM the other standard common regression types (power law, exponential and logarithmic curve-fits) instead of having to waste valuable programming memory space for them after they have been programmed in by hand by the user. These as well as many more types are now readily available on both simpler HP algebraic-only machines (such as the HP Smartcalc 300s) as well as on competing similar models by both Casio (the FX-115ES) and by Sharp (the EL-506B or the EL-506WBBK).\n\n6) There is no computer user interface available at all or even an external power adapter port.\n\n7) It will not take the square root, etc. of negative numbers (it simply gives an error message), but many other currently available scientific calculators will readily accomplish this task. It will work with complex numbers, but this lack of full capability is very limiting in my opinion.","summary":"Very poor implimentation for a portable HP scientific calculator","unixReviewTime":1244764800,"vote":"3","image":null}

I bought it for the EIT exam and would not have bought it were it not for the fact it was the only RPN calculator on the NCEES approved calculator list at the time I took the EIT exam.\n\nThe HP-33s keyboard layout is extremely cluttered.  The chevron key layout is a major step backward.  The keys are very hard (reminds me a lot of the HP42s) and the tactile feedback is totally subpar and uncertain compared to other HP calculators, frequently leading to wrong answers because of incorrect data entry.  By this I mean that the keys don't always register a data entry when pressed, especially when I punch in a number quickly.  I always have to keep my eye on the display to make sure the number got entered correctly.  I don't have this problem with other HP calculators I've used in the past.  Prior to buying the HP-33s, I owned an HP-41c, HP-42s, HP-19BII, HP-12, HP-17BII and every single one of these is far better constructed than the HP-33s.\n\nI disliked this calculator so much that I never bothered to learn how to use it beyond the most elementary functions required for my EIT exam.  The only positive I can say about it is the rubber friction grips on the two sides is a good feature to prevent the calculator from being dropped.\n\nI think it's too convenient to blame the low quality on the fact that it's \"made in China.\"  Older HPs were manufactured in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia and were uniformly excellent.  One doesn't usually associate quality manufacturing with Malaysia or Indonesia, and yet older HP calculators from these countries were top notch.  The bigger issue is regardless of the country of manufacture, HP lost the will power to produce a top notch product with the HP-33s and instead cut corners to compete with Casio and TI based on price.\n\nNow that the HP-35s is approved by NCEES, there is no reason to get the HP-33s.  For only $9 more than the HP-33s on Amazon, the HP-35s is leaps and bounds better.  Having said all that, I have to grudgingly admit that I did pass the EIT first shot when I took the exam using this calculator, but it's probably more a case of \"in spite of it\" than \"because of it.\"","summary":"the worst HP calculator","unixReviewTime":1200268800,"vote":"4","image":null}

The 42's are the best I've used with a keyboard that is perfect for me.  I bought the HP-49+ on the web as no one carries them locally.  The calculator's calculation powers are very good -- those of us who went to college in the 60's and learned to do calculations with slide rules and all calculus problems by hand will shake our heads in amazement.\n\nBut HP missed the boat on this calculator by not demanding what was good about their previous calculators.  Here are my major disappointments with the product:\n\n1.  The keyboard is atrocious.  You can get a click as tactile feedback that you've entered a character, but that's not sufficient to see if it was actually entered.  As one reviewer noted, you have to look at the display.  This is a major, major design screw up.  I can only guess that the hardware was not designed by HP (contracted out to some Taiwan firm more interested in cost reduction).\n\n2.  Another reviewer noted the design screw up with respect to complex numbers.  I like to see my complex numbers displayed as either '1 + 2i' and occasionally as magnitude\/phase.  But, you're only given the choice of (re, im).  This was a major oversight.\n\n3.  The manuals are far from the quality of earlier calculators.  I'd desperately like to have a printed manual, but I guess such a thing doesn't exist.  The manual was also written by a person to whom English wasn't a first language (although, to be fair, it's much better than some other documentation I've seen from the Far East).  Finally, the manual should have been editted by an experienced editor -- there are just too many mistakes.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't have cared if the calculator was $150, $200, or whatever.  I buy something like this for long term use and the initial cost is not terribly important.  I want it to become a long term, dependable friend.  I still have my two HP-42s's and my HP-11c and I treat those with kid gloves, because they're not easily replaceable.  I do use the HP-49+, but somewhat grudgingly, as it's not quite the friend it should be.\n\nI worked at HP for 25 years and I'm a bit ashamed of this product -- it's not up to HP's standards.\n\nFinally, I'm not so sure of the place of this type of calculator.  If I have a significant problem to work on, I'll use my own software or some tool like Mathematica.  I can see how some of the symbolic calculations might be of use to a student, but I wonder how useful all those features are to the average user.  I think HP would do its customers a favor by starting up production of some of the popular calculators from the past.  The two I'd recommend are the 42s and the 15C.  The programmer's calculator in the 15C form factor also still appears popular -- anyone I know who has one certainly won't sell it.","summary":"Disappointing","unixReviewTime":1112227200,"vote":"25","image":null}

I mean, the printer FROZE my computer and there were HUNDREDS of crossed out (RED) printer icons all over my screen.  Then I began getting code imposed over my desktop screen with words like \"printer failed\" in the message.  Yes, at the time I had an Apple computer, but that's of lesser relevance...\n\nI called Epson, as my printer was still under warranty for about 8 more weeks.  They said they recognized this sounded bad and wanted me to send the printer in (at my expense, start the tab running $).  I did.  On the same call, they said they could either send me a new printer, or I could- under THE CIRCUMSTANCES I had- go buy one from a local store to have immediately and they'd reimburse me.  I opted to buy locally.  I bought ANOTHER same model while mine was in transit to Epson (tab $ increase).\n\nThen came the true frustration.  Epson spent NEARLY 3 months in \"processing\" my return authorization.  They acknowledged they had received it.  They would NOT reimburse me for a new one.  They claimed that they needed to determine if my printer was failing due to defect or negligence (I included SCREEN SHOTS in the return box of nasty printer icons covering my frozen computer, how can that be negligence?).\n\nAfter many, many calls to Epson service, they continued to say they could not yet reimburse me.  At one point, they even tried to say that I should NOT have bought one locally as their standard procedure would be to send a warranty replacement from their warehouse.  On this point they quickly withdrew, since I had phone records of who I had talked to.\n\nNeedless to say, after several months go by, I was told with finality that:\n\n\"Epson would not repair nor replace my printer because it was no longer under warranty.\"\n\nNow, I had a relatively NEW printer from them (this one started having printer head alignment problems in the first few months) and they had held my returned inkjet printer from OVER A MONTH from BEFORE my warranty expired.  Now, instead of being out only the original $250 for my original printer, I had patronized a company that had given me difficulty with ANOTHER $300, and also about $20 shipping, and about 50 hours of my time.\n\nI've had a Canon i950 6-color inkjet with borderless printing that I am extremely happy with since then.

If other printers' print heads go you pretty much resort to trashing the printer). It looks like the Pixma line is leading the way in printing and cartridge technology.

However, as I mentioned before, I have a small house (about 1400 sq. ft.) and the phone didn't work in much of it. People always complained that I was cutting in and out and they usually thought I was on a cell phone. It was worse than my prior, less powerful phone, which cut out only about half as much.\n\nNow, after seven months of moderate use, the phone has died. No sound goes in either direction. It's beyond the 30-day period during which Amazon will accept a return, and I am still waiting to hear from Uniden to see whether they will replace the phone.\n\nI now can't say whether the phone's problems all along were because it was a defective unit, or whether this is just a crummy phone, but I can say for certain that it doesn't merit the rave reviews given here, and so far, customer service from Uniden is non-existent. I will update this again if they replace the phone and it works better, but I must say, I have seldom been as unimpressed with an electronic product. Nifty features don't really matter if the basic functions don't work.

Although I certainly do not EXPECT your experience to be the same as mine, as an active consumer I wish to convey my frustrations with Epson care\/service\/support.\n\nAbout two years back I had an Epson Stylus Inkjet (forget which model now) that failed while still under warranty.  I mean, the printer FROZE my computer and there were HUNDREDS of crossed out (RED) printer icons all over my screen.  Then I began getting code imposed over my desktop screen with words like \"printer failed\" in the message.  Yes, at the time I had an Apple computer, but that's of lesser relevance...\n\nI called Epson, as my printer was still under warranty for about 8 more weeks.  They said they recognized this sounded bad and wanted me to send the printer in (at my expense, start the tab running $).  I did.  On the same call, they said they could either send me a new printer, or I could- under THE CIRCUMSTANCES I had- go buy one from a local store to have immediately and they'd reimburse me.  I opted to buy locally.  I bought ANOTHER same model while mine was in transit to Epson (tab $ increase).\n\nThen came the true frustration.  Epson spent NEARLY 3 months in \"processing\" my return authorization.  They acknowledged they had received it.  They would NOT reimburse me for a new one.  They claimed that they needed to determine if my printer was failing due to defect or negligence (I included SCREEN SHOTS in the return box of nasty printer icons covering my frozen computer, how can that be negligence?).\n\nAfter many, many calls to Epson service, they continued to say they could not yet reimburse me.  At one point, they even tried to say that I should NOT have bought one locally as their standard procedure would be to send a warranty replacement from their warehouse.  On this point they quickly withdrew, since I had phone records of who I had talked to.\n\nNeedless to say, after several months go by, I was told with finality that:\n\n\"Epson would not repair nor replace my printer because it was no longer under warranty.\"\n\nNow, I had a relatively NEW printer from them (this one started having printer head alignment problems in the first few months) and they had held my returned inkjet printer from OVER A MONTH from BEFORE my warranty expired.  Now, instead of being out only the original $250 for my original printer, I had patronized a company that had given me difficulty with ANOTHER $300, and also about $20 shipping, and about 50 hours of my time.\n\nI've had a Canon i950 6-color inkjet with borderless printing that I am extremely happy with since then.

It has something that binders many times the price have and that is a black cover over the panel without bubbles in the surface and it also has a clear plastic cover over top of that with a soft fit, and the seams on the edges and the hinge are compressed\/fused\/welded. It is also a relatively attractive binder. Yes it has a somewhat cheaper look to it like the ones I am reviewing have, but the biggest downfall is the ring locking tab failing to work on either side. You can press on it hard and the rings do not open. They start to but don't get there. Of course you could pull on the rings themselves and get it to open, and they do, as well as close, but the mechanism for me to give it 5 stars has to work properly.

Its multiple functions make it appealing to those who want a single machine capable of performing many functions. It is offered for a fair price, so it seems like the type of purchase where one can't go wrong.\n\nBut if one looks beneath the surface, it won't take too long to discover some of the flaws inherent in this device. I have been using this at my workplace for about seven months and there are many annoyances about this office machine that make it less than desirable. Starting with the fax, I like the fact that there are 80 preset numbers you can program for speed dialing. But I don't like the slowness of the feed and the slow, limited memory. I also don't like the fact that I often have to push the first sheet of paper to get the fax going. It often is unable to grab the first sheet on its own.\n\nFor scanning and copying, this device works ok but again it is very slow. I don't recommend its use for copying because the slowness is too much- you are better off waiting in line at a real copier than pacing back and forth while this machine attempts to make copies.\n\nPrinting is the machine's other function and here, it earns average marks at best. It feeds the paper through at a decent clip (17 ppm for black and 12 ppm for color), but it uses more ink that most printers. One ink cartridge sells for only about $20, but a single cartridge is good for only about 400 sheets using black ink (color cartridge costs about $35 and prints just 350 sheets). This is more costly than other printers in my office and that is the main reason why I don't use this device for printing.\n\nThis machine makes a decent one for faxing, but its other features rate either average or below. This isn't one of Hewlett- Packard's better printing devices and while I agree the base price is good for a multi- function device, I don't think this product is up to the usual high standards for a company like HP.","summary":"Hewlett Packard Lays an Egg","unixReviewTime":1133913600,"vote":"22","image":null}

While you can get most of the residue off by the usual technique of rolling a ball of putty over the residue until it comes off, this takes longer and is generally more trouble with the Blu-Tack compared to other brands like the UHU. That, combined with the blue color, makes this significantly worse than others.\n\nI have no idea why they made this stuff blue. There seems to be no valid reason for this.\n\nLike the two other reusable tacky putty products that I've used, this stuff WILL leave something that looks like an oil spot on flat wall paint. This doesn't seem to be a problem with glossy paint though. (Glossy is usually easier to clean in general.)\n\nI would certainly not recommend this blue stuff. The best comparable products I've found are the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/UHU-Tac\/dp\/B0000AQODM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">UHU Tac<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/3M-Scotch-1-Inch-Indoor-Mounting-Squares\/dp\/B000KKPHZ8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">3M Scotch  1-Inch Indoor Mounting Squares<\/a>. The removable silicone mounting squares are actually much better than the putties, but they end up being significantly more expensive per thing mounted on the wall particularly if you're using one for each corner of rectangular posters, etc. While Scotch seems to recommend against using these squares on flat wall paint, I haven't noticed any spots left behind. If anything they just don't stick as securely to flat paint but for me the stickiness seems to be good enough.\n\nSummary: don't buy this substandard blue junk.

This word was not in crossword or dictionary mode. Lapin is rabbit fur for one definition. Also another was \"fleawort\". This is a plantain for one definition.\n  However you could use \"wort\" alone and figure this out.\nOn one occasion there was a word that I entered spelled incorrectly. The dictionary brought up word re-spelled but there was no explanation. I don't know if there were alternate spellings. Most of the time it does indicate this fact.\n  Overall, I am satisfied with this Sharp dictionary.  I have changed the battery once with no problems. There is a switch on the unit you turn off when changing the battery. Easy. The directions are engraved on the bottom near the battery holder.\n  If it holds up it will have been and excellent purchase.\n\nUPDATE: 2-17-2013.  It did NOT hold up. There are so many reviews....but take your chances with this unit. In my case it now requires \"cleaning\" inside the unit. The keys no longer function properly. Page down has failed. I cleaned inside under the keys and that lasted a short time before the problem returned. Also, it  now requires pushing the reset button often for no apparent reason.\nToo bad because the display is clear, the dictionary very good etc. But QUALITY IS MISSING. Now to find a brand that will last longer than ONE YEAR!\nI can not tell you to buy this due to failure and poor quality control.\n\nUPDATE: 8-2013. The screen now has lines from top to bottom. If you buy this Sharp you should expect it to fail within one year or so. Screen failure, key failure, frequent reset required...simply a defective Sharp dictionary. Sharp is not resposible for the very good software from Oxford. They are responsible for the hardware. The hardware is poor. I would not buy this dictionary again. Other owners have had these same problems.\nSince this Sharp PW-E550 is a total failure there will be no more updates. Junk!","summary":"UPDATE...2013...WAS Near perfect","unixReviewTime":1323907200,"vote":"2","image":null}

As you might imagine, this is unacceptable.  I hadn't dropped it, so I have to assume that after a period of time that this is a defect that plagues this series of Sharp electronic dictionary.  It is quite a shame because this was an excellent electronic dictionary .  I've had to lower my rating from 5 stars to 2 stars because it is still usable - to a degree.  Sometimes, I can turn it on and there are no lines.  However, since there is no rhyme or reason as to when I get the lines or I get a clear screen, it is just not dependable.  In the interim, I have purchased a Speaking Franklin dictionary that I reference below in my original review. In addition, Sharp has no interest in repairing this unit - at least not for a reasonable price.  It would cost me almost as much to repair this unit as I originally purchased it for. quite a while ago.  So if you are considering purchasing one of these units, be aware that after a period of time, you will be left with a device that is unreadable when it gets lines up and down its screen.\n\nOriginal Review\nThe Sharp Electronics PW-E550 Electronic Dictionary&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sharp-Electronics-PW-E550-Electronic-Dictionary\/dp\/B00028DM96\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sharp Electronics PW-E550 Electronic Dictionary<\/a>&nbsp;is THE electronic dictionary to have in your reading and writing arsenal.  This small electronic powerhouse draws on 3 reference resources:  The New Oxford American Dictionary, The Oxford American Thesaurus of Current English, and Garner's Modern American Usage.  The end result: Concise and accurate definitions that are everyone can use - from a New York Times Bestseller wordsmith phenom or just a curious middle-America \"Joe\" like me.  The Sharp PW-E550 is easy to use - turn it on (the default home screen is The New Oxford American Dictionary), type the word you are seeking and press enter - the PW-E550 provides you with the definition (the unit automatically returns a suggested word list if there is more than one form of the word - scroll to the word you are seeking and press enter).\n\nNo need to press a \"Function\" button THEN begin typing.  From inside the word definition screen, you can press the \"Super Jump\" button, highlight ANY word on the screen and by pressing enter, the PW-E550 lets you see other definitions, thesaurus entries and any available grammar and usage entries.  The unit also provides you with the option of seeking only thesaurus or grammar and usage entries.  You can also enter the letters of a word you might always muddle when spelling and the unit provides that elusive spelling.\n\nChoosing The New Oxford American Dictionary certainly makes the PW-E500 an outstanding resource for not only definitions, but also technical details when necessary.  The defined words are often used in a sentence to illustrate the meaning in usage.  I particularly enjoy the word etymology provided in the Oxford definitions on the PW-E550.\n\nI've had the Sharp PW-E550 for about 5 years.  Thinking a newer electronic dictionary would be of even more use to me, I recently (April 2011) ordered a newer electronic dictionary.  Boy was I wrong - big mistake on my part.  I ordered the Franklin Speaking Electronic Dictionary SCD-2100.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Franklin-Speaking-Merriam-Webster-Collegiate-Dictionary-11th-Edition-SCD-2100\/dp\/B002B3YBYU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Franklin  Speaking Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary 11th Edition (SCD-2100)<\/a>&nbsp;Although the Franklin unit has 250,00 more base definitions and 150,000 more thesaurus entries, the Sharp PW-E550 is still a far superior unit.  The definitions in the Franklin unit literally used variations of a defined word in providing the definition of the word.  For me, such a \"definition\" is useless.  If I don't know the meaning of a particular word, I certainly won't understand a definition that uses a variation of the word I don't understand.  I returned the Franklin unit to Amazon.com after a few days of using the unit side-by-side with the Sharp PW-E550.  The definitions in the PW-E550 are concise, and the unit is much easier to use than the Franklin unit..\n\nThe only critique I have of the PW-E550 is the lack of a backlit screen.  Although it is not a feature that I was seeking, please note that the PW-E550 is NOT a speaking electronic dictionary.  Perhaps Sharp will incorporate this feature when (if) it updates the PW-E550.","summary":"Problems After A Time","unixReviewTime":1302048000,"vote":"2","image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/31M-AoRy5ZL._SY88.jpg"]}

So, the phone rings, you answer and it disconnects the person calling while you are greeted with the \"Welcome\" screen as the system resets itself.  After about a minute or so, you're able to receive calls again.  As an added bonus, it occasionally screeches super loud feedback into your ear instead of connecting you to the call you are answering.  Seriously, it hurts your eardrums something awful.\n\nThe signal is VERY fussy too.  It doesn't like working when near metal objects like restaurant refrigerators and other large appliances, nor does it work very well if any masonry walls are between you and the base.\n\nTerrible phone system.

The remaining handsets, all within 25 feet of the base, sound good on my end but apparently not so great on the other parties' end.\n\nOther drawbacks are an incredibly clumsy paging system, a caller ID call-back system that requires extra steps to select the dialing method each time (i.e., area code, 1+ or just the 7 digits must be selected every time), the need to setup the phonebook and speed dial on each handset individually, awful sound quality in both directions when using the handsets' speakerphone (dys)function, and lastly (but not least!), the inability to ever silence the base ringer.\n\nOn the plus side, the base speaker phone is superb and actually sounds better to callers than does the handset.\n\nTo say the least, I am really disappointed and terribly sorry I didn't keep all the boxes and packaging.","summary":"Woefully inadequate.","unixReviewTime":1120176000,"vote":"12","image":null}

I did teach myself a trick after customer service basically told me that it was a disposable trimmer. I should give a 1 star review due the lies that were told about getting blades or more importantly, not being able to get it to cut when it wears out and that I needed to replace the whole unit. Bollix! Well DO this step by step and it will operate like brand new. 1) Take the three small screws out of the back that hold the ruler edge guide to the front and remove the front guide and flip it over. 2) Using two 17mm wrenches, put one the inner nut to hold it in place and back off on the outer nut several turns. 3) Tighten the inner nut about 1\/2 a revolution and flip it over and move the cutting arm up and down to see if the get that tight cutting sound like when it was new, cut a piece of plastic bread bag and if it cuts without missing some spots it is tight enough and the outer bolt can be tighten against the inner nut and then you can reassemble the machine for a like new cut PERIOD.....TAKE THAT SWINGLINE>>>> AN UPPERCUT@@","summary":"No Replacement Blades But I Can Teach You to Fix the Cut So You Can Keep It Working Like New","unixReviewTime":1378080000,"vote":null,"image":null}

We tried two models - this, and a more professional $110 Amzdeal model - http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00CI02DSM\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CI02DSM&linkCode=as2&tag=allofthetech-20&linkId=63BWPYOBKAPWQAM6\n\nIf you need the cheapest cutter possible, the Swingline works. It's a little better and a little faster than using scissors, but we found that it was only able to cut about three sheets of cardstock at once, and the lack of clamping meant that longer cuts would drift by up to 1\/16th. No good if you're trying to do precision work!\n\nWhen we bought the Swingline, we managed to catch it at one of its low swings, when it was only $26. At $40, the $110 Amzdeal becomes a much better value - we're returning our Swingline and sticking with the Amzdeal. It's a much sturdier machine (the Swingline, made of plastic, actually flexes when you cut). If also provides much better measurement and clamping options, so we're able to get the exact same cut, with no drift, every time. Not only that, this machine is capable of cutting DOZENS of sheets of cardstock, compared to the Swingline's three. Several print shops have noted that they use the Amzdeal paper cutter, vs more \"professional\" cutters that cost thousands of dollars. If that's not an official endorsement, I don't know what is!\n\nI hope you found this helpful, and came away with a better understanding of the tradeoffs between the two options.\n\n---\n\nUPDATE: As a bonus, I thought I'd share our experience with several cardstocks from Amazon that you might be considering for your new paper cutter. In prototyping our card game, we purchased two papers:\n\n67lb Neenah ($7\/250) - http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006P1ER8O\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006P1ER8O&linkCode=as2&tag=allofthetech-20&linkId=26N2OTI3MIGHBIE5\n\n110lb Wausau ($20\/250) - http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000ETXY78\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000ETXY78&linkCode=as2&tag=allofthetech-20&linkId=PSQ4523DO2KELRFI\n\nFirstly, the \"weight\" ratings on paper are incredibly confusing and misleading. There's a dozen different ways to measure weight, things like \"cover, index bristol, bristol and tag\", etc - so you can pretty much ignore the manufacturer's rating as a reliable indication of which paper is thicker \/ by how much.\n\nEven though the rated weight of the Wasau paper was significantly higher (110 vs 67), we could barely tell the difference in hand. The only reliable way we could tell the difference was that this paper had a rougher texture - so that should be your primary decision point, not how much heavier one claims to be compared to the other's claim.\n\nOf course, since this paper is a third the cost, unless you *really* want smoother paper, I'd recommend going with the Nennah at a third the cost","summary":"Cutting to the chase - a product comparison","unixReviewTime":1433635200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It is very attractive, it is solid, the blade is sharp, and the grids are marked in inches (my last cutter was both inches and metric, and I got a headache just looking at it).  So, it arrived yesterday, and the first thing I did was to take 3 pieces of paper, true square, and cut them on all 4 sides, being careful to hold the back snugly against the guide.  Not one of them was cut accurately.  Now, I'm not talking about 1\/8\" off, or even 1\/16\", but 1\/32\" for sure.  I do not want to guess which of my edges are going to be straight.\n\nAlso, instead of being on the outside of the blade, where it usually is, the safety hook goes from the left side and across the top of the handle, which I find very annoying.\n\nIn addition, there is a note on the surface telling you to make sure to pull the blade to the left, toward the board, as you're cutting.  In my experience, this means that pretty soon, it will not cut the bottom of the page unless you do this.\n\nIf these things don't bother you, you will be happy with this cutter.  I printed out the return label and returned it today.

With origami, you have to get the cut exactly perfect and exactly square for the end result to come out properly. I'm often doing shapes for weddings or special occasions where there is an unusual request. I'll need to make large origami cranes from vellum, or watercolored origami lotus flowers, or that sort of thing. So I need a cutter that can do the job. I wouldn't dream of trying to do these by hand with scissors.\n\nThe guillotine might be fine for cutting coupons, or separating tax forms, or other things where it doesn't have to be precise. But I find that the drawing motion of the blade pulls the paper and, despite my best efforts, won't make an exactly perfect cut. With the rolling cutters, there's no issue at all. It's exactly perfect. Plus it's far easier and safer.\n\nThis unit is pretty much all lightweight plastic and doesn't feel sturdy. The blade does lock with a safety catch, but I wouldn't want this around kids. It's fairly sharp. So you have a sharp blade but it doesn't make precise cuts.\n\nTo make things a little worse, their guide lines are fairly fat, so you're not able to make a precise measurement, either.\n\nSo I'm not sure where I'd recommend this. In just about every situation where I could see someone using this, I could see them using the rotary one instead, and the rotary one would work better. Still, I'll give it three stars for being at least reasonably ok at performing its task.\n\nWe were sent a review copy by the Amazon vine program.","summary":"I Prefer the Rolling Cutters","unixReviewTime":1392854400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Unfortunately it's very hard to get them correct with this trimmer. First, the guides are relatively wide compared to other cutters, so it's hard to know where precisely to line the paper up. The other issue is that the guide in the middle of the cutter is further down on this larger size than on the smaller model. This makes is much more difficult to line paper up if you are cutting to sizes of around 6 inches or less, which I very often am (cutting 12x12 scrapbook paper to 6x6). It doesn't handle multiple sheets particularly well, I could do about 3 or 4 before I started having issues, but it's the accuracy of it that is the biggest issue for me personally. If you don't need perfect cuts though it's a good enough trimmer and certainly will do the trick for photo use and other less critical jobs.","summary":"Cuts well but not the one to get if you need accuracy","unixReviewTime":1391212800,"vote":"6","image":null}

The Office Mate II has the old fashioned huge square letters we are all used to, but the product does have a catch. The included wheel doesn't include everything you need for modern day labeling such symbols such as: \", ', @, -, _, ;, \/, and the accessory wheels with these seems to be completely obsolete now, I couldn't find them for sale anywhere. I'm guessing they don't make them anymore.\n\nWith that said, the device came with 2 rolls of back 3\/8\" tape (so not the 1 roll of 1\/2\" tape as in the listing). Other users say the letters doesn't align right, but you have to look carefully when inserting your tape. There is one track for 1\/2\" and another for the 3\/8\", if you get that right, the labels will be aligned right. You can see in my photos it is easy to label with it, although you do need a lot of force in the hand and doing nonstop labeling is almost impossible as your hands will get tired.\n\nMy main issue with this and why I gave it a 3 star rating is because it doesn't include the dash symbol \"-\" and I had to makeshift doing it with a flat head screwdriver and a hammer. Which that was included.","summary":"Ok labeler with a catch.","unixReviewTime":1523664000,"vote":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61m2T1ab00L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71PJREncl1L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/712BuaQLwmL._SY88.jpg"]}

I also purchased a Canon Pixma MG6120 printer along with these as my last HP Photosmart although good, was getting out dated and I wanted to make sure that I have a good printer to print a lot of my business documents on.  I know it sounds like i'm going on and on about printers but that is a large part about printing these cards in quality fashion but enough about the printer and onto the actual review of the cards.\n\nI've noticed the background picture on my package is slightly different from the picture on Amazon (Maybe out dated) but it gets confusing.  My cards say exactly as followed as to avoid mixing up reviews.  Avery Ink Jet 8869 Print to the edge, clean edge Extra sturdy business cards.  White Matte finish 160 per package 8 per sheet 20 sheet count.\n\nCard weight\/quality:  These cards say extra sturdy, suggesting that they would be professional quality.  They are not.  They are not bad but I held up my printed business card next to my wifes professionally made corporate card and it was significantly more flexible.  I would imagine that over time these cards being stored in a wallet or anywhere else will take a beating and shrivel up considerably faster than a true extra sturdy card should.  In Avery's defense, I think they are trying to appeal to a more \"generalized\" market as a lot of users printers would struggle to feed the heavier weight card thus creating jamming issues and doing more harm than good.  I did not have jamming problems but one sheet refused to be \"fed\" into my printer for a while until I played with it a bit.\n\nPrint to the edge:  Holds true, I was able to print to the edge however I printed past the edge using the 8373 template as suggested by Avery.  It may not be a big deal for low volume printing but wasted ink will make an impact on your wallet should you print out several hundred of these.  Not sure if I can fully blame Avery on this one or if my business card creation software was to blame here, just throwing it out there.\n\nClean Edge:  I would say about 85% clean edge.  You still have to fold and tear apart.  I was really worried about this as I didn't want my cards \"Looking\" amateur made and shaggy.  At first glance they came out looking professional until you look up close you can see little tears in the edges of the card.  Not enough to be a deal breaker though.\n\nOverall:  I am starting a mobile automotive detailing business, I am not in the business of making ultra fancy professional quality business cards.  I would recommend these to anyone that owns a small business that would benefit from having a business card.  With that being said, if you are very specific about wanting a professional quality card the only thing I'd be able to suggest is go to someone in the profession of doing just that.  If you're worried about all of the little details it's probably your best bet, but, these sure are nice for someone like me who would just like something to be able to hand out when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nPersonal Note:  I will be trying Avery's \"Glossy\" business cards.  I printed a background color on my cards and due to the paper type the ink sort of \"faded\" into the paper.  When I mentioned that they weren't the sturdiest card I've ever felt and especially if you are doing a background color where the whole card is colored it shrivels the card just a bit.  It didn't bleed through which I am glad.  Being in automotive detailing the \"Gloss effect\" is sort of what i'm looking for, a shiny card for a shiny car.  I will update my review when I give these cards a try and compare the two so that maybe someone can make a great decision from the start without having to experiment a bit like me.\n\nThanks for reading!","summary":"Clean edge, print to the edge 8869...","unixReviewTime":1327276800,"vote":"13","image":null}

That's a big plus.\n\nBut there are some issues, and I've seen these happen on other printers, and creating new templates from scratch.  Maybe it's a template issue,\n\n1.  Paper is too flimsy and light.  The cardstock should have more weight to it -- I went to a symposium and gave out a few cards.  They loved the design, but it's still a pie-in-the-face moment when they tell you the paper should be heavier and have a solid feel.  That happened more than once, but it's possible I found all the pedantic people too.  But theirs did have a gloss coat, more solid feel, and did feel more professional all around.  There is more to image than design, even if design is a critical part to image.\n\n2.  Using the appropriate template in Word, the first 2 or 4 cards are perfect when printed.  As the remaining rows print, alignment is lost in the process - the last 2 cards are 1mm off.  I've tried many printers and there is a pattern:  Expect up to 6 to be fully usable, iffy up to 8, and never expect all 10 to be usable.  Note, a workaround is to not bother with frames or imagery that ties to the side of a page.\n\n3.  If you don't use a pigment-based printer, don't expect the paper to not smear the ink if you get it wet in any way.  (Note: clear lacquer can be used to get around this issue, if applied slowly, evenly, and with a couple of coats.)\n\nIt might be cheaper to get a professional service, or ensure a design is used that doesn't anchor itself to the border, use a colored background, or has a precise distancing between graphical elements - later cards would lose their 'balance' and also end up looking unprofessional.  Those with plain, nondescript cards will be suited just fine with the Avery cards, however.","summary":"They work, but...","unixReviewTime":1282089600,"vote":"3","image":null}

The first shipment of the D1`, Red on White, tape was delivered to us defective (even if it was delivered in properly sealed packaging.)  As has become customary, Amazon dealt with the malfunctioning tape smoothly and immediately sent another tape out, at no additional cost to us.  The second tape arrived in proper working condition and was immediately put to use.  The output was a cleanly printed label.  The price of the tape is reasonable; certainly in comparison to most Brother \/ Dymo \/ Endicia label rolls.

Small footprint, great connectivity to the PC and to mail programs like Outlook. Many, many applications written for it, some shareware, some you can purchase. Easy synchronization via the cradle interface, which is also the recharging unit.\nHere are the pros:\nSmall, lightweight, fits in a shirt pocket. Standard OS that is widely used. LOOOOOOOONG battery life. Plenty of memory for most text-based application. (8MB) Plenty of peripherals like a sexy little keyboard, a combo ballpoint pen-stylus, travel adapter kits,  car battery charger, IR exchange which works quite well.\nCons: It's fragile. Even in the brushed steel folding case I bought, the screen broke when it slipped from my hand. It's Palm OS, which means it doesn't have the advantages of the Pocket PC (former Windows CE) OS to run PowerPoint, (there is a new program for the Pocket PC that lets you view and hear PowerPoint.) It doesn't have color display. The screen font could be clearer (there are better ones on other PDA's) The telephone and wireless stuff isn't in it (that's either the Palm VII with built-in wireless or other brands.) No MP3 player, no voice recorder. And the battery pack is not removable, although it lasts plenty long.\nShould you buy it? If you want an organizer and email reader, this is excellent. It's what I use every day. The long battery life is a real boon to the traveler. It packs a lot for the money. The optional accessories are priced too high, but this is a complaint against the industry in general. You buy the basic unit, but to add some useful doo-dads, you can rack a significant percentage of the purchase price in no time.","summary":"The standard that set the standards for handheld PDA's","unixReviewTime":986601600,"vote":"62","image":null}

Example -- if you don't clear the call log before it fills up, you'll have problems picking up calls on the cordless handsets. So you may want to shut off the logging feature despite it's usefulness.  Some of the complaints noted in some earlier reviews no longer apply. If you unplug the base it retains the customization you have put into memory, although you'll still have to re-enter the time and date.\nI liked the menu setup for customizing the base set -- it's quite clear and it's reasonably logical.

By virtue of the printing technology, water may smear the print into  illegibility.  Likewise, businesses frequently do need to bleed to the  edges of the paper just to maximize the use of the paper. Most ink jet  printers, however, cannot, because of on-board, unalterable instructions  print all the way to the edges of a letter-sized piece of paper.\nBut,  again, if you're just starting up--or if you're printing for some  non-profit organization--this paper shouldn't be overlooked.  It *does*  produce great results, and the slick feel of the double-sided glossy paper  is just like that of much more expensive, professionally printed brochures.  To be sure, you want to ween yourself off this paper eventually in order  to project a more solidly professional image.  But as a short term  solution, this is arguably better than one-color professional printing on  ordinary paper.

The screen, even with the backlight off, is quite readable in strong, diffuse light, as long as you angle it to prevent glare. In dim environments, the  backlight works quite well -- especially if you use the \"reverse  backlight\" feature (white text on black background). (Open the QLaunch  menu and tap BACKLIGHT, then REVERSE.) MS Word 97 documents are transferred  easily to the Pocket Word format, and vice versa. MS Reader also works very  well, with two caveats: 1) the new ClearType technology is not used (it  works only on color screens), and 2) the Audible Manager (used for playing  audio books) can cause a fatal exception in Reader by creating a zero-byte  file called \"my\" in the Audible directory. (To delete this file,  tap START\/PROGRAMS\/FILE EXPLORER\/PROGRAMS\/AUDIBLE, and delete  \"my\".) As for Audible, it will be helpful only if you have a  superfast Internet connection or a lot of patience -- a 3-hour audio book  is 6 megs and takes well over an hour to download. Anyway, Reader does  work, and I've already read most of Mackay's \"Extraordinary Popular  Delusions\" on it, in small font, with no eyestrain. Other good points:  Character Recognizer is excellent; you can write almost normally. The OS is  fairly intuitive. And the device really does fit in your shirt pocket.

I was not happy with the 150 dollar price tag of the low-end palms and decided to do a bit of research.  The Handspring deluxe came foward as an acceptable choice but I was drawn to having a Windows CE OS.\nSo I looked into those and the Aero 1550 stood out as the most reasonable compromise between features and price.  I have both a desktop and laptop and while better sound and color were big draws toward its more exspensive breathern I decided on the Aero.\nI have been using it for over a month now and it has exceeded my expectations.  The synchrionization is easy and stright forward. There are many convinces for ease of use built into the Aero as well, such as a power check, most recently used utilities buttons, etc.  It was obviously a well thought out design.\nPerhaps the most pleasent surprises was the growing on-line community of pocket pc users.  I have downloaded excellent freeware versions of chess and tetris as well as a number of titles from the University of Virginia ebook library.  The games installed perfectly automatically and the .lit files (for the installed ebook reader) simply need to be moved to the file that synch looks at for files and they download right into the correct spot.\nI find I use my Aero in many ways everyday whereas my laptop can go a week or two without use.  I should not forget about AvantGo.  This allows user selected web content to be downloaded into your pocket pc web browser everytime you synchronize with an active web connection on your host computer.  I enjoy having actual New York Times articles, as an example, available to me in a convient format when I have time for them during the day. The text is very readiable but the small screen takes getting use to.\nThe only reason I did not give 5 stars is because it is monocrome and realitvely weak audio.  I knew this was a tradeoff going in, though, and I am still happy I bought it.  I see no reason at all to even consider Palms and Handsprings with this avialable frankly for what it costs, but maybe that is just me.

So I figured with the new M100 coming out it was time to look  into a replacement.\nHere's my overall impression:\nWeaknesses:\n-  Backlight is only useful in completely dark rooms. Palm's backlighting  (even on the old Palm Pro) is better.\n- Internet Explorer is a bit  sluggish. At one point I was doing something on it and it just froze for  about 10 seconds and then came back to life. You can tell it's trying to do  some memory shuffling.\n- Lack of color.\n- Serial rather than USB.\n-  it's not Graffitti. I keep accidentally writing Graffitti characters.\n-  Interface is not as simple as Palm. This device reminds me more of a Newton  with all its dodads.\n- doesn't synch with Mac.\nStrengths\/Stuff that  amazed me:\n- The notion of synching is very different from Palm. When the  Aero is connected to your PC it's like you have a LAN between the machines.  You just drag and drop what you want. Synching is automatic. This is where  having USB would help speed it up. This transparency is what I've wanted  since the Newton and finally someone has done it right.\n- The regular  applications are fast enuf. Calendar, notes, todos etc are just fine. I was  jotting notes and todos during a meeting today and kept up just fine.\n- I  have been able to view html pages although it can get a little sluggish.  One thing you wish for right away is for it to let you view in color. 16  shades of gray isn't enuf.\n- The PocketWord application is awesome. I  installed a research paper I wrote complete with diagrams, images, and  graphs and it all worked! No conversion required.\n- I copied an MP3 to  the device and it also played with pretty decent sound. I wouldn't really  use this feature much but I have often wanted to do a voice note while  walking so this might be a chance to try that idea out.\n- The battery  seems to hold up well.\n- The larger screen does make it easier to read  from.\n- Plugged in a 96M compact flash card and it worked fine. I thought  the specs said it could only handle a max of 64M. I guess not.\n- For $280  I have to say Aero is a better buy than Palm V. With all the hype  surrounding the color PocketPCs the media seems to have missed this little  guy.\nApprehensions:\nWill Compaq continue to provide OS upgrades for  this device or will it ignore it once the iPaq comes out? The Aero has a  hatch which contains the OS installation so if Compaq wanted to, it could  provide future OS upgrades.","summary":"Very impressive","unixReviewTime":967766400,"vote":"6","image":null}

After a transition period, you will be able to toss away your Rolodexes (I used to have three) and your paper calendars.\nFirst the two weak points (and the reason why this doesn't get 5 stars):\n-- The Visor Deluxe has 2 AAA batteries instead of a rechargeable battery. You have to replace them every couple of weeks of medium to heavy usage, which can cost $20 a year.\n-- The case is relatively bulky, although it will still fit in a shirt pocket.\nNow, for the many advantages:\nUnlike the bargain-basement Palms, the m100 and the m105, the Handspring Visor Deluxe, and all other Handspring products, have a FULL SIZE SCREEN. I returned my m105 (a gift) after a week of squinting.\nI can't emphasize that enough. With a monochrome screen to begin with, and the built-in difficulty of pointing and clicking on a Palm device, size matters.\nBTW, unless Handspring cuts the price of the Visor NEO, it is not worth the extra bucks just for a faster processor. All Handspring models also have an expansion slot for adding everything from memory to a cell phone to GPS. You will also need the Visor Deluxe's 8MB (the regular Visor and Palm m100 model only come with 2MB) if you want to run some of the cooler downloadable programs for your Palm. Three free programs that I use all the time are Mapopolis (free maps from mapopolis.com, streets are searchable), Vindigo (a restaurant and city guide with movie reviews and showtimes at vindigo.com), and Avantgo (a news service where you can get the likes of The New York Times, the Weather Channel and CNN on your Palm).\nIf you want to stay with Palm, but can spend a few dollars more, consider the Palm Vx. Although lacking in expansion slots, it comes in a super-slim package with a rechargeable lithium battery and a full-size screen.\nI recently bought one for my wife and another for me. The Vx's downside is that it comes with a slow serial cradle instead of the Handspring's speedy USB.\nI also have a friend who is very happy with his snazzy, expandable new m505, but in that price range I think a PocketPC might make more sense. Here's a basic product guide:\nPalm m100\/Handspring Visor -- Bargain basement models with 2 MB of Ram. Good starter models for the price.\nDistinguishing characteristics: Visor has significantly larger screen, expansion slot and fast USB cradle. Palm has slower serial.\nPalm m105\/Visor Deluxe -- Workhorse models with 8 MB of Ram (plenty for monochrome models). Visor Deluxe has bigger screen\/USB\/expansion slot, and is, for now, cheaper.\nPalm m125\/Visor Platinum\/Visor NEO\/Sony Clie Monochrome -- Upper middle class models. Visor Platinum and NEO have larger screen. All have USB\/expansion slot, although Sony's slot is only good for memory. NEO and Platinum are virtually identical. Sony has lithium rechargeable battery, others don't.\nPalm Vx -- Classic, not significantly expandable. Smallest full-function PDA with lithium rechargeable battery. Still the standard.\nVisor Prism -- Cheapest and brightest color Palm-branded OS, but bulky for its pricetag.\nVisor Edge\/Palm 500\/505\/Visor Pro\/Color Sony's...consider buying a Pocket PC instead, unless prices drop substantially.\nGood luck!","summary":"A steal at this price!","unixReviewTime":1006732800,"vote":"81","image":null}

I have struggled with the choice of the sleekness of the Ipaq, the sturdiness of the Jornada or the hybrid Casio.  I realize that all of these companies make budget models that either lack color or substitute serial for usb or lack a cradle or even cut the RAM in half.  These models didn't interest me.  As the Pocket PC is Microsoft based I new whatever applications I put on them would be bloated compared to the palm so a large amount of memory and a USB cable seemed a must to me.\nI chose the Jornada 548.  The Jornada has the slowest processor of the big three, E-125,  IPAQ 3650 and Jornada 548.  It also has one of the lowest color depths.  For all these faults I still chose the unit.\n My reasons are pretty straightforward.  The Jornada is cheaper than the comparable Casio and cheaper then the comparable IPAQ.  The second reason was the display.  The IPAQ display was gorgeous but out of my price range.  The Casio display was supposed to be better but in my humble opinion it stunk.  This became especially clear when using the Microsoft Reader function were the Casio letters looked purple and fuzzy versus black and crisp on the IPAQ and Jornada.  Lastly I liked the case better.  The protective cover beats the Casio unit and the IPAQ requires an additional piece to use CF cards.  (Sold separately of course:)\nI have yet to see a real downside to the slower processor unless I am really multitasking.  The TFT display is great indoors but is inferior to the IPAQ indoors.  Overall a great unit that beat the competition for my needs.","summary":"My Pick in the Pocket PC Arena","unixReviewTime":992908800,"vote":"10","image":null}

I am a  long, long-time user of Palms, and was quite a devoted user, have spent  thousands over the years upgrading my Palms, buying software, adding  memory, etc. to get the most out of them. And I'm here to tell you...there  is WAY more you can do with a Palm than Microsoft would have you believe.  You can do more with a Pocket PC out of the box than a Palm, yes, but there  is TONS more you can add on to a Palm, and most at a very reasonable price,  than you can with the PPC.\nHaving said that, the Jornada is a great piece  of hardware. The color screen puts the Palm to shame. It almost hurts my  eyes to look at my Palm IIIc now, it is so pixelated and ugly in  comparison. The size is close to the Palm IIIc although slightly heavier.  It's very nice to hold, sleek and pretty. My main complaint is the stylus,  I find it annoyingly hard to get out and I don't like the flat shape.  People are used to round pens and this one is flat. I tend to drop the  stylus, and have already lost one of them as a result, and came close a  second time already. Would also prefer a cover that flips all the way back.\nThe Pocket PC OS is much better than CE 2. However, the inability to  close programs was a bad omission, and I ended up adding Gigabar, a great  freeware program that closes and switches tasks, among other things. But it  is a bit buggy, and I would much rather that the OS included that kind of  functionality from the beginning. While speed is better than older  versions, I still run into things that take time, where on the Palm,  everything happens almost instantly. There are a lot more things on the  Pocket PC you will have to wait for. Some add-on software I looked at is so  slow as to be worthless.\nAbility to play MP3s is great, if you even  consider carrying an MP3 player around. You can turn the screen off and  still listen to them, which saves on batteries. In the car, add the DC  adapter and it will charge your Jornada while playing. You can also get  small volume boosters that will run on a single AA battery that can help  with battery life if MP3s are your thing. However, please note that no  matter what you do, listening to MP3s will drain the batteries VERY  quickly. Even with the screen turned off, I only get about 2 hours before  the batteries die on me. Similar battery drains occured when doing things  like using a modem or a CF card.\nMore bad news. There is not much extra  software out there. Compared to the Palm, it's really, really sparse. And a  lot of what is there, just isn't that good or as easy to use. This is the  biggest problem I have with the unit. I just can't do some stuff I was used  to doing, or in some cases, it would cost me WAY more. Some things that I  used my Palm for all the time, I can't do now at all. I miss wonderful  programs like DateBk4 and HanDBase. So easy to use and low priced. Not much  like that for PPC. I am so desperate for an easy to use and reasonably  priced database program like HanDBase, that I may go back to my Palm just  to have it. The absence of something like Pocket Access on the Pocket PC is  a HUGE omission, and one that *must* be corrected if Microsoft expects  serious users to switch.\nThe screen on the Jornada is definitely a little  hard to read outside, but if you use the Outdoors setting, it IS readable  other than in totally direct sunlight. I often read books while in my car  at lunch and find it easier than my Palm IIIc to read.\nI also don't like  how heavily it is tied to MS stuff. I use Quicken...Pocket Money directions  for Quicken users? Switch to Money. Thanks, but no thanks. Pocket Quicken  on the Palm does a great job for me. Same with pretty much everything else.  I prefer Eudora for email...with the Palm, I can sync...on the PPC, I have  to use Outlook. I almost feel like it is trying to force me into using more  Microsoft stuff than I already do.\nFinally, pricewise, it's going to  cost you more. You can now get a Palm for $150. Yes, you can expand memory  on the PPCs, but it costs money. However, a lot of times, you are getting  more for your money...I do believe the Jornada is worth the price more than  the color Palm is. But you still have to be willing to pay the price.\nSo  what do I recommend? It really depends on what you want. If you love cool  gadgets like I do, the PPC overall is a winner. I personally would probably  recommend the iPaq over the HP for the screen that is easy to read outside,  better expandability, and more memory for the price. If you don't expect to  need more than the CF I slot, though, the Jornada would not be a bad  choice. If you really love everything Microsoft comes out with and use  everything they make, this is the one to get. If however, you want more  options in terms of what you can work with and what you can do, the Palm is  probably the way to go.","summary":"Not a bad choice if you want CE, but could be even better.","unixReviewTime":969235200,"vote":"75","image":null}

The colors are brilliant, the paper feels like very close to the same as good photographic paper, and, for all intents and purposes, the final prints will have everyone convinced that it's a \"real\" photo, not a printed photo.\nHowever, I agree with statements from others - the HP inks, when printed on this paper, can be smeared.  Absolutely in the first couple minutes after printing it is very easy to smear the inks.  Be careful taking the prints out of the printer, and don't let one print land on top of another in the printer tray or you might see some of the ink of the first print end up on the back of the other. Since we are all probably used to having prints with wet ink for a minute or two after printing, this doesn't really bother me, but even hours (days, maybe) after printing, the ink on the paper can still be smeared.  I have not been able to smear the ink on the cheaper HP photo papers, so this surprises me.\nBut, if you are careful, I don't think you should have any smearing problems.  And let's face it, if you really need to have a photograph that is going to last a long time, you shouldn't be printing it with an inkjet anyway.\nYou do have to weigh the advantage of a really sharp, really color-perfect photo-like print with the disadvantage of having a print that is possbily smearable and runny, though. Hopefully HP can fix this problem, and give us super-paper that holds the ink *and* has super-high color rendition.","summary":"About as close to actual photographic print you can get","unixReviewTime":974851200,"vote":"29","image":null}

The Stowawy's size--both in the full-size utility mode and the folded storage mode--far surpasses the GoType!  The Stowaway is about the same size as the Visor in the bifold case when folded for travel.  When  expanded, though, it really does become a full-sized keyboard with plenty  of Palm-specific options like \"Done,\" \"Cancel,\" and  \"OK\" keys.\nWhile it can be used on your lap, it does help to  have a firm surface under it.  I find it much sturdier than the GoType! and  do not worry about breaking it.  I'm more concerned about damaging my Visor  than I would ever be of damaging the Stowaway.\nWhile it doesn't have a  built-in HotSync ability like the GoType!, the point of having a keyboard  is to have rapid data entry away from your computer.  If you were at your  computer and could HotSync, you certainly wouldn't be using a smaller  keyboard like the GoType!'s.\nThe Stowaway is certainly the best external  keyboard on the market, but at [the price], you really have to be committed to  being away from your computer and have the need to enter a lot of data  before the dividends offset the investment.","summary":"Fantastic product, but at a price","unixReviewTime":963014400,"vote":"52","image":null}

The keys were laid out alphabetically rather than QWERTY style and typing felt unnatural.  We also could not find any store that carried blank label cartridges - even the store we bought it from (Best Buy) didn't.  We had to order them directly from the manufacturer and probably paid more than we needed to.\nAlthough the old labeler still works, we decided to purchase this one.  It is a much better product.  The keypad is easy to use and the unit has some great features built into it. I like the fact that you can change fonts, or frames  and can print on a variety of colors.  The labels seem to stick much better than the Dymo brand labels we used before.  They adhere to surfaces that I couldn't get cellophane tape to stick to. Almost every office supply or electronic store seems to sell the label cartridges in several colors and sizes.\nI only have two negative comments about this unit.  First, sometimes it is hard to peel the back off of the label.  You have to try to get your fingernail or similar object between the backing and the label and this is often difficult to do.  Second, it needs SIX AA batteries to run. If you print a lot of labels you're going to be buying a lot of batteries.  I wish that they could have designed it to run off of an AC power source also.\nDespite these negatives, I think that this is great product.  It works well, is compact, and is reasonably priced.","summary":"Compact, versatile and easy to use.","unixReviewTime":983404800,"vote":"203","image":null}

I think the 6 AA battery requirement for the PT-65 is a bit much, especially if you don't print that many labels (like me). One or two of the batteries (Rayovac Alkaline) in my PT-65 ended up leaking.\n\nAnother minor issue may be the amount of blank tape at each end of the label seems a but wasteful and excessive.\n\nI think I will like my new PT-80 even more, so check into that model.","summary":"Nice little machine","unixReviewTime":1148860800,"vote":"9","image":null}

It is easy to use and the more I use it the more I find it indispensable.  Whereas before I might have scrawled a heading on a file folder, now I make a nice, neat, easily readable label that makes my files quickly identifiable.  It is an excellent alternative to the Sharpie pen for labeling family belongings.  Little children adore having their names printed and applied to their jackets (or arms).  The PT-65 runs on six! AA batteries but they last for years and the tape is quite long as well--26 inches I believe.  The PT-65 can print in capitals and lowercase letters in one and two line formats.  There are also a variety of other characters and numbers. One can buy other more expensive models but I think this model is a better buy for the average user.  I can see how a fancy model with more colors and fonts would be more  helpful for a business. My only complaints are that it is difficult to peel the backing off the tape (impossible for a child who doesn't have good fine motor skills), there is quite a bit of blank tape left on either side of the printing, and the tapes are relatively expensive. My labeler did not come with a manual but it can be downloaded from the Brother P-touch site.

I can't imagine life without it! Using a stylus, you can easily enter appointments, phone numbers, to-do lists, etc. by writing in the small screen.  The handwriting recognition is less than perfect, but it has come a long way since PDA's were first introduced.  Most letters of the alphabet are straightforward to write, but a few (such as K, Q, and T) require specialized, although easily remembered, strokes. Numbers are intuitive, but punctuation requires a little more study.\nYou won't find tons of features on this model, but I find that I rarely use everything it DOES offer.  Its simple gray and black screen is easy to read in both bright and dim conditions.  Have an appointment next year?  A standing one every Tuesday?  No problem.  Navigating the calendar, from daily to monthly to yearly displays, is a breeze.  I frequently use the alarm feature to remind me of obligations I'm likely to forget - it can be set to go off a minute or several hours beforehand. With a push of a button, you can go to your address book, to-do list, appointment calendar, and a Palm stroke tutorial.  Icons on the screen itself take you to the overall menu, calculator, and search features.\nYou can synch the information entered on the Palm to your PC, so you'll have two updated copies of all your information.  (The Mac requires a little more finagling than does a PC, but is compatible.)\nI highly recommend this for people who have not yet tried a PDA.  You won't be overwhelmed with bells and whistles, and yet you'll have more than enough features to suit your needs.  Its reasonable price also makes it attractive for students and people hesitant to carry expensive items around with them.","summary":"A wonderful \"starter\" PDA","unixReviewTime":1039910400,"vote":"10","image":null}

After one year of owning this printer, I've gone through 4 black & 4 color cartridges as compared to one of each cartridge for the HP.  It could be that they sell these printers cheap and hopefully make up the money on selling ink cart's (they're pretty steep in price).

If you don't print much but want to save money and get good printouts, this printer will suit.\nThe bubble-jet design means that the paper feeds downward, instead of in a tray, this asks for paper jams.

My 1st was a dismal failure (I don't want to go into it for fear I may weep onto my keyboard -- again), my 2nd was my Palm M125, and now my Visor Platinum.  At first, I figured just by the looks of it, this was going to be my PDA of choice -- but after the initial surprise (I was given this device by a friend for my birthday) I found that yes, this IS a very good product, but is it better than my M125?  Nope.  They cost roughly the same, have 8MB of memory...both are upgradable...fast...but for MY personal tastes, the M125's smaller size was actually a better selling point for me.  Plus it has Palm OS 4.0, a small but significant improvement over the Visor.  Sure the screen is smaller (some would say too much) but for me this is in NO WAY a problem.  The screen is crisp and very sharp, and I haven't had a problem with viewing it in different lighting conditions.  The basic advantage (for me anyway) of the M125 over the Platinum is it sits more comfortably in my hands, and it's smaller size makes it easier to carry and use...not to mention the multiple faceplates that Palm offers as well as other accessories, hands down I find myself using it more than my Visor.\nOkay, enough of the downside.  If size IS a problem for you, then maybe the Platinum could be your next handheld.  Personally I'd go with the less expensive Visor Deluxe, which does basically everything the Platinum does, but for about $70.00 cheaper.  But again, that is up to you.  If you are already familiar with a Palm device, getting used to pretty much ANY Visor product will be a walk down the same pathway (for the most part, anyway).  They both use the exact same graffiti script and, with small exceptions, set up virtually identical.\nA quick note, Handspring plans to slowly (but surely) cut back on their production of PDA's and begin to market cell-phone\/PDA's as they work to become a communications company.  They will be introducing their TREO phone\/PDA any day now (if not already) and they are nifty items, but again, the cost is prohibitive (for now anyway) for many folks who just cannot afford to have a 2-in-1 product such as this.  Personally, I've found that my cell phones wear out the more often I use it, and if I handle my cell phone as much as I handle my PDA, I simply cannot see it paying off in the end (but that is just MY opinion).  I feel the more you know, the easier it is to make a decision...and when it comes to PDA's and what is availble versus the cost, the more information you have the better.

Add to that, my size makes it difficult to tie shoes directly, so I tie them before I put them on, and use a shoe horn.  The problem is the tongue of the shoe can get pushed into the shoe, slipping it on this way, and then the fit is wrong.  I've tried to tie the strings to keep the tongue in place, but this had mixed benefits. I decided to try this two-sided tape, and it works great.  I cut about two, one inch pieces, put them on the top of the tongue, and stuck them to the shoe top from within.  The stick works pretty well and so I no longer have the problem.\n\nI believe the sticking power will also work in hanging some of my anime posters that tend to come down with regular tape.  I might try this on some hooks as well, but I believe 3M has a better product for that application.  This is not going to be much use for a carpet, windows, or larger applications, you don't get a lot of tape in the roll, and it's white, not clear, so unless hidden behind the use, you can see it.

This is very useful if something does happen to fall off the wall or the squares somehow get on the floor and pick up dust. Also, if you happen to stick them to a dusty wall and they fall off due to the dust, being able to just wash them allows you to clean the wall and put them back up securely.\n\nWhile Scotch seems to recommend against using these squares on flat wall paint, I haven't noticed any spots left behind. If anything they just don't stick as securely to flat paint but for me the stickiness seems to be good enough. So far I haven't had but one thing fall off of flat wall paint, and the only thing that did fall off seems to have been caused by dust on the wall coating the adhesive. But as previously stated, I just washed them off, cleaned the wall, and put them back up with no trouble. With glossy paint they might not even fall off of dusty walls. With flat paint use a lot of pressure to get them stuck down securely.\n\nSummary: good stuff, I'm just subtracting one star for the increased cost over putty. If you need to mount lots of stuff then the putty may be more cost effective, but otherwise I'd rather use these things.","summary":"Significantly better than removable tacky putty!","unixReviewTime":1345161600,"vote":"2","image":null}

I am moving into a new house next week and one of the former occupants got the bright idea to use a staple gun to attach all the shelf paper.  After spending 30 minutes pulling out the staples with a pair of pliers, I decided that I was definitely not going to go the staple gun route.  I didn't want to do the self-sticking shelf paper, so I went with these as an attachment option.\n\nThese are pretty good.  It takes a bit to get used to working with them.  I found it quite difficult at first to get the backing off them.  But once I was used to handling them, it was very easy to remove the backing.\n\nAnother thing I liked was that these seem to be pressure-sensitive.  So if you accidentally put one down in the wrong place, you can easily correct your mistake.  (I was making a lot of mistakes when I attempted to reach back into the far recesses of the kitchen cabinets in the new house.)  Once you have the mounting square in place, press firmly on the top or outer surface to create the bond.\n\nSo far I have been able to get these to stick wood (i.e., the interiors of kitchen cabinets and shelves) and Con-Tact paper together.  Once this system is in place, I can disturb the surface of the Con-Tact paper and not have it slide around (which I know because I laid some down and then practically had to crawl into the cabinet with it to finish off one corner).\n\nI haven't used this for exactly its intended purpose, but it has been decent (not perfect, but pretty good) for the use I've found for it.

I highly recommend it!  The price is less than on the maker's website, and it arrived in 2 days thanks to Amazon Prime.  The map has a nice heavy lamination on front and back and it arrived in perfect condition, rolled, wrapped in a custom plastic sleeve, and shipped inside a very sturdy cardboard tube with packing material in the end of the tube.  We have unwrapped and rerolled it twice now, putting it back in the tube easily each time.  Now we want to have it framed with foamboard behind it and without glass, to use pushpins to show our travels. Our only question at this point relates to the custom framing, and we will follow up here when we see how that works out.  The framer (at Hobby Lobby) thinks it should be dry-mounted, since there will not be glass to hold the map flat, and they don't have mats large enough for it, but they expressed concern about the success of dry-mounting it because of the lamination.  We are trying to get advice\/feedback from different sources regarding the framing, but if we do not get that, we expect to proceed with trying the dry-mounting since the map is so inexpensive , especially compared to the cost of framing it, and we could buy a replacement if the heat of the dry-mount process ruins the laminated map.  It appears the map is also available without lamination directly from National Geographic, so that is a possibility if we have to replace it, but I prefer buying through Amazon and love the price here.","summary":"Beautiful Map, Beautiful Addition to Home Office Wall","unixReviewTime":1349740800,"vote":"3","image":null}

That is why I love art journaling so much.  It is whatever makes you happy.  What brings your bliss?  Bright colors and loads of techniques?  Pastels with sewn in little bits and bobs or maybe you like to stamp images and color them in with panpastels.  GREAT, DO IT.  Do them all!  I always tell my friends who are new to art journaling to try everything you can at least once. You never know what might be the one thing that really brings you joy.\nOk, that was a little rant, sorry.  But this book is just lovely.  I took some images to give you an idea of what you're in for. But there are 128 nice thick pages for you to read or skim to your hearts desire which is nice for an art book with techniques.  And there are loads and loads of images to help you get from one stage to another.  In one technique where she paints some lovely little birds she has 6 pages and there are 20 images.  Other techniques might be a page or 2.  But they are all inspirational and with so many new items being released every time I turn around it is fun to find new ways to use things.  You don't have to be rich to art journal. Dina even shows you how to use butcher paper in your journal.  She also uses a sewing machine in a couple techniques.  You can't go wrong with this book, even if her style isn't your style.","summary":"You can't go wrong with this book, even if her style isn't your style.","unixReviewTime":1501027200,"vote":"6","image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81-y8qmjgcL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/718F9youz+L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Uq3sKuXnL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71M1ExbVmSL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/817ih23vW5L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Rhgb8iDjL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71eS9tViRwL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81yvlad3ftL._SY88.jpg"]}

I have read a ton of different books and articles and blogs posts about art journaling and different techniques and approaches. But \"Art Journal Freedom\" is really in a class all its own.\n\nInstead of telling you what you \"should\" and \"shouldn't\" do, or telling you there ARE no rules, Dina Wakley simply shares her own approaches to art journaling. Everything from materials to technique to approaches to composition and color is included in this book. I even enjoyed and found inspiration in the \"getting started\/materials\" section, which I normally consider a waste of ink in most art technique books.\n\nThe one thing to note, though, is that Art Journal Freedom is comprised ENTIRELY of Wakley's work. So if you are looking for a variety of examples in different styles, you may want to check out Dina's blog and see some of her pages so you know what the book is filled with.\n\nBut if you love Dina's style and the effortless way she seems to be able to combine different elements and come out with these brilliant, beautiful pages, then you will find SO much inspiration and eye-candy in this book. It's a must for any art journal library.","summary":"EXCELLENT resource for those new to art journaling and those who have shelves of finished journals","unixReviewTime":1361664000,"vote":"83","image":null}

It's so handy to have it on the fridge so I can use it, but the family can add things to it over the week. There are no excuses in this house for not having what you want from the store. I love how 95% of everything I need is on the list, but there's also a few lines in each section to write stuff in as well as a space at the bottom for miscellaneous items. I feel so well prepared when I go to the store now!\n\nI recently started meal prepping and it's changed so many aspects of my life. I used to go to the store and roam around picking stuff up that sounded good, but then at dinner time I didn't really have a plan for how I was going to cook them. It pretty much resulted in rotating like 3 regular meals and a family that was bored with my cooking. Meal prepping has saved me money, made us eat healthier and helped me be efficient with time. I use the \"What to eat\" pad to plan out my meals. I use my personal list of recipes for most days and then find a new one on Pinterest or in a recipe book for a couple days. I plan ahead with the timing of extracurricular activities, making crock pot meals and prep ahead meals when we'll get home late. I systematically chose a meal, look at the ingredients and then check them off this grocery list or write them in. I do that day by day so I know that I'll have everything I need and not end up with a bunch of extra stuff.\n\nOverall, for the price you can't really go wrong. It sticks on my fridge strongly, I even keep a \"menu\" piece of paper behind it with my regular meals to give me ideas and it holds that fine. I just need a magnetic pen now.","summary":"I feel so much more efficient when I go to the store.

When we hit the store, I'll cross stuff off as I go to make sure I don't miss anything. And sometimes I'll task my partner with grabbing 2-6 things at a time from nearby sections of the grocery store while I'm taking care of other parts of the list, and then we're in and out twice as fast.\n\nEven though our house is gluten free, I use the entire pad. You can check off noodles even if you're getting yourself GF noodles, obviously. And if you specifically want avocado oil or something, you can just check off \"oil\" and write \"avo\" next to it. The blank spots are super handy too.\n\nNow I just have to remember to bring it with me if I think I'm going to be stopping by the store on my way home!","summary":"Don't shop without it","unixReviewTime":1406851200,"vote":null,"image":null}

At first I thought that they were packaged together but were individual pads but when they arrived I realized that they are actually all glued together on a little book style pad. (Don't know if that makes sense... sorry.) It's really cute because that way they all stay together and don't get lost. It even has a box in the inside of the cover for you to write your name to mark it as your property in case you lend it to someone (or someone tries to take it...). The picture for this item is the cover of the booklet. The only complaints I do have is that they don't stick the best and tend to come off and also (for me personally, anyway) the lines are a bit too close together; since I have big handwriting it is a bit of a problem but others with small handwriting probably won't have that problem. Overall, I really like these sticky notes and would buy it again once they run out.","summary":"Cute and practical!","unixReviewTime":1405209600,"vote":"11","image":null}

I also want to keep my beloved older books, perhaps those with some financial as well as emotional value, in as close to heirloom condition as possible. Yes, my family reads books and,yes,we don't treat them with kid gloves.\n\nHowever, we also know that pasting anything into a book reduces it's value- with rare exceptions. At the very least....before using this kit, check out the value of your books before permanently attaching anything to it.\n\nSimply do a search online to see how books are priced according to condition. or use a reference book&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/ABC-for-Book-Collectors\/dp\/1584561122\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ABC for Book Collectors<\/a>&nbsp;on book collecting, one includes resources for appraisal  ( many are free). The book listed above - and it's link- is there only as one example of resources.\n\nHave a valuable book? Pick up an inexpensive edition and use the library kit to keep track of it. But keep the collectible copy as pristine as possible.\n\nWhy? Because  a valuable - pr potentially valuable - book which is described as \"new\" or \" like new\" is NOT a book which has library cards in it. Think your books will never increase greatly in value? So have other book buyers who later discover that a true  first edition of Harry Potter soared in value ( haven't checked recent prices on those). So while this library kit is definitely appealing and attractive, just be sure to \"vet\" or check prices on your books,especially those which are older or out of print - before using The Personal Library Kit.\n\nOtherwise,you could end up with books which go from valuable to being worth mere pennies. Just some cautions here.","summary":"Useful EXCEPT for rare books,please read review for specifics","unixReviewTime":1314835200,"vote":"11","image":null}
